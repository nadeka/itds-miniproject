L2181	u12	m1	ALONSO	Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
L2180	u23	m1	SAILOR	We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
L2179	u12	m1	ALONSO	We should have seen land.
L2177	u23	m1	SAILOR	We'll all go crazy...
L2176	u12	m1	ALONSO	He's the devil's child...
L2175	u12	m1	ALONSO	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
L2174	u23	m1	SAILOR	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
L2173	u12	m1	ALONSO	What are you listening to, chicken ass?
L2172	u12	m1	ALONSO	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
L2171	u23	m1	SAILOR	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
L2170	u12	m1	ALONSO	I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
L2025	u13	m1	AROJAZ	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
L2024	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
L2023	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
L2022	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
L2020	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
L2019	u13	m1	AROJAZ	If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
L2016	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
L2015	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
L2014	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
L2012	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If they agree to follow me, yes.
L2011	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Your life, and that of others!
L2010	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
L2006	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Excellency, you are right.
L2005	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
L1993	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
L1992	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am, Your Eminence
L1991	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
L1990	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
L1989	u13	m1	AROJAZ	You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
L2524	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
L2523	u13	m1	AROJAZ	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
L2522	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You can see for yourself.
L2275	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
L2274	u13	m1	AROJAZ	It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
L2031	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
L2030	u13	m1	AROJAZ	He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
L2029	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
L2028	u13	m1	AROJAZ	The Judgment is ours!
L2027	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
L2540	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
L2539	u14	m1	BEATRIX	What is it, now?  Tell me...
L2538	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I am busy inside.
L2537	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Can't you stay with us a little?
L2474	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
L2473	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They took everything...
L2472	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They tried... but I didn't let them.
L2471	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
L2320	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
L2319	u14	m1	BEATRIX	You don't usually ask.
L2318	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
L2123	u14	m1	BEATRIX	That's something you can't decide.
L2122	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't want you to wait for me.
L2121	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
L2119	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Thank God...
L2118	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	She said yes.
L1986	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I find that hard to believe.
L1985	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
L1984	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
L1983	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Are we going to argue?
L1982	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
L1981	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I haven't given you much of a life.
L1980	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I know.
L1979	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I could be gone for years.
L2432	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
L2431	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
L2430	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
L2429	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How far from here?
L2426	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
L2425	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Viceroy of the West Indies.
L2424	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Appointment to what?
L2423	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	My letters of appointment.
L2422	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... I remember...
L2421	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
L2293	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
L2292	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	May I ask by whom?
L2291	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
L2290	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
L2552	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
L2551	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
L2550	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
L2549	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
L2548	u17	m1	FERNANDO	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
L2547	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What does he say?
L2542	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
L2541	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What are you listening to?
L2501	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
L2500	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Father...
L2485	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Not bad.
L2484	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How are you feeling, Fernando?
L2440	u17	m1	FERNANDO	This time with me!
L2439	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to explore the mainland.
L2131	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
L2130	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
L2129	u17	m1	FERNANDO	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
L2128	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There'll be a time.
L2127	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want to go with you!
L2469	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them created by people like me.
L2468	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
L2467	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you see?
L2466	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Look out of that window.
L2465	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
L2464	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Call them.
L2463	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	All I have to do is call the guards.
L2301	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
L2300	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What...?  Do I have so many already?
L2299	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
L2297	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
L2296	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
L2295	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
L2287	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... for a commoner?
L2286	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You defend yourself admirably...
L2282	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
L2281	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
L2110	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
L2109	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
L2108	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Then you are too ambitious.
L2107	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'm not bargaining!
L2106	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
L2105	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
L2104	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	No?
L2103	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No...
L2410	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You never learned how to speak my language.
L2409	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
L2394	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You did the same to your God!
L2393	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
L2343	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ask him if he will help.
L2342	u25	m1	UTAPAN	He understands.
L2341	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
L2260	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
L2259	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says...
L2258	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... and also to bring medicine.
L2257	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- he has a God.
L2256	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To bring the word of God.
L2255	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Why?
L2254	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thousands.
L2253	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- how many?
L2251	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
L2250	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief knows.
L2249	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell the Chief we thank him.
L2248	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You come!  You speak first!
L2239	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Island.  Far.
L2238	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
L2237	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Say not here!  Cuba!
L2535	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
L2534	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Oh?  So you are a new man?
L2533	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	New worlds create new people.
L2532	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I knew you would.
L2531	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to disagree.
L2526	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll always be older than me, Father.
L2525	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I suppose we're both old men now.
L2145	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Give me absolution.
L2144	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I believed in you...
L2143	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You are bound by an oath, Father.
L2142	u19	m1	MARCHENA	My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
L2141	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
L2140	u19	m1	MARCHENA	May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
L2139	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
L2138	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How long?
L2137	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
L2136	u19	m1	MARCHENA	What are you saying?
L2135	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
L2134	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I am listening, my son.
L2133	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
L2132	u19	m1	MARCHENA	In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
L2046	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!  Don't!
L2045	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them!  Just lies!
L2042	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
L2041	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!
L2040	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn God!
L2039	u19	m1	MARCHENA	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
L2038	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
L2037	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
L1969	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
L1968	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
L1967	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
L1966	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Passion is something one cannot control!
L1965	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Father Marchena!
L1964	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
L1963	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
L1962	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	So was Christ!
L1961	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Esdras is a Jew.
L1960	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
L1959	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?
L1958	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
L1957	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
L1952	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
L1951	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Why do you wish to sail west?
L1950	u19	m1	MARCHENA	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
L1949	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How did you manage it?
L1948	u19	m1	MARCHENA	That's what it says.
L1947	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... That's in a week!
L1943	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
L1942	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
L2459	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
L2458	u18	m1	ISABEL	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
L2457	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thank you.
L2456	u18	m1	ISABEL	But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
L2280	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
L2279	u18	m1	ISABEL	Do they have such thoughts?
L2086	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
L2085	u18	m1	ISABEL	How old are you, Senor Colon?
L2082	u18	m1	ISABEL	A woman?
L2081	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
L2080	u18	m1	ISABEL	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
L2079	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	May I speak freely?
L2077	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Surely you can do anything you want.
L2076	u18	m1	ISABEL	I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
L2075	u18	m1	ISABEL	That she was impregnable.
L2074	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What did they say about Granada before today?
L2073	u18	m1	ISABEL	The ocean is uncrossable?
L2072	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
L2071	u18	m1	ISABEL	I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
L2389	u21	m1	MOXICA	You will regret this.
L2388	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
L2387	u21	m1	MOXICA	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
L2386	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
L2348	u21	m1	MOXICA	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
L2347	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
L2346	u21	m1	MOXICA	My horse doesn't work.
L2345	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We can't raise the wheel without it.
L2333	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
L2332	u21	m1	MOXICA	We don't need to know.
L2331	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
L2329	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
L2328	u21	m1	MOXICA	We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
L2278	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
L2277	u21	m1	MOXICA	And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
L2492	u20	m1	MENDEZ	We can't be.
L2491	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
L2490	u20	m1	MENDEZ	What's he doing?
L2165	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Twenty eight.
L2164	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you read?
L2160	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Come over here.
L2159	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
L2158	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And what do you think Mendez?
L2157	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
L2155	u20	m1	MENDEZ	God be with us admiral.
L2154	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
L2211	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You're right.  Let the men decide.
L2210	u22	m1	PINZON	You tell that to them!
L2209	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
L2208	u22	m1	PINZON	You bloody...
L2207	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
L2206	u22	m1	PINZON	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
L2205	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
L2204	u22	m1	PINZON	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
L2203	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The land is there.  I know it!
L2202	u22	m1	PINZON	We're lost!
L2201	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You think I don't know that?
L2200	u22	m1	PINZON	We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
L2199	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
L2198	u22	m1	PINZON	You must be mad...!
L2197	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Six days ago, yes.
L2196	u22	m1	PINZON	You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
L2065	u22	m1	PINZON	Immediately.
L2064	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Where can I meet this man?
L2462	u18	m1	ISABEL	Because he is not afraid of me.
L2461	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Then why?
L2460	u18	m1	ISABEL	I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
L2419	u18	m1	ISABEL	And who would you think of, for such a task?
L2418	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	He must be replaced.
L2417	u18	m1	ISABEL	Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
L2415	u18	m1	ISABEL	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
L2414	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
L2377	u18	m1	ISABEL	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
L2376	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
L2116	u18	m1	ISABEL	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
L2115	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	... Into a monk...
L2113	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
L2112	u18	m1	ISABEL	You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
L1931	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Yes, Your Majesty.
L1930	u18	m1	ISABEL	Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
L3778	u55	m3	FLOYD	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
L3777	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3771	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
L3770	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3757	u55	m3	FLOYD	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
L3756	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3750	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
L3749	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3729	u55	m3	FLOYD	She's wonderful.
L3728	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3721	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
L3720	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3713	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
L3712	u49	m3	B20	SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
L4300	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Roger.
L4299	u60	m3	POOLE	I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
L4298	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess not.
L4297	u60	m3	POOLE	I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
L4296	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
L4283	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
L4282	u60	m3	POOLE	It's the last one.
L4209	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L4208	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal?
L4199	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
L4198	u60	m3	POOLE	Two more.
L4197	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
L4196	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
L4193	u60	m3	POOLE	No.
L4192	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You're kidding.
L4191	u60	m3	POOLE	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
L4190	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
L4189	u60	m3	POOLE	Are you reasonably awake?
L4188	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Good morning. How's it going?
L4163	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
L4162	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
L4161	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
L4160	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
L4159	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, that's something.
L4017	u60	m3	POOLE	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
L4016	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess it isn't.
L4015	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
L4014	u50	m3	BOWMAN	But not completely inconceivable?
L4013	u60	m3	POOLE	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
L4012	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
L4011	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
L4001	u60	m3	POOLE	That's true.
L4000	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
L3999	u60	m3	POOLE	How?
L3998	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
L3997	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, I thought so.
L3996	u50	m3	BOWMAN	That seems very unlikely.
L3995	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
L3992	u60	m3	POOLE	Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
L3991	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
L3990	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
L3989	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh?
L3988	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
L3987	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose the idea was specialized training.
L3984	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No. I never did, either.
L3983	u60	m3	POOLE	I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
L3982	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
L3981	u60	m3	POOLE	Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
L3980	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It's possible.
L3979	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
L3976	u60	m3	POOLE	Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
L3975	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L3974	u60	m3	POOLE	Really.
L3973	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
L3972	u60	m3	POOLE	That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
L3969	u60	m3	POOLE	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
L3968	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes?
L3967	u60	m3	POOLE	It's about my salary cheques.
L3966	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What's up?
L3965	u60	m3	POOLE	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
L3964	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Sure, what is it?
L3963	u60	m3	POOLE	Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
L3945	u60	m3	POOLE	Okay, come on down.
L3944	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay. 
L3943	u60	m3	POOLE	Right. Just a sec.
L3942	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
L4368	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
L4367	u56	m3	HAL	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
L4366	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I am prepared to do that anyway.
L4363	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
L4362	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
L4361	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
L4360	u56	m3	HAL	I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
L4357	u56	m3	HAL	I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
L4356	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
L4355	u56	m3	HAL	Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
L4354	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
L4353	u56	m3	HAL	If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
L4350	u56	m3	HAL	I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
L4349	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
L4348	u56	m3	HAL	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
L4347	u50	m3	BOWMAN	The antenna has to be replaced.
L4346	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
L4335	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
L4334	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, it is.
L4333	u56	m3	HAL	Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
L4271	u56	m3	HAL	Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
L4270	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, it is, Hal.
L4269	u56	m3	HAL	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
L4268	u50	m3	BOWMAN	And don't you worry about it.
L4267	u56	m3	HAL	Well, don't worry about it.
L4266	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
L4265	u56	m3	HAL	Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
L4230	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
L4229	u56	m3	HAL	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
L4228	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
L4227	u56	m3	HAL	I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
L4224	u56	m3	HAL	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
L4223	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You probably also know that we found them okay.
L4222	u56	m3	HAL	Yes, I know.
L4221	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
L4220	u56	m3	HAL	Sure, Dave, what's up?
L4219	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
L4080	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
L4079	u56	m3	HAL	The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
L4070	u56	m3	HAL	MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
L4069	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What is it, Hal?
L4068	u56	m3	HAL	Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
L4007	u50	m3	BOWMAN	He's got a point.
L4006	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
L4019	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
L4018	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4010	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
L4009	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4003	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
L4002	u51	m3	C12	CONINUED
L3994	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well, what is it?
L3993	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3978	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Did they have any explanation for this?
L3977	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3971	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
L3970	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3693	u52	m3	CHILD	Goodbye, Daddy.
L3692	u55	m3	FLOYD	'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
L3691	u52	m3	CHILD	Yes, Daddy.
L3690	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
L3689	u52	m3	CHILD	Thank you, Daddy.
L3688	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
L3685	u55	m3	FLOYD	Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
L3684	u52	m3	CHILD	How many days until you come home?
L3683	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
L3682	u52	m3	CHILD	She's in the bathroom.
L3681	u55	m3	FLOYD	Where is Mrs. Brown?
L3680	u52	m3	CHILD	Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
L3679	u55	m3	FLOYD	One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
L3677	u55	m3	FLOYD	In three days, darling, I hope.
L3676	u52	m3	CHILD	When are you coming home?
L3675	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
L3674	u52	m3	CHILD	Are you coming to my party?
L3673	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
L3672	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm having a party tomorrow.
L3669	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
L3668	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
L3810	u59	m3	PILOT	I'll bet it's a fortune.
L3809	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
L3808	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
L3807	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
L3806	u59	m3	PILOT	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
L3805	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
L3799	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, how's it going back there?
L3798	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Thank you.
L3797	u59	m3	PILOT	Oh, thank you very much.
L3780	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
L3779	u54	m3	ELENA	Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
L3776	u54	m3	ELENA	Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
L3775	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
L3774	u54	m3	ELENA	Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
L3759	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, that does sound very odd.
L3758	u54	m3	ELENA	Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
L3735	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, where are all of you off to?
L3734	u54	m3	ELENA	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
L3733	u55	m3	FLOYD	How is gregor?
L3732	u54	m3	ELENA	Oh, that's such a delightful age.
L3731	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
L3730	u54	m3	ELENA	And your charming little daughter?
L3653	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, it's coming along very well.
L3652	u58	m3	MILLER	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
L3651	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, I think so. Just about then.
L3631	u55	m3	FLOYD	Fine.
L3630	u58	m3	MILLER	Well, shall we go through Documentation?
L3629	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, very pleasant.
L3628	u58	m3	MILLER	Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
L3627	u55	m3	FLOYD	Please, it really doesn't matter.
L3626	u58	m3	MILLER	Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
L3623	u58	m3	MILLER	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
L3622	u55	m3	FLOYD	How do you do, Mr. Miller?
L3773	u55	m3	FLOYD	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
L3772	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
L3768	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
L3767	u55	m3	FLOYD	Certainly.
L3766	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
L3763	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, I'm glad about that.
L3762	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Fortunately, they did.
L3761	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
L3760	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
L3754	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3753	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	That's right.
L3752	u55	m3	FLOYD	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
L3751	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
L3748	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
L3747	u55	m3	FLOYD	Really?
L3746	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
L3745	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
L3740	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
L3739	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
L3738	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
L3726	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes, really, thank you very much.
L3725	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you quite sure?
L3724	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
L3907	u57	m3	MICHAELS	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
L3906	u55	m3	FLOYD	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
L3905	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
L3904	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any ideas about the colour?
L3897	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
L3896	u55	m3	FLOYD	But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
L3893	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
L3892	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any clue as to what it is?
L3891	u57	m3	MICHAELS	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
L3890	u55	m3	FLOYD	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
L3889	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
L3869	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
L3868	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
L3839	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
L3838	u55	m3	FLOYD	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
L3837	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
L3834	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
L3833	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
L3832	u59	m3	PILOT	Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
L3829	u59	m3	PILOT	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
L3828	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3827	u59	m3	PILOT	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
L3826	u55	m3	FLOYD	What do you mean?
L3825	u59	m3	PILOT	Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
L3824	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you.
L3821	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
L3820	u59	m3	PILOT	We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
L3819	u55	m3	FLOYD	When do we arrive at Clavius?
L3818	u59	m3	PILOT	There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
L3817	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
L4183	u60	m3	POOLE	All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
L4182	u56	m3	HAL	Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
L4181	u60	m3	POOLE	Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
L4175	u60	m3	POOLE	Let me see the tracking alignment display.
L4174	u56	m3	HAL	I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
L4170	u56	m3	HAL	It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
L4169	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes, Hal, what's up?
L4119	u60	m3	POOLE	Opening pod bay doors.
L4118	u56	m3	HAL	Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
L4113	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
L4112	u56	m3	HAL	Roger.
L4111	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
L4110	u56	m3	HAL	I understand.
L4109	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
L4108	u56	m3	HAL	Five by five, Frank.
L4097	u56	m3	HAL	Roger.
L4096	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
L4033	u60	m3	POOLE	Thank you very much, Hal.
L4032	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4031	u60	m3	POOLE	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
L4030	u56	m3	HAL	That's true
L4029	u60	m3	POOLE	Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
L4028	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4025	u56	m3	HAL	That's true.
L4024	u60	m3	POOLE	Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
L4023	u56	m3	HAL	True.
L4022	u60	m3	POOLE	Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
L4021	u56	m3	HAL	I will if I can, Frank.
L4020	u60	m3	POOLE	Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
L5890	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
L5889	u85	m5	LEELOO	Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
L5876	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
L5875	u85	m5	LEELOO	Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
L5693	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	You know exactly where they are!
L5692	u85	m5	LEELOO	Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
L5680	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The case was stolen?
L5679	u85	m5	LEELOO	San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
L5678	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The case..with the stones... Where is it?
L5674	u85	m5	LEELOO	Napoleon... small.
L5673	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	What're you laughing about?
L5645	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	At your service.
L5644	u85	m5	LEELOO	Corn-i-Lius?
L5643	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
L5761	u99	m5	ZORG	I know...
L5760	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	You are a monster, Zorg!
L5756	u99	m5	ZORG	Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
L5755	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
L5754	u99	m5	ZORG	Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
L5752	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	They are robots!
L5751	u99	m5	ZORG	...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
L5748	u99	m5	ZORG	Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
L5747	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	No thank you.
L5746	u99	m5	ZORG	...would you like a drink?
L5745	u99	m5	ZORG	Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
L5744	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
L5743	u99	m5	ZORG	Why?  What's wrong with me?
L5742	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
L5741	u99	m5	ZORG	Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
L5740	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
L5739	u99	m5	ZORG	I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
L5738	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
L5737	u99	m5	ZORG	Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
L5711	u99	m5	ZORG	I'm fucked!
L5710	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	...We're saved!
L6266	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	That's what I'm saying.
L6265	u84	m5	KORBEN	And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
L6264	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
L6263	u84	m5	KORBEN	There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
L6259	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
L6258	u84	m5	KORBEN	Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
L6172	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
L6171	u84	m5	KORBEN	When is she not in trouble?
L6170	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Leeloo's in trouble?
L6169	u84	m5	KORBEN	Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
L6168	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
L5840	u84	m5	KORBEN	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
L5839	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	What are you doing?
L5833	u84	m5	KORBEN	Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
L5832	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Of course.
L5831	u84	m5	KORBEN	Good luck..
L5830	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	We have to save the world.
L5829	u84	m5	KORBEN	What kind of mission?
L5828	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
L5827	u84	m5	KORBEN	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
L5826	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
L5658	u84	m5	KORBEN	That's what I thought.
L5657	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	"It means, ""Never without my permission""."
L5656	u84	m5	KORBEN	Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
L5655	u84	m5	KORBEN	I know. I was there when she arrived.
L5654	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
L5653	u84	m5	KORBEN	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
L5652	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
L5651	u84	m5	KORBEN	Dallas. Korben Dallas.
L5650	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
L5649	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	She's an exception..
L5648	u84	m5	KORBEN	They all like this in your family, father?
L5628	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
L5627	u84	m5	KORBEN	So you do know her.
L5626	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
L5625	u84	m5	KORBEN	You noticed...
L5624	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	He's a she!
L5622	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The girl?
L5621	u84	m5	KORBEN	I brought the girl remember?
L5620	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Who are you?
L5617	u84	m5	KORBEN	She dropped in on me... holding this.
L5616	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
L5615	u84	m5	KORBEN	She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
L5614	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
L5613	u84	m5	KORBEN	Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
L5557	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
L5556	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	What are we going to do?
L5522	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Thank you, Mr. President.
L5521	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
L5516	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
L5515	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
L5512	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes..thank God..
L5511	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Is there anything that can stop it?
L5510	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
L5509	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	And then?
L5508	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
L5470	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
L5469	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
L5468	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
L5464	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	One more reason to shoot first eh?
L5463	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
L6252	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
L6251	u79	m5	DAVID	You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
L5913	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
L5912	u79	m5	DAVID	On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
L5911	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Where's Leeloo?
L5731	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
L5730	u79	m5	DAVID	I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
L5689	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Perfect.
L5688	u79	m5	DAVID	They really made her...
L5687	u79	m5	DAVID	I didn't know your size.
L5686	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
L5676	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Yes. Of course..
L5675	u79	m5	DAVID	Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
L5672	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
L5671	u79	m5	DAVID	What's she doing?
L5647	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
L5646	u79	m5	DAVID	Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
L5637	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
L5636	u79	m5	DAVID	Father, will you please explain what's going on?
L5632	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
L5631	u79	m5	DAVID	What is?
L5630	u78	m5	CORNELIUS	It's a miracle!!!
L6124	u80	m5	DIVA	They are... with me...
L6123	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
L6120	u80	m5	DIVA	I would like to have died in peace...
L6119	u84	m5	KORBEN	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
L6118	u80	m5	DIVA	I don't have time... I need to know.
L6117	u84	m5	KORBEN	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
L6116	u80	m5	DIVA	Do you love her?
L6115	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
L6114	u80	m5	DIVA	She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
L6110	u84	m5	KORBEN	...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
L6109	u80	m5	DIVA	Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
L6108	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo... is... she's...
L6107	u80	m5	DIVA	The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
L6106	u84	m5	KORBEN	Who?
L6105	u80	m5	DIVA	You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
L5670	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo..
L5669	u81	m5	FINGER	Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
L5668	u84	m5	KORBEN	"5'7"", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect.."
L5667	u81	m5	FINGER	So, just how big was this fare?
L5666	u84	m5	KORBEN	Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
L5665	u81	m5	FINGER	Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
L5664	u84	m5	KORBEN	Hello?

L5498	u81	m5	FINGER	How do I look?
L5497	u84	m5	KORBEN	I just found a picture of you.
L5496	u81	m5	FINGER	Don't exist bud.

L5494	u81	m5	FINGER	You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
L5493	u84	m5	KORBEN	At least, the cat comes back.
L5492	u81	m5	FINGER	Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
L5491	u84	m5	KORBEN	I was talking to the cat.
L5490	u81	m5	FINGER	I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
L5489	u81	m5	FINGER	Hey bud! Finger here.

L5426	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	When EVIL returns so shall we.
L5425	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	Time is of no importance, only life is important.
L5424	u92	m5	PRIEST	Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
L5423	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
L5422	u92	m5	PRIEST	Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
L5421	u83	m5	KOMMANDER	Take them and put them in a safe place.

L5792	u88	m5	MOTHER	They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
L5791	u84	m5	KORBEN	Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
L5790	u88	m5	MOTHER	You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
L5789	u84	m5	KORBEN	All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
L5788	u88	m5	MOTHER	I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
L5787	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
L5786	u88	m5	MOTHER	...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
L5785	u84	m5	KORBEN	Other than that... You all right?

L5812	u90	m5	MUNRO	Why not?
L5811	u84	m5	KORBEN	I'm not going.
L5810	u90	m5	MUNRO	Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
L5809	u84	m5	KORBEN	You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
L5806	u90	m5	MUNRO	You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
L5805	u84	m5	KORBEN	I've had enough good news for today

L5803	u90	m5	MUNRO	You're the only one left alive...
L5802	u84	m5	KORBEN	And the third one?
L5801	u90	m5	MUNRO	Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
L5800	u90	m5	MUNRO	Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
L5799	u84	m5	KORBEN	Just one... why me?
L5798	u90	m5	MUNRO	You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
L5797	u84	m5	KORBEN	Where have I heard this song before?
L5796	u90	m5	MUNRO	To save the world.
L5795	u84	m5	KORBEN	What mission?
L5794	u90	m5	MUNRO	Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
L6309	u84	m5	KORBEN	I love you...
L6308	u85	m5	LEELOO	Tell me...
L6305	u84	m5	KORBEN	Because...
L6304	u85	m5	LEELOO	Why?... Why would you need me?
L6303	u84	m5	KORBEN	Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
L6302	u85	m5	LEELOO	I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
L6301	u85	m5	LEELOO	But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
L6300	u84	m5	KORBEN	Exactly.
L6299	u85	m5	LEELOO	...Like love...
L6298	u84	m5	KORBEN	You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
L6297	u85	m5	LEELOO	What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
L6293	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
L6292	u85	m5	LEELOO	I want to sleep... forever...

L6270	u85	m5	LEELOO	...The rain falls...
L6269	u84	m5	KORBEN	I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
L6268	u85	m5	LEELOO	The wind blows... the fire burns...
L6267	u84	m5	KORBEN	Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
L6241	u85	m5	LEELOO	Protect life... Until death.
L6240	u84	m5	KORBEN	I told you not to read all that crap!
L6239	u85	m5	LEELOO	Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
L6238	u84	m5	KORBEN	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
L6237	u85	m5	LEELOO	I'm so very sad.
L6067	u84	m5	KORBEN	The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
L6066	u85	m5	LEELOO	You're nothing but a... a...
L6064	u84	m5	KORBEN	It's difficult.
L6063	u85	m5	LEELOO	And you can't concentrate with me around?.
L6062	u84	m5	KORBEN	I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
L6059	u84	m5	KORBEN	No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
L6058	u85	m5	LEELOO	I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
L6057	u84	m5	KORBEN	Where you going?
L6056	u85	m5	LEELOO	OK, you can turn around!
L6055	u84	m5	KORBEN	You noticed..
L6054	u85	m5	LEELOO	Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
L6053	u84	m5	KORBEN	You get that off the screen?
L6052	u85	m5	LEELOO	You know women normally change five times more than men.
L6051	u84	m5	KORBEN	Here we go again...
L5965	u85	m5	LEELOO	...Hoppi-hoppa.
L5964	u84	m5	KORBEN	Uh...
L5963	u85	m5	LEELOO	"Good! Do you know how we say ""make love""?"
L5962	u84	m5	KORBEN	Apipoussan?
L5961	u85	m5	LEELOO	Apipoussan!
L5960	u84	m5	KORBEN	"I know how to say ""Hello"". Teach me how to say ""Good-bye"", that's all I need."
L5959	u85	m5	LEELOO	Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
L5958	u84	m5	KORBEN	You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
L5957	u85	m5	LEELOO	All 900.
L5956	u84	m5	KORBEN	Which one?
L5955	u85	m5	LEELOO	Learning language.
L5954	u84	m5	KORBEN	Finished what?
L5950	u85	m5	LEELOO	What is... Make Love?
L5949	u84	m5	KORBEN	Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
L5947	u84	m5	KORBEN	"Yes! But ""love"" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!"
L5946	u85	m5	LEELOO	Love...
L5944	u84	m5	KORBEN	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
L5943	u85	m5	LEELOO	Apipoulai!
L5901	u84	m5	KORBEN	Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
L5900	u85	m5	LEELOO	Dinoine chagantakat!
L5871	u84	m5	KORBEN	Oh god!
L5870	u85	m5	LEELOO	Cornelius..
L5869	u84	m5	KORBEN	You hear that?
L5859	u84	m5	KORBEN	Uh..you're welcome.
L5858	u85	m5	LEELOO	Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
L5825	u84	m5	KORBEN	"I suppose that means ""Hi"" ?"
L5824	u85	m5	LEELOO	Apipoulai!
L5729	u97	m5	THAI	Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
L5728	u84	m5	KORBEN	At least I won lunch.
L5726	u97	m5	THAI	"You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: ""It never rain every day."" This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!"
L5725	u84	m5	KORBEN	The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
L5724	u97	m5	THAI	How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
L5723	u84	m5	KORBEN	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
L5722	u97	m5	THAI	Not going to open?
L5540	u84	m5	KORBEN	You're welcome..
L5539	u89	m5	MUGGER	Thanks..
L5538	u84	m5	KORBEN	You gotta push the little yellow button...
L5537	u89	m5	MUGGER	It's not?
L5536	u84	m5	KORBEN	You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
L5535	u89	m5	MUGGER	Uh..
L5534	u84	m5	KORBEN	Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
L5533	u89	m5	MUGGER	Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
L5532	u84	m5	KORBEN	Been here long?
L5531	u89	m5	MUGGER	The cash man!
L6314	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
L6313	u90	m5	MUNRO	Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
L5586	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	An elephant couldn't crack it.
L5585	u90	m5	MUNRO	This thing solid?
L5574	u90	m5	MUNRO	Wonderful!
L5573	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
L5570	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
L5569	u90	m5	MUNRO	Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
L5568	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
L5567	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
L5566	u90	m5	MUNRO	Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
L5565	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
L5564	u90	m5	MUNRO	Talk English Doc.
L5563	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
L5562	u90	m5	MUNRO	Have you identified it?
L5561	u87	m5	MACTILBURGH	Actually only one cell survived..
L5560	u90	m5	MUNRO	This is all that survived?
L6255	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	How much time is left?
L6254	u90	m5	MUNRO	They just landed in the desert.
L5774	u90	m5	MUNRO	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
L5773	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	I want your best man on this!
L5770	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	...What do you mean?
L5769	u90	m5	MUNRO	The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
L5768	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
L5767	u90	m5	MUNRO	I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
L5480	u96	m5	STAEDERT	I'm about to, Mr. President.
L5479	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
L5453	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Gentlemen?
L5452	u96	m5	STAEDERT	My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
L5451	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Recommendations.
L5450	u96	m5	STAEDERT	Wait or act.
L5449	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Options.
L5448	u96	m5	STAEDERT	Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
L5447	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
L5446	u96	m5	STAEDERT	There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
L5445	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
L5444	u96	m5	STAEDERT	Perfect, Mr. President.
L5443	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Is that better?
L5442	u96	m5	STAEDERT	I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
L5441	u91	m5	PRESIDENT	Staedert, do you read me?
L5407	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	To fame.. salud..

L5405	u92	m5	PRIEST	Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
L5404	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.

L5399	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
L5398	u92	m5	PRIEST	Amen..
L5397	u93	m5	PROFESSOR	..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil..
L5396	u92	m5	PRIEST	Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
L6225	u99	m5	ZORG	I'm not at the hotel!
L6224	u94	m5	SECRETARY	Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
L6223	u99	m5	ZORG	Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
L6222	u94	m5	SECRETARY	Yes, Sir!
L6221	u99	m5	ZORG	Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
L6220	u94	m5	SECRETARY	Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
L6219	u99	m5	ZORG	How's that? Can you hear me better now?
L6012	u95	m5	SHADOW	...I can't wait to be among you.
L6011	u99	m5	ZORG	The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
L6009	u99	m5	ZORG	Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
L6008	u95	m5	SHADOW	How's our deal coming along?
L6007	u99	m5	ZORG	Got it.
L6006	u95	m5	SHADOW	Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
L6005	u99	m5	ZORG	Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
L6004	u95	m5	SHADOW	...Not far, now.
L6003	u99	m5	ZORG	No... not at all.  Where are you?
L6002	u95	m5	SHADOW	Am I disturbing you?
L56281	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
L56280	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
L56279	u360	m22	ALOTTA	I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
L56278	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
L56277	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Yes.
L56276	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Is it about my teeth?
L56275	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
L56274	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Kiss me.
L56273	u362	m22	AUSTIN	To my health.
L56272	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
L56271	u362	m22	AUSTIN	'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
L56270	u360	m22	ALOTTA	That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
L56269	u362	m22	AUSTIN	'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
L56268	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
L56267	u360	m22	ALOTTA	How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
L56266	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Sak-i it to me!
L56265	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Care for some saki?
L56264	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Or sometimes not at all.
L56263	u360	m22	ALOTTA	In Japan, men come first and women come second.
L56262	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Groovy.
L56261	u360	m22	ALOTTA	May I wash you?
L56260	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
L56259	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
L56258	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Come in.
L56257	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Behave!
L56256	u360	m22	ALOTTA	It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
L56255	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I didn't, baby, you just told me.
L56254	u360	m22	ALOTTA	Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
L56253	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
L56252	u360	m22	ALOTTA	You may.
L56251	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
L56250	u360	m22	ALOTTA	What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
L56249	u362	m22	AUSTIN	What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
L56248	u360	m22	ALOTTA	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
L56247	u362	m22	AUSTIN	You seem surprised to see me.
L55905	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Smashing!
L55904	u361	m22	ANDY WARHOL	Fifteen minutes of fame? I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
L55903	u362	m22	AUSTIN	If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
L55902	u361	m22	ANDY WARHOL	I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
L55901	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
L55900	u361	m22	ANDY WARHOL	Hungry.
L55899	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Hey, how are you?
L55898	u361	m22	ANDY WARHOL	Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
L56636	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful!
L56635	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes Basil?
L56634	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
L56631	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
L56630	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
L56629	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, I have something for you as well.
L56628	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
L56625	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
L56624	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
L56623	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
L56341	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thanks.
L56340	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
L56339	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes, Basil?
L56338	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
L56337	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
L56336	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	All right, Austin, I think you should go.
L56333	u362	m22	AUSTIN	You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
L56332	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
L56331	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
L56325	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That's not your mother, that's a man!
L56324	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	My God, Austin, what have you done?
L56316	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
L56315	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
L56314	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
L56313	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
L56312	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	What?
L56311	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Carnies.
L56310	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other thing you're scared of?
L56309	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Excuse me?
L56308	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other?
L56307	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
L56306	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
L56305	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Hello, Exposition.
L56242	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank you.
L56241	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
L56240	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes?
L56239	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	There's one more thing, Austin.
L56238	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Oh, yes. Thank you.
L56237	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
L56236	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes?
L56235	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
L56234	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank you, Basil.
L56233	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
L56232	u362	m22	AUSTIN	She's working on another lead right now.
L56231	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Where is Vanessa, by the way?
L56230	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Right away, Exposition.
L56229	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
L56036	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
L56035	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes?
L56034	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
L56033	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
L56032	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
L55984	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thanks.
L55983	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
L55982	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes?
L55981	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
L55980	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
L55979	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
L55973	u362	m22	AUSTIN	My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
L55972	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Vanessa's one of our top agents.
L55971	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
L55970	u362	m22	AUSTIN	You mean Mrs. Kensington?
L55969	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
L55968	u362	m22	AUSTIN	When do I begin?
L55965	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
L55964	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	We won, Austin.
L55963	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
L55962	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
L55961	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
L55960	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
L55959	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
L55958	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
L55957	u362	m22	AUSTIN	WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
L55956	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
L55955	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Where am I?
L55890	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
L55889	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
L55888	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes?
L55887	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
L55886	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Thank you.
L55885	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Good luck, Austin.
L55884	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
L55883	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
L55882	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
L55881	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
L55880	u362	m22	AUSTIN	We know all that, Exposition.
L55879	u363	m22	BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
L55897	u370	m22	MICK JAGGER	Groovy!
L55896	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Good on ya, man.
L55895	u370	m22	MICK JAGGER	You can't always get what you want! That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
L55894	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Well, you can't always get what you want.
L55893	u370	m22	MICK JAGGER	Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
L55892	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Hey, Mick!
L55891	u370	m22	MICK JAGGER	Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
L56580	u366	m22	DESTRUCTACON	Love is... love is... love is...
L56579	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Why not? It's a question.
L56578	u366	m22	DESTRUCTACON	That does not compute.
L56577	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
L56576	u366	m22	DESTRUCTACON	Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
L56575	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
L56574	u366	m22	DESTRUCTACON	Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
L56603	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Man, you are one chilly square!
L56602	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
L56601	u362	m22	AUSTIN	It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
L56597	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
L56596	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
L56595	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
L56594	u362	m22	AUSTIN	No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
L56593	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
L56592	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I've got you, Dr. Evil!
L56483	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
L56482	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
L56453	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
L56452	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
L56451	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
L56450	u362	m22	AUSTIN	What's wrong with your hand?
L56621	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Behave!
L56620	u377	m22	VANESSA	Kiss me.
L56619	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
L56618	u377	m22	VANESSA	I love you, Austin.
L56617	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Lay it on me.
L56616	u377	m22	VANESSA	I have something to tell you.
L56572	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'll secure the perimeter.
L56571	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
L56570	u377	m22	VANESSA	Austin, I'm coming with you.
L56568	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Don't worry!
L56567	u377	m22	VANESSA	Are you crazy?
L56566	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
L56562	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
L56561	u377	m22	VANESSA	I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
L56560	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
L56559	u377	m22	VANESSA	Likewise.
L56558	u362	m22	AUSTIN	It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
L56539	u377	m22	VANESSA	Oh, behave!
L56538	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
L56537	u377	m22	VANESSA	Austin, what's your point?
L56536	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
L56535	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'll hurry back.
L56534	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
L56533	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
L56532	u362	m22	AUSTIN	We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
L56531	u377	m22	VANESSA	What do we do now?
L56518	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Fair enough.
L56517	u377	m22	VANESSA	Shut up.
L56516	u362	m22	AUSTIN	It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
L56515	u377	m22	VANESSA	Yes.
L56514	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That's not the way to get ahead in life.
L56513	u377	m22	VANESSA	Indeed.
L56512	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Not a good time to lose one's head.
L56507	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Smashing idea! Give it to me.
L56506	u377	m22	VANESSA	No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
L56505	u362	m22	AUSTIN	All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
L56504	u377	m22	VANESSA	Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
L56503	u362	m22	AUSTIN	First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
L56456	u377	m22	VANESSA	Not now, Austin.
L56455	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Does that make you horny?
L56438	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
L56437	u377	m22	VANESSA	Thank God, Austin, we made it.
L56405	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
L56404	u377	m22	VANESSA	Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
L56399	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
L56398	u362	m22	AUSTIN	No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
L56397	u377	m22	VANESSA	You know who.
L56396	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Who?
L56395	u377	m22	VANESSA	Do you think she's prettier than I?
L56394	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
L56360	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
L56359	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Out and about, doing odds and sods.
L56358	u377	m22	VANESSA	Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
L56357	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
L56356	u377	m22	VANESSA	Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
L56355	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Hello, luv.
L56354	u377	m22	VANESSA	You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
L56353	u362	m22	AUSTIN	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
L56352	u377	m22	VANESSA	Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
L56351	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
L56350	u377	m22	VANESSA	Not in the Nineties.
L56349	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Only sailors use condoms, man.
L56348	u377	m22	VANESSA	No, did you use a condom?
L56347	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
L56346	u377	m22	VANESSA	I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
L56345	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
L56344	u377	m22	VANESSA	Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
L56343	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Of course, luv.
L56342	u377	m22	VANESSA	Austin, may I have a word with you?
L56335	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
L56334	u377	m22	VANESSA	Really, Austin!
L56228	u362	m22	AUSTIN	She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
L56227	u377	m22	VANESSA	It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
L56226	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I can't. You're drunk.
L56225	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
L56224	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Oh, yes you are.
L56223	u377	m22	VANESSA	I am not.
L56222	u362	m22	AUSTIN	You're smashed, Vanessa.
L56220	u362	m22	AUSTIN	No, this is me in a nutshell.
L56219	u377	m22	VANESSA	Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
L56218	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
L56217	u377	m22	VANESSA	Why?
L56216	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm sorry.
L56215	u377	m22	VANESSA	I haven't had fun like that since college.
L56210	u377	m22	VANESSA	Go! Just go!
L56209	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
L56208	u377	m22	VANESSA	Watch out, you're on my hair!
L56207	u377	m22	VANESSA	I couldn't have another bite.
L56206	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Fancy a nibble?
L56198	u362	m22	AUSTIN	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
L56197	u377	m22	VANESSA	I hate having my picture taken.
L56195	u362	m22	AUSTIN	No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
L56194	u377	m22	VANESSA	Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
L56193	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
L56192	u377	m22	VANESSA	I don't get it.
L56191	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
L56190	u377	m22	VANESSA	We can't just sit here, Austin.
L56189	u362	m22	AUSTIN	He's too well-protected right now.
L56188	u377	m22	VANESSA	Let's go get him!
L56187	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I never forget a pussy... cat.
L56186	u377	m22	VANESSA	How do you know?
L56185	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
L56184	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Let me see.
L56183	u377	m22	VANESSA	A limousine has just pulled up.
L56182	u362	m22	AUSTIN	We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
L56181	u377	m22	VANESSA	Why?
L56180	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
L56176	u377	m22	VANESSA	Do you want to talk to him?
L56175	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
L56142	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
L56141	u377	m22	VANESSA	Why did you leave so soon?
L56126	u377	m22	VANESSA	Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
L56125	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I can't see a bloody thing.
L56112	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
L56111	u377	m22	VANESSA	Here, use mine.
L56110	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
L56107	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
L56106	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'm sure.
L56105	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
L56098	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
L56097	u377	m22	VANESSA	No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
L56096	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
L56095	u377	m22	VANESSA	Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
L56094	u362	m22	AUSTIN	You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
L56029	u377	m22	VANESSA	I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
L56028	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
L56027	u377	m22	VANESSA	I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
L56026	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
L56025	u377	m22	VANESSA	What?
L56024	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Do I make you horny?
L56023	u377	m22	VANESSA	Sure.
L56022	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
L56014	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
L56013	u377	m22	VANESSA	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
L56012	u362	m22	AUSTIN	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
L56011	u377	m22	VANESSA	A Chigro?
L56010	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
L56009	u377	m22	VANESSA	Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
L56008	u362	m22	AUSTIN	My meat and two veg.
L56007	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'm sorry?
L56006	u362	m22	AUSTIN	My wedding tackle.
L56005	u377	m22	VANESSA	Excuse me?
L56004	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
L56003	u377	m22	VANESSA	I beg your pardon?
L56002	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
L56001	u377	m22	VANESSA	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
L56000	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
L55999	u362	m22	AUSTIN	My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
L55998	u377	m22	VANESSA	Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
L55997	u362	m22	AUSTIN	OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
L55978	u377	m22	VANESSA	My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
L55977	u362	m22	AUSTIN	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
L55976	u377	m22	VANESSA	My mother's told me all about you.
L55975	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
L55974	u377	m22	VANESSA	Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
L55996	u364	m22	CLERK	One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
L55995	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
L55994	u364	m22	CLERK	One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
L55993	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
L55992	u364	m22	CLERK	One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
L55991	u362	m22	AUSTIN	That's not mine.
L55990	u364	m22	CLERK	OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
L55989	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Danger's my middle name.
L55988	u364	m22	CLERK	It says here, name Danger Powers.
L55987	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
L55986	u364	m22	CLERK	Danger Powers, personal effects.
L56431	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Where did you learn to shoot?
L56430	u369	m22	GUARD	Noooooooooooooo!
L56420	u362	m22	AUSTIN	I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
L56419	u369	m22	GUARD	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
L56418	u362	m22	AUSTIN	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
L56417	u369	m22	GUARD	Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
L56416	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Don't mind if I do.
L56415	u369	m22	GUARD	Here, have a piece of gum.
L56414	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Here, have a piece of gum.
L56410	u369	m22	GUARD	Hey, wait a minute--
L56409	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Everything seems to be in order.
L56407	u362	m22	AUSTIN	Sure.
L56406	u369	m22	GUARD	Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
L55936	u365	m22	COMMANDER GILMOUR	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
L55935	u374	m22	RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, I have to log it...
L55932	u365	m22	COMMANDER GILMOUR	What's its current position?
L55931	u374	m22	RADAR OPERATOR	Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
L55930	u365	m22	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Shut up.
L55929	u374	m22	RADAR OPERATOR	In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
L55928	u365	m22	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Oh my God, he's back.
L55927	u374	m22	RADAR OPERATOR	It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
L55926	u365	m22	COMMANDER GILMOUR	What are you saying, son?
L55925	u374	m22	RADAR OPERATOR	No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
L55924	u365	m22	COMMANDER GILMOUR	Is it one of ours?
L55923	u374	m22	RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
L56058	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
L56057	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Right. Okay. Moving on.
L56056	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	Ow! You shot me!
L56054	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
L56053	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
L56052	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
L56051	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
L56050	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	We've got a lot of work to do.
L56047	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
L56046	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	Ahhhhhhhhh!
L56045	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Silence!
L56044	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
L56043	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
L56042	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
L56041	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
L56040	u372	m22	MUSTAFA	But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
L56496	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Please allow me to demonstrate.
L56495	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Really? Are they ill-tempered?
L56494	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	They're mutated sea bass.
L56493	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Right.
L56492	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Sea bass.
L56491	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
L56490	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
L56489	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	What is it now?
L56488	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
L56487	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
L56486	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
L56485	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Dr. Evil?
L56484	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
L56288	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
L56287	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Thank you, Herr Doctor.
L56286	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Quite impressive.
L56285	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
L56284	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
L56283	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
L56282	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
L56090	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Yes.  Scott!
L56089	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	My son?
L56088	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
L56087	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Yes.
L56086	u368	m22	FRAU FARBISSINA	Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
L56391	u376	m22	THERAPIST	That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
L56390	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
L56389	u376	m22	THERAPIST	We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
L56388	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
L56385	u376	m22	THERAPIST	Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
L56384	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
L56364	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
L56363	u376	m22	THERAPIST	That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
L56607	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Scott, don't say that...
L56606	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
L56605	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
L56604	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
L56545	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Show me.
L56544	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	What did you say?
L56543	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Blow me.
L56542	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
L56541	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	I don't want to.
L56540	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
L56501	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
L56500	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
L56499	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
L56498	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
L56497	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
L56480	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
L56479	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
L56478	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
L56477	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
L56476	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	In due time.
L56475	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
L56474	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
L56473	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Yeah. What?
L56472	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
L56471	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
L56470	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
L56469	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
L56468	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
L56380	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
L56379	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	An evil petting zoo?
L56378	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
L56377	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	An evil vet?
L56374	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Not me.
L56373	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
L56093	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
L56092	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
L56091	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Hi.
L56085	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
L56084	u373	m22	NUMBER TWO	Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
L56083	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
L56082	u373	m22	NUMBER TWO	Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
L56081	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
L56080	u373	m22	NUMBER TWO	Umm, that also has already happened.
L56079	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	"People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a ""laser.""  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the ""Ozone Layer."" Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom."
L56078	u373	m22	NUMBER TWO	Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
L56077	u367	m22	DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
L56076	u373	m22	NUMBER TWO	We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
L56179	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	I love you, Vanessa.
L56178	u377	m22	VANESSA	I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
L56177	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
L56174	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
L56173	u377	m22	VANESSA	You didn't answer my question, Mum.
L56172	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
L56171	u377	m22	VANESSA	Did you ever want to?
L56170	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	Of course not. I was married to your father.
L56169	u377	m22	VANESSA	Did you ever...
L56168	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
L56167	u377	m22	VANESSA	I just don't see it.
L56166	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
L56165	u377	m22	VANESSA	What about his teeth?
L56164	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
L56163	u377	m22	VANESSA	Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
L56162	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
L56161	u377	m22	VANESSA	Why?
L56160	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	I'm proud of you.
L56159	u377	m22	VANESSA	Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
L56158	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	You didn't...
L56157	u377	m22	VANESSA	He's asleep.
L56156	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	How's Austin?
L56155	u377	m22	VANESSA	Great.
L56154	u371	m22	MRS. KENSINGTON	Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
L56387	u376	m22	THERAPIST	"OK, Scott, no one really wants to ""kill"" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it."
L56386	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
L56383	u376	m22	THERAPIST	Scott.
L56382	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	No, he's really evil.
L56381	u376	m22	THERAPIST	We don't label people here, Scott.
L56376	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
L56375	u376	m22	THERAPIST	What do you want to do, Scott?
L56372	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	I don't wanna take over the family business.
L56371	u376	m22	THERAPIST	And how do you feel about that?
L56370	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
L56369	u376	m22	THERAPIST	We don't judge here.
L56368	u375	m22	SCOTT EVIL	Well, it's kind of weird.
L56367	u376	m22	THERAPIST	So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
L57766	u387	m23	STEED	No need. I'll call again.
L57765	u378	m23	BAILEY	The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
L57764	u387	m23	STEED	There are limits?
L57763	u378	m23	BAILEY	As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
L57762	u387	m23	STEED	You don't say. How real does it feel?
L57761	u378	m23	BAILEY	Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
L57760	u387	m23	STEED	Seriously?
L57759	u378	m23	BAILEY	Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
L57758	u387	m23	STEED	Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
L57757	u378	m23	BAILEY	Really?
L57756	u387	m23	STEED	Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
L57755	u378	m23	BAILEY	We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
L58080	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
L58079	u380	m23	EMMA	Would that I could say the Same.
L57889	u380	m23	EMMA	So I'm still ...
L57888	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
L57862	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Three days.
L57861	u380	m23	EMMA	How long have I been here?
L57859	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Peter ...
L57858	u380	m23	EMMA	... love ...
L57857	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Fear ...
L57856	u380	m23	EMMA	... love ...
L57855	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Hope...
L57854	u380	m23	EMMA	... love...
L57853	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Secret ...
L57852	u380	m23	EMMA	... preserve...
L57851	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Nature ...
L57850	u380	m23	EMMA	... power ...
L57849	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Flower ...
L57848	u380	m23	EMMA	... death ...
L57847	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Love...
L57846	u380	m23	EMMA	... death ...
L57845	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Black...
L57844	u380	m23	EMMA	Knight ...
L57842	u380	m23	EMMA	... head ...
L57841	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	Red ...
L57840	u380	m23	EMMA	... bottle ...
L57839	u379	m23	DR. DARLING	I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
L57715	u380	m23	EMMA	Sir August...?  What now?
L57714	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
L57650	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	There, look!
L57649	u380	m23	EMMA	Promised? Who promised?
L57648	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
L57644	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	You mean you don't recall??
L57643	u380	m23	EMMA	Have we met?
L57642	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	You
L57641	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
L57640	u380	m23	EMMA	I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
L57639	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
L57638	u380	m23	EMMA	I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
L57504	u380	m23	EMMA	Really -- what happened in 1922?
L57503	u385	m23	PORTER	No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
L57502	u380	m23	EMMA	I have an appointment.
L57501	u385	m23	PORTER	Then you can't come in.
L57500	u380	m23	EMMA	As you see.
L57499	u385	m23	PORTER	You are female?
L57498	u380	m23	EMMA	Impossible?
L57497	u385	m23	PORTER	I'm afraid that's impossible.
L57496	u380	m23	EMMA	Mr. John Steed, please.
L57495	u385	m23	PORTER	May I help you, madam ...
L58072	u389	m23	VOICE	You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
L58071	u380	m23	EMMA	Then who wins?
L58070	u389	m23	VOICE	People, too.
L58069	u380	m23	EMMA	Rules are made to be broken.
L58068	u389	m23	VOICE	Quite right, but we still make the rules.
L58067	u380	m23	EMMA	This isn't a game.
L58066	u389	m23	VOICE	Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
L57818	u389	m23	VOICE	We have met ...
L57817	u380	m23	EMMA	Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
L57816	u389	m23	VOICE	If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
L57815	u380	m23	EMMA	Quite a collection.
L57637	u389	m23	VOICE	Eh? In here!
L57636	u380	m23	EMMA	Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
L58221	u380	m23	EMMA	Thank you, Steed.
L58220	u383	m23	MOTHER	Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
L58217	u380	m23	EMMA	Next assignment?
L58216	u383	m23	MOTHER	About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
L57894	u380	m23	EMMA	So am I.
L57893	u383	m23	MOTHER	The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
L57892	u380	m23	EMMA	To find out who killed my husband.
L57891	u383	m23	MOTHER	This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
L57883	u383	m23	MOTHER	Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
L57882	u380	m23	EMMA	Who?
L57877	u383	m23	MOTHER	A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
L57876	u380	m23	EMMA	The Institute ... the funding ...
L57875	u383	m23	MOTHER	Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
L57873	u380	m23	EMMA	To you ... ?
L57872	u383	m23	MOTHER	The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
L57871	u380	m23	EMMA	I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
L57870	u383	m23	MOTHER	We want to help...!
L57869	u380	m23	EMMA	What are you trying to do to me?
L57867	u380	m23	EMMA	Watch me.
L57866	u383	m23	MOTHER	You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
L57865	u380	m23	EMMA	I resign.
L57752	u380	m23	EMMA	After the cold war ...
L57751	u383	m23	MOTHER	London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
L57749	u380	m23	EMMA	Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
L57748	u383	m23	MOTHER	Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
L57736	u380	m23	EMMA	He tried to warn us ...
L57735	u383	m23	MOTHER	Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
L57565	u380	m23	EMMA	Ropes?
L57564	u383	m23	MOTHER	Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
L57553	u383	m23	MOTHER	Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
L57552	u380	m23	EMMA	How curious ...
L57542	u380	m23	EMMA	Let me guess -- 'Father'?
L57541	u383	m23	MOTHER	My number two. Special assignments. She's --
L57535	u383	m23	MOTHER	Looks like rain, Steed...
L57534	u380	m23	EMMA	Hmmm ...
L57533	u383	m23	MOTHER	Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
L58142	u380	m23	EMMA	I'll never marry you.
L58141	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Choices?
L58140	u380	m23	EMMA	What are my choices?
L58139	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
L58138	u380	m23	EMMA	How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
L58137	u388	m23	VALENTINE	The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
L58136	u388	m23	VALENTINE	One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
L58135	u380	m23	EMMA	Then what's stopping you?
L58134	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
L58133	u380	m23	EMMA	The result would be ...
L58132	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
L58131	u380	m23	EMMA	Such as?
L58123	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
L58122	u380	m23	EMMA	You're mad.
L58121	u388	m23	VALENTINE	That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
L58118	u380	m23	EMMA	Ring?
L58117	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
L58116	u380	m23	EMMA	Valentine, listen to me ...
L58115	u388	m23	VALENTINE	You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
L58113	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
L58112	u380	m23	EMMA	I'm already married ...
L58111	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
L58108	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
L58107	u380	m23	EMMA	'Our revels now are ended.'
L58106	u388	m23	VALENTINE	You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
L58105	u380	m23	EMMA	But -- why?
L58104	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Of course. I planned that, too.
L58103	u380	m23	EMMA	But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
L58102	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
L58101	u380	m23	EMMA	Too many cooks --
L58100	u388	m23	VALENTINE	For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
L58099	u380	m23	EMMA	You killed my husband.
L58098	u388	m23	VALENTINE	An unholy trinity ...
L58097	u380	m23	EMMA	Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
L58096	u388	m23	VALENTINE	A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
L58093	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
L58092	u380	m23	EMMA	You.
L57465	u380	m23	EMMA	Thanks, Valentine ...
L57464	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
L58219	u387	m23	STEED	Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
L58218	u380	m23	EMMA	Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
L58214	u380	m23	EMMA	Pity your mother came, too ...
L58213	u387	m23	STEED	Our chaperon.
L58212	u387	m23	STEED	Not quite.
L58211	u380	m23	EMMA	Our little paradise -- just made for two?
L58210	u387	m23	STEED	It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
L58209	u380	m23	EMMA	I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
L58208	u387	m23	STEED	As a matter of fact I have ...
L58207	u380	m23	EMMA	Have you any place in mind?
L58206	u387	m23	STEED	English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
L58205	u380	m23	EMMA	Still a bit chilly ...
L58204	u387	m23	STEED	A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
L58203	u380	m23	EMMA	'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
L58202	u387	m23	STEED	'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
L58200	u387	m23	STEED	The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
L58199	u380	m23	EMMA	What kept you?
L58198	u387	m23	STEED	Mrs. Peel?
L58038	u380	m23	EMMA	If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
L58037	u387	m23	STEED	Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
L58036	u380	m23	EMMA	But --
L58035	u387	m23	STEED	No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
L58034	u380	m23	EMMA	You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
L58033	u387	m23	STEED	Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
L58032	u380	m23	EMMA	Where are you going?
L58031	u387	m23	STEED	I'll be back ...
L58016	u380	m23	EMMA	Have a look at this.
L58015	u387	m23	STEED	Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
L58008	u380	m23	EMMA	'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
L58007	u387	m23	STEED	They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
L58006	u387	m23	STEED	Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
L58005	u380	m23	EMMA	Trubshaw again? What now?
L58002	u380	m23	EMMA	Shall we?
L58001	u387	m23	STEED	You first.
L58000	u380	m23	EMMA	When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
L57999	u387	m23	STEED	Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
L57998	u380	m23	EMMA	What is it?
L57997	u387	m23	STEED	Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
L57996	u380	m23	EMMA	It's called Black Leather.
L57995	u387	m23	STEED	What's that you're wearing?
L57987	u380	m23	EMMA	Have we been invited?
L57986	u387	m23	STEED	There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
L57981	u387	m23	STEED	You didn't tell her?
L57980	u380	m23	EMMA	Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
L57979	u387	m23	STEED	We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
L57962	u387	m23	STEED	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
L57961	u380	m23	EMMA	Aren't you coming?
L57960	u387	m23	STEED	You'll find out.
L57959	u380	m23	EMMA	Why's he called 'Invisible'?
L57958	u387	m23	STEED	His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
L57957	u380	m23	EMMA	I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
L57956	u387	m23	STEED	Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
L57955	u380	m23	EMMA	Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
L57954	u387	m23	STEED	Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
L57953	u380	m23	EMMA	... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
L57952	u387	m23	STEED	Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
L57951	u380	m23	EMMA	No idea who. No idea why ...
L57950	u387	m23	STEED	Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
L57948	u387	m23	STEED	I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
L57947	u380	m23	EMMA	You lied.
L57946	u387	m23	STEED	I told Mother I took care of you.
L57937	u380	m23	EMMA	As far as you trust me.
L57936	u387	m23	STEED	You don't trust me?
L57935	u380	m23	EMMA	No, after you.
L57934	u387	m23	STEED	After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
L57933	u380	m23	EMMA	Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
L57932	u387	m23	STEED	Winning isn't everything.
L57931	u380	m23	EMMA	I'm playing to win.
L57930	u387	m23	STEED	I thought you didn't.
L57929	u380	m23	EMMA	I thought you played by the rules.
L57928	u387	m23	STEED	Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
L57927	u380	m23	EMMA	You're playing games.
L57926	u387	m23	STEED	Not for a moment.
L57925	u380	m23	EMMA	But you did suspect me.
L57923	u380	m23	EMMA	Is that all?
L57922	u387	m23	STEED	Keeping a stiff upper lip?
L57921	u380	m23	EMMA	Mmm ... what are you doing?
L57915	u380	m23	EMMA	It wasn't me; you have my word.
L57914	u387	m23	STEED	I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
L57913	u380	m23	EMMA	And do you trust me?
L57912	u387	m23	STEED	... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
L57911	u380	m23	EMMA	Yes ... ?
L57910	u387	m23	STEED	Always.  Except ...
L57909	u380	m23	EMMA	Because you always obey orders ...
L57908	u387	m23	STEED	No trouble.
L57907	u380	m23	EMMA	I could save you the trouble.
L57904	u387	m23	STEED	Nothing personal.
L57903	u380	m23	EMMA	To kill me?
L57902	u387	m23	STEED	Orders.
L57901	u380	m23	EMMA	You followed me.
L57836	u380	m23	EMMA	It was Peter -- I saw him ...
L57835	u387	m23	STEED	I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
L57834	u380	m23	EMMA	Was I?
L57833	u387	m23	STEED	The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
L57832	u380	m23	EMMA	Where am I?
L57808	u387	m23	STEED	Mrs. Peel ... ?
L57807	u380	m23	EMMA	Steed ... !
L57799	u387	m23	STEED	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
L57798	u380	m23	EMMA	Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
L57797	u387	m23	STEED	Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
L57796	u380	m23	EMMA	This must be the last straw.
L57795	u387	m23	STEED	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
L57794	u380	m23	EMMA	Barely.
L57793	u387	m23	STEED	What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
L57778	u380	m23	EMMA	Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
L57777	u387	m23	STEED	Do you always drive this fast?
L57776	u387	m23	STEED	Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
L57775	u380	m23	EMMA	Is that what you think?
L57774	u387	m23	STEED	According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
L57773	u380	m23	EMMA	Not that I know of.  Explanation?
L57772	u387	m23	STEED	... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
L57771	u380	m23	EMMA	Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
L57770	u387	m23	STEED	... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
L57769	u380	m23	EMMA	Three agents killed by bad weather...
L57747	u387	m23	STEED	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
L57746	u380	m23	EMMA	That's what we were working on.
L57745	u387	m23	STEED	But if someone miniaturized the process...
L57744	u380	m23	EMMA	Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
L57743	u387	m23	STEED	Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
L57742	u380	m23	EMMA	The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
L57741	u387	m23	STEED	Is there anything that isn't?
L57740	u380	m23	EMMA	Not quite. This is my field.
L57733	u387	m23	STEED	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
L57732	u380	m23	EMMA	But
L57713	u380	m23	EMMA	Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
L57712	u387	m23	STEED	For you, Mrs. Peel.
L57701	u380	m23	EMMA	She had this in her mouth. There, there...
L57700	u387	m23	STEED	Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
L57699	u380	m23	EMMA	Is that written in his shoe?
L57698	u387	m23	STEED	Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
L57697	u380	m23	EMMA	Any ideas?
L57696	u387	m23	STEED	What on earth?
L57694	u380	m23	EMMA	Very good, Steed ...
L57693	u387	m23	STEED	Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
L57692	u380	m23	EMMA	How on earth can you tell?
L57691	u387	m23	STEED	Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
L57678	u380	m23	EMMA	I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
L57677	u387	m23	STEED	Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
L57676	u380	m23	EMMA	You mean my other self ...
L57675	u387	m23	STEED	I must say, you look more your old self --
L57674	u380	m23	EMMA	Did you say formal? I must dress.
L57673	u387	m23	STEED	An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
L57672	u380	m23	EMMA	No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
L57671	u387	m23	STEED	Did he say who?
L57670	u380	m23	EMMA	That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
L57669	u387	m23	STEED	Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
L57668	u380	m23	EMMA	But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
L57667	u387	m23	STEED	Frankly that's how I remember it.
L57666	u380	m23	EMMA	You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
L57665	u387	m23	STEED	Why should they think that?
L57664	u380	m23	EMMA	Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
L57663	u387	m23	STEED	I might say the same.
L57662	u380	m23	EMMA	I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
L57661	u387	m23	STEED	I wasn't about to.
L57660	u380	m23	EMMA	You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
L57659	u387	m23	STEED	Strange.
L57658	u380	m23	EMMA	You should be dead.  How do you feel?
L57657	u387	m23	STEED	Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
L57632	u387	m23	STEED	Small talk.  Try the weather.
L57631	u380	m23	EMMA	So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
L57630	u387	m23	STEED	All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
L57629	u380	m23	EMMA	Any other vices?
L57628	u387	m23	STEED	The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
L57627	u380	m23	EMMA	June, July ... August?
L57626	u387	m23	STEED	Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
L57625	u380	m23	EMMA	An eccentric recluse?
L57624	u387	m23	STEED	According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
L57623	u387	m23	STEED	I meant me.
L57622	u380	m23	EMMA	No thanks.
L57621	u387	m23	STEED	After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
L57620	u380	m23	EMMA	I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
L57619	u387	m23	STEED	They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
L57618	u380	m23	EMMA	Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
L57617	u387	m23	STEED	For a man in my position --
L57616	u380	m23	EMMA	Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
L57615	u387	m23	STEED	As per mother's instructions.
L57614	u380	m23	EMMA	Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
L57612	u380	m23	EMMA	That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
L57611	u387	m23	STEED	The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
L57610	u380	m23	EMMA	And I suppose you're the knight.
L57609	u387	m23	STEED	A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
L57608	u380	m23	EMMA	But why? What's the point?
L57607	u387	m23	STEED	Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
L57606	u380	m23	EMMA	You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
L57603	u387	m23	STEED	Do you really think so?
L57602	u380	m23	EMMA	That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
L57601	u387	m23	STEED	Thank you, Trubshaw ...
L57600	u380	m23	EMMA	You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
L57599	u387	m23	STEED	Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
L57598	u380	m23	EMMA	Steed, we really must be --
L57595	u380	m23	EMMA	Or half cocked.
L57594	u387	m23	STEED	Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
L57593	u380	m23	EMMA	I thought we were on our way.
L57592	u387	m23	STEED	Yes indeed. I need protection.
L57591	u380	m23	EMMA	Do you?
L57589	u380	m23	EMMA	I had a feeling you would. Touche!
L57588	u387	m23	STEED	Really?  I fail to see the connection.
L57587	u380	m23	EMMA	My father always wanted a boy.
L57548	u380	m23	EMMA	A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
L57547	u387	m23	STEED	Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
L57537	u380	m23	EMMA	We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
L57536	u387	m23	STEED	... Showers followed by sunny periods.
L57525	u380	m23	EMMA	Mother?
L57524	u387	m23	STEED	I didn't. Mother did.
L57523	u380	m23	EMMA	And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
L57522	u387	m23	STEED	Much better.
L57521	u380	m23	EMMA	Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
L57520	u387	m23	STEED	I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
L57519	u380	m23	EMMA	And just what is the game?
L57518	u387	m23	STEED	Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
L57517	u380	m23	EMMA	Rules are made to be broken.
L57516	u387	m23	STEED	Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
L57515	u380	m23	EMMA	Whereas you are.
L57514	u387	m23	STEED	Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
L57513	u380	m23	EMMA	So what was all this -- some sort of test?
L57512	u387	m23	STEED	Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
L57511	u380	m23	EMMA	1922. Why the kippers?
L57510	u387	m23	STEED	I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
L57509	u380	m23	EMMA	I had a spot of bother at the door.
L57508	u387	m23	STEED	I was about to throw in the towel.
L57507	u380	m23	EMMA	And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
L57506	u387	m23	STEED	Doctor Peel, I presume?
L58076	u381	m23	FATHER	And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
L58075	u380	m23	EMMA	Decontamination -- ?
L58074	u381	m23	FATHER	Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
L57731	u381	m23	FATHER	It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
L57730	u380	m23	EMMA	You don't believe him?
L57726	u381	m23	FATHER	Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
L57725	u380	m23	EMMA	Where's Mother?
L57563	u380	m23	EMMA	You're saying I have no choice.
L57562	u381	m23	FATHER	Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
L57555	u380	m23	EMMA	I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
L57554	u381	m23	FATHER	Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
L58054	u380	m23	EMMA	I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
L58053	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	You're not venturing alone, surely.
L58052	u380	m23	EMMA	I shall need a small plane.
L58051	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
L58050	u380	m23	EMMA	Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
L58049	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Privately owned by ...
L58048	u380	m23	EMMA	... and now?
L58047	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
L57989	u380	m23	EMMA	Well, I can't possibly go like this.
L57988	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
L57985	u380	m23	EMMA	I fail to see --
L57984	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
L57983	u380	m23	EMMA	Getting to what?
L57982	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	I was getting to it.
L57978	u380	m23	EMMA	Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
L57977	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Makes two of us.
L57976	u380	m23	EMMA	Who's now vanished.
L57975	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
L57974	u380	m23	EMMA	Surveillance? By whom?
L57973	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
L57972	u380	m23	EMMA	I know all this.
L57971	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
L57970	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Half-brother to be precise.
L57969	u380	m23	EMMA	Peter's brother?  But --
L57968	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
L57966	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
L57965	u380	m23	EMMA	I see.
L57964	u382	m23	INVISIBLE JONES	Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
L58129	u387	m23	STEED	Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
L58128	u381	m23	FATHER	Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
L58127	u387	m23	STEED	It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
L58126	u381	m23	FATHER	You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
L58125	u387	m23	STEED	How did you guess?
L58124	u381	m23	FATHER	Steed
L58011	u387	m23	STEED	Dead, I'm afraid.
L58010	u381	m23	FATHER	We want Mrs. Peel.
L58009	u387	m23	STEED	Oh, hello ...
L57729	u381	m23	FATHER	So you say ...
L57728	u387	m23	STEED	We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
L57551	u381	m23	FATHER	Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
L57550	u387	m23	STEED	Global warming?
L57549	u381	m23	FATHER	A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
L58064	u383	m23	MOTHER	I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
L58063	u387	m23	STEED	In your operation.
L58062	u383	m23	MOTHER	Where?
L58061	u387	m23	STEED	I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
L58060	u383	m23	MOTHER	You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
L58059	u387	m23	STEED	I was hoping you could tell me.
L57898	u383	m23	MOTHER	Mother and Father know best.
L57897	u387	m23	STEED	Guilty until proven innocent?
L57896	u383	m23	MOTHER	Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
L57885	u383	m23	MOTHER	Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
L57884	u387	m23	STEED	You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
L57838	u387	m23	STEED	No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
L57837	u383	m23	MOTHER	This man -- did you see him?
L57739	u387	m23	STEED	Impossible.
L57738	u383	m23	MOTHER	Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
L57737	u387	m23	STEED	We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
L57583	u383	m23	MOTHER	You.
L57582	u387	m23	STEED	Anyone particular in mind?
L57581	u383	m23	MOTHER	Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
L57578	u387	m23	STEED	How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
L57577	u383	m23	MOTHER	Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
L57573	u383	m23	MOTHER	She may try to kill you.
L57572	u387	m23	STEED	Why?
L57571	u383	m23	MOTHER	Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
L57570	u387	m23	STEED	Insane ... ?
L57569	u383	m23	MOTHER	Possibly. Split personality ...
L57568	u387	m23	STEED	Amnesia?
L57567	u383	m23	MOTHER	She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
L57566	u387	m23	STEED	Think she really killed those agents?
L57557	u387	m23	STEED	Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
L57556	u383	m23	MOTHER	Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
L57488	u383	m23	MOTHER	Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
L57487	u387	m23	STEED	You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
L57486	u383	m23	MOTHER	Weather's turning nasty.
L57483	u383	m23	MOTHER	Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
L57482	u387	m23	STEED	Mother. I thought you were burglars.
L57802	u384	m23	OLD LADY	This way ...
L57801	u387	m23	STEED	Wonderland Weather Ltd.
L57792	u387	m23	STEED	You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
L57791	u384	m23	OLD LADY	Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
L57790	u387	m23	STEED	Both, actually.
L57789	u384	m23	OLD LADY	You with Mother or Father?
L57788	u387	m23	STEED	She was ...
L57787	u384	m23	OLD LADY	I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
L57786	u387	m23	STEED	I feel sure of it.
L57785	u384	m23	OLD LADY	Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
L57782	u387	m23	STEED	I think so, thank you so much ...
L57781	u384	m23	OLD LADY	Are you alright, young man?
L57722	u389	m23	VOICE	Stay by the window. By the window.
L57721	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	Let it be rain, please let it be --
L57720	u389	m23	VOICE	Walk over to the window ...
L57719	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	No, please! I beg you ...
L57718	u389	m23	VOICE	Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
L57717	u386	m23	SIR AUGUST	Mrs. Peel -- ?
L58194	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Ugh ...
L58193	u387	m23	STEED	I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
L58191	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
L58190	u387	m23	STEED	You are, and it's behind you.
L58189	u388	m23	VALENTINE	Aren't you forgetting about something?
L58182	u387	m23	STEED	Did I? My mistake.
L58181	u388	m23	VALENTINE	You said ... one shot.
L58180	u387	m23	STEED	I do.
L58179	u388	m23	VALENTINE	If you say so.
L58178	u387	m23	STEED	Rules are made to be broken.
L58177	u388	m23	VALENTINE	That's not playing by the rules.
L58176	u387	m23	STEED	One shot -- for emergencies.
L58175	u388	m23	VALENTINE	You wish.
L58174	u387	m23	STEED	Bang-bang ... you're dead.
L58173	u388	m23	VALENTINE	But did they teach you this?
L58172	u387	m23	STEED	I was at Harrow ...
L58171	u388	m23	VALENTINE	You're better than I expected.
L58168	u387	m23	STEED	Perish the thought.
L58167	u388	m23	VALENTINE	The last one you'll ever see.
L58166	u387	m23	STEED	Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
L58165	u388	m23	VALENTINE	John Steed.
L84067	u488	m30	AMOS	Good luck, kid.
L84066	u492	m30	EDWARD	Thank you.
L84065	u488	m30	AMOS	Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
L84064	u492	m30	EDWARD	There's only one I want.
L84063	u488	m30	AMOS	I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
L84062	u488	m30	AMOS	That would explain the indigestion.
L84061	u492	m30	EDWARD	A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
L84060	u488	m30	AMOS	Didn't kill anything, did I?
L84045	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
L84044	u488	m30	AMOS	Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
L84043	u492	m30	EDWARD	I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
L84041	u488	m30	AMOS	Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
L84040	u492	m30	EDWARD	Someone stole my backpack.
L84039	u492	m30	EDWARD	I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
L84038	u488	m30	AMOS	Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
L84037	u492	m30	EDWARD	What do you mean? You don't even know me.
L84036	u488	m30	AMOS	Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
L84035	u492	m30	EDWARD	Who is she? Where does she live?
L84034	u488	m30	AMOS	I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
L84033	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yes!
L84032	u488	m30	AMOS	Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
L84031	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
L84030	u488	m30	AMOS	Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
L84029	u492	m30	EDWARD	I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
L84028	u488	m30	AMOS	See! The big guy likes it.
L84024	u492	m30	EDWARD	That's great.
L84023	u488	m30	AMOS	Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
L84021	u492	m30	EDWARD	It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
L84020	u488	m30	AMOS	Great, great. That's fantastic.
L83943	u492	m30	EDWARD	I don't expect to.
L83942	u489	m30	BEAMEN	You won't find a better place!
L83939	u489	m30	BEAMEN	No one's ever left.
L83938	u492	m30	EDWARD	This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
L83937	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Why?
L83936	u492	m30	EDWARD	I have to leave. Tonight.
L83899	u492	m30	EDWARD	It truly is.
L83898	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
L83896	u492	m30	EDWARD	No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
L83895	u489	m30	BEAMEN	He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
L83894	u492	m30	EDWARD	The poet? What ever happened to him?
L83893	u489	m30	BEAMEN	The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
L83892	u492	m30	EDWARD	What is this place?
L83886	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Not yet.
L83885	u492	m30	EDWARD	You were expecting me?
L83884	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
L83883	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yes.
L83882	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Bloom like a flower?
L83881	u492	m30	EDWARD	Edward Bloom.
L83880	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Welcome to ya. What's your name?
L84093	u492	m30	EDWARD	I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
L84092	u490	m30	DON PRICE	What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
L84091	u492	m30	EDWARD	Don.
L84090	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Bloom!
L83739	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Let's see it.
L83738	u492	m30	EDWARD	I brought it.
L83737	u490	m30	DON PRICE	You get the eye?
L83733	u492	m30	EDWARD	Fine, I'm doing it.
L83732	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Fine, you do it.
L83731	u492	m30	EDWARD	Fine, I will.
L83730	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Then do it.
L83729	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
L83728	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Or are you too scared?
L84364	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
L84363	u498	m30	WILL	No.
L84362	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
L84361	u498	m30	WILL	A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
L84360	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
L84359	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
L84358	u498	m30	WILL	How would you describe him?
L84357	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Thirty years. Maybe more.
L84356	u498	m30	WILL	How long have you known my father?
L84355	u498	m30	WILL	My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
L84354	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
L83774	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
L83773	u498	m30	WILL	Can I see him?
L83767	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	A pleasure.
L83766	u498	m30	WILL	Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
L83765	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Will.
L84318	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
L84317	u493	m30	JENNY	Lucky girl.
L84316	u492	m30	EDWARD	And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
L84315	u493	m30	JENNY	I know.
L84314	u492	m30	EDWARD	Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
L84307	u493	m30	JENNY	Go.
L84306	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll...
L84305	u493	m30	JENNY	Please. Go. Just go.
L84304	u492	m30	EDWARD	Lord, I'm sorry I...
L84303	u492	m30	EDWARD	I can get it. I can just...
L84302	u493	m30	JENNY	It's okay, just leave it.
L84300	u492	m30	EDWARD	I see. I thank you for your time.
L84299	u493	m30	JENNY	I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
L84298	u493	m30	JENNY	I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
L84297	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
L84295	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
L84294	u493	m30	JENNY	I'm not convinced you should be happy.
L84293	u492	m30	EDWARD	Helping people makes me happy.
L84291	u492	m30	EDWARD	It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
L84290	u493	m30	JENNY	Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
L84289	u492	m30	EDWARD	In so many words, yes.
L84287	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
L84286	u493	m30	JENNY	So I've heard.
L84285	u492	m30	EDWARD	Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
L84284	u493	m30	JENNY	No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
L84283	u492	m30	EDWARD	How did you know?
L84282	u493	m30	JENNY	You must be Edward Bloom.
L83945	u492	m30	EDWARD	I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
L83944	u493	m30	JENNY	Promise me you'll come back.
L83941	u492	m30	EDWARD	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
L83940	u493	m30	JENNY	How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
L83931	u493	m30	JENNY	And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
L83930	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're pretty good at arithmetic.
L83929	u493	m30	JENNY	I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
L83928	u492	m30	EDWARD	Eighteen.
L83927	u493	m30	JENNY	How old are you?
L83924	u493	m30	JENNY	It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
L83923	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yeah.
L83922	u493	m30	JENNY	Was she nekkid?
L83921	u492	m30	EDWARD	Well, she... uh...
L83920	u493	m30	JENNY	What did she look like?
L83919	u492	m30	EDWARD	Did you see that woman?
L84115	u492	m30	EDWARD	And I like you.
L84114	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I like your stories.
L84113	u492	m30	EDWARD	I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
L84112	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You were talking about your wedding.
L84111	u492	m30	EDWARD	There was one time when I was eleven...
L84110	u492	m30	EDWARD	Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
L84109	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
L84108	u492	m30	EDWARD	Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
L84107	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
L84011	u492	m30	EDWARD	Well, it's not a short one.
L84010	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Oh, so this is a tall tale?
L84009	u492	m30	EDWARD	Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
L84008	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I never knew.
L84007	u492	m30	EDWARD	That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
L84004	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Please?
L84003	u492	m30	EDWARD	You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
L84002	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Can I take your picture?
L84001	u492	m30	EDWARD	Spooning the sherbet.
L83999	u492	m30	EDWARD	They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
L83998	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Stop.
L83997	u492	m30	EDWARD	He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
L83995	u492	m30	EDWARD	He was slipping her a little extra cream.
L83994	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	No, I understand.
L83993	u492	m30	EDWARD	Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
L83991	u492	m30	EDWARD	"Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, ""Your Grampa is going to die."" Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead."
L83990	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	That's terrible.
L83989	u492	m30	EDWARD	"Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, ""Your Aunt is going to die."" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead."
L83987	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	What were you dreaming about?
L83986	u492	m30	EDWARD	I was dreaming.
L83985	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Hi. How are you feeling?
L83958	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
L83957	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Really.
L83875	u492	m30	EDWARD	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
L83874	u495	m30	KARL	You're not trying to run away?
L83873	u492	m30	EDWARD	That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
L83872	u495	m30	KARL	You know anyone's who's taken it?
L83869	u492	m30	EDWARD	Beats me.
L83868	u495	m30	KARL	What did she say?
L83860	u492	m30	EDWARD	Okay.
L83859	u495	m30	KARL	Okay.
L83858	u492	m30	EDWARD	I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
L83857	u495	m30	KARL	You don't like it?
L83856	u492	m30	EDWARD	Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
L83855	u495	m30	KARL	Karl.
L83854	u492	m30	EDWARD	What's your name, Giant?
L83853	u495	m30	KARL	You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
L83852	u492	m30	EDWARD	So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
L83851	u495	m30	KARL	I can.
L83850	u492	m30	EDWARD	Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
L83849	u495	m30	KARL	Really?
L83848	u492	m30	EDWARD	Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
L84408	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yes. Exactly.
L84407	u498	m30	WILL	You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
L84402	u492	m30	EDWARD	Story of my life.
L84401	u498	m30	WILL	It's unbelievable.
L84398	u492	m30	EDWARD	The River!
L84397	u498	m30	WILL	You say...
L84396	u498	m30	WILL	Where are we headed?
L84383	u498	m30	WILL	Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
L84382	u492	m30	EDWARD	Let's get out of here.
L84378	u498	m30	WILL	Okay. Okay.
L84377	u492	m30	EDWARD	Like this.
L84376	u498	m30	WILL	I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
L84373	u492	m30	EDWARD	How I go.
L84372	u498	m30	WILL	How what happens?
L84371	u492	m30	EDWARD	Tell me how it happens.
L84370	u498	m30	WILL	The river?
L84369	u492	m30	EDWARD	The river.
L84193	u492	m30	EDWARD	I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
L84192	u498	m30	WILL	Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
L84191	u492	m30	EDWARD	What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
L84190	u492	m30	EDWARD	It would kill you, huh?
L84189	u498	m30	WILL	Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
L84188	u498	m30	WILL	Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
L84187	u492	m30	EDWARD	You think I'm fake.
L84186	u498	m30	WILL	You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
L84185	u492	m30	EDWARD	I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
L84184	u498	m30	WILL	I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
L84183	u492	m30	EDWARD	What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
L84182	u498	m30	WILL	The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
L84181	u492	m30	EDWARD	"Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is..."""
L84180	u498	m30	WILL	I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
L84179	u492	m30	EDWARD	What?
L84178	u498	m30	WILL	Dad!
L84177	u492	m30	EDWARD	Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
L84176	u498	m30	WILL	Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
L84173	u498	m30	WILL	Can we talk?
L84172	u492	m30	EDWARD	Son?
L84171	u498	m30	WILL	Dad?
L84170	u492	m30	EDWARD	But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
L84168	u492	m30	EDWARD	I think someone hasn't.
L84167	u498	m30	WILL	The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
L84166	u498	m30	WILL	Yes.
L84165	u492	m30	EDWARD	Did I ever tell you about how...
L83962	u492	m30	EDWARD	Oh, so you know.
L83961	u498	m30	WILL	Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
L83960	u492	m30	EDWARD	It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
L83959	u498	m30	WILL	Why not religion, Dad?
L83814	u492	m30	EDWARD	I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
L83813	u498	m30	WILL	I thought you weren't dying.
L83811	u498	m30	WILL	I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
L83810	u492	m30	EDWARD	You know where the chemicals are?
L83809	u498	m30	WILL	I will.
L83808	u492	m30	EDWARD	Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
L83807	u498	m30	WILL	I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
L83806	u492	m30	EDWARD	You mean, while I'm here.
L83805	u498	m30	WILL	Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
L83803	u498	m30	WILL	You're right.
L83802	u492	m30	EDWARD	There's a lot you don't know about me.
L83801	u498	m30	WILL	When did you ever work in an office?
L83800	u492	m30	EDWARD	True story.
L83799	u498	m30	WILL	Really.
L83798	u492	m30	EDWARD	You owe me three-fifty.
L83797	u498	m30	WILL	What did he say?
L83796	u492	m30	EDWARD	And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
L83795	u498	m30	WILL	Okay.
L83794	u492	m30	EDWARD	There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
L83793	u492	m30	EDWARD	Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
L83792	u498	m30	WILL	So how does it happen?
L83791	u492	m30	EDWARD	I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
L83790	u498	m30	WILL	No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
L83789	u492	m30	EDWARD	She was a witch.
L83788	u498	m30	WILL	The Old Lady by the swamp.
L83787	u492	m30	EDWARD	Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
L83786	u498	m30	WILL	Really.
L83785	u492	m30	EDWARD	People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
L83783	u492	m30	EDWARD	You learned from the best.
L83782	u498	m30	WILL	You think I'm up for it?
L83781	u492	m30	EDWARD	No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
L83780	u498	m30	WILL	Did you do any of that?
L83779	u492	m30	EDWARD	Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
L83778	u498	m30	WILL	Am I?
L83777	u492	m30	EDWARD	You --  -- are in for a surprise.
L83705	u498	m30	WILL	I'm not scared.
L83704	u492	m30	EDWARD	Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
L83703	u498	m30	WILL	The one about the witch.
L83675	u498	m30	WILL	No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
L83674	u492	m30	EDWARD	Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
L83673	u498	m30	WILL	Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
L83672	u492	m30	EDWARD	Jesus Christ.
L83671	u498	m30	WILL	I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
L83670	u492	m30	EDWARD	What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
L83659	u498	m30	WILL	Make him stop.
L83658	u492	m30	EDWARD	You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
L84239	u497	m30	SANDRA	I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
L84238	u492	m30	EDWARD	I was drying out.
L84104	u492	m30	EDWARD	Go out with me.
L84103	u497	m30	SANDRA	How can I convince you to stop?
L84086	u492	m30	EDWARD	I have the rest of my life to find out.
L84085	u497	m30	SANDRA	You don't even know me.
L84084	u492	m30	EDWARD	I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
L84083	u497	m30	SANDRA	How did you get so many?
L84082	u492	m30	EDWARD	They're your favorite flower.
L84081	u497	m30	SANDRA	Daffodils?
L84074	u497	m30	SANDRA	But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
L84073	u492	m30	EDWARD	Oh.
L84071	u492	m30	EDWARD	Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
L84070	u497	m30	SANDRA	I'm sorry.
L84229	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
L84228	u492	m30	EDWARD	'Fraid so.
L84227	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	This is it? The whole vault.
L84218	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I'm robbing this place.
L84217	u492	m30	EDWARD	So what are you up to now?
L84216	u492	m30	EDWARD	That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
L84215	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
L84214	u492	m30	EDWARD	I don't believe it!
L84213	u492	m30	EDWARD	I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
L84212	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	It's me. Norther Winslow.
L83915	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
L83914	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I can't imagine any place better than here.
L83913	u492	m30	EDWARD	Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
L83912	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	This is why you don't show work in progress.
L83910	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
L83909	u492	m30	EDWARD	Really.
L83908	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
L83903	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	There is no softer ground than town.
L83902	u492	m30	EDWARD	Wait! I need those!
L84326	u493	m30	JENNY	Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
L84325	u498	m30	WILL	You didn't become crazy.
L84324	u493	m30	JENNY	No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
L84323	u498	m30	WILL	Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
L84267	u498	m30	WILL	My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
L84266	u493	m30	JENNY	Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
L84265	u498	m30	WILL	Because he's dying.
L84264	u493	m30	JENNY	Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
L84263	u498	m30	WILL	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
L84262	u493	m30	JENNY	Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
L84261	u498	m30	WILL	Were you and my father having an affair?
L84260	u493	m30	JENNY	This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
L84259	u498	m30	WILL	How did you know my father?
L84255	u493	m30	JENNY	I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
L84254	u498	m30	WILL	Are you Jenny Hill?
L84253	u493	m30	JENNY	I wasn't expecting you.
L84252	u498	m30	WILL	Hello.
L84251	u493	m30	JENNY	Oh. Oh.
L84351	u497	m30	SANDRA	I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
L84350	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I do.
L84349	u497	m30	SANDRA	Do you like it, being pregnant?
L84348	u497	m30	SANDRA	I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
L84347	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
L84200	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I need to lie down for a bit.
L84199	u497	m30	SANDRA	I'm going to check on him.
L84175	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'll help you.
L84174	u497	m30	SANDRA	I'm going to get started on dishes.
L83955	u497	m30	SANDRA	We'll have to pick up a copy.
L83954	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
L83758	u497	m30	SANDRA	Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
L83757	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Yes.
L83756	u497	m30	SANDRA	Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
L84336	u498	m30	WILL	Is he going to be okay?
L84335	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
L84334	u498	m30	WILL	What happened?
L84164	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
L84163	u498	m30	WILL	I need you on my side.
L84162	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You're not.
L84161	u498	m30	WILL	Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
L84160	u498	m30	WILL	"What is ""true?"" I've never heard my father say a single true thing."
L84159	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	But it's not true.
L84158	u498	m30	WILL	You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
L84157	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Do you love him?
L84156	u498	m30	WILL	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
L84155	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Do you love your father?
L84154	u498	m30	WILL	Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
L84153	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Mmm, what?
L84152	u498	m30	WILL	Mmm.
L84151	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	But it's romantic.
L84150	u498	m30	WILL	That's because most of it never happened.
L84149	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
L84148	u498	m30	WILL	They met at Auburn.
L84147	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You never told me how your parents met.
L84146	u498	m30	WILL	Did you?
L84145	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I talked with your father last night.
L83701	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'm going with you.
L83700	u498	m30	WILL	You don't have to.
L83699	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'm going with you.
L83698	u498	m30	WILL	Probably tonight.
L83697	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You need to go.
L83696	u498	m30	WILL	It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
L83695	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	It's bad.
L84346	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes. Thank you.
L84345	u498	m30	WILL	Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
L84341	u497	m30	SANDRA	That's okay?
L84340	u498	m30	WILL	I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
L84339	u497	m30	SANDRA	I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
L84249	u497	m30	SANDRA	Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
L84248	u498	m30	WILL	So you never bought any land.
L84247	u497	m30	SANDRA	I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
L84246	u498	m30	WILL	Did you and Dad have any other property?
L84245	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes?
L84244	u498	m30	WILL	Mom?
L84243	u497	m30	SANDRA	He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
L84242	u498	m30	WILL	Is he awake?
L84198	u497	m30	SANDRA	Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
L84197	u498	m30	WILL	That really happened?
L83982	u497	m30	SANDRA	Do you know who that is?
L83981	u498	m30	WILL	No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
L83980	u497	m30	SANDRA	Was she one of your teachers?
L83979	u498	m30	WILL	Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
L83978	u497	m30	SANDRA	Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
L83977	u497	m30	SANDRA	Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
L83976	u498	m30	WILL	But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
L83975	u497	m30	SANDRA	I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
L83974	u498	m30	WILL	True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
L83973	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
L83972	u498	m30	WILL	Josephine and I have a lot in common.
L83971	u497	m30	SANDRA	No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
L83970	u498	m30	WILL	Yes. But that's a different...
L83969	u497	m30	SANDRA	Would you say you understand Josephine?
L83968	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
L83967	u498	m30	WILL	How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
L83966	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes.
L83965	u498	m30	WILL	What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
L83964	u497	m30	SANDRA	Of course.
L83963	u498	m30	WILL	Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
L83953	u497	m30	SANDRA	Really! That's wonderful.
L83952	u498	m30	WILL	I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
L83764	u497	m30	SANDRA	You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
L83763	u498	m30	WILL	How much time does he have left?
L83762	u497	m30	SANDRA	He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
L83761	u498	m30	WILL	How is he?
L83760	u497	m30	SANDRA	He's up with your father.
L83759	u498	m30	WILL	Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
L83751	u497	m30	SANDRA	You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
L83750	u498	m30	WILL	We rented a car.
L83749	u497	m30	SANDRA	Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
L83748	u498	m30	WILL	We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
L83747	u497	m30	SANDRA	How did you get here?
L108448	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Bourne comes here? Why?
L108447	u612	m39	ABBOTT	He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
L108446	u615	m39	GRETKOV	What?
L108445	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Save it for Bourne.
L108444	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
L108443	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What do you mean?
L108442	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
L108381	u615	m39	GRETKOV	One last push. One.
L108380	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
L108378	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Anything else?
L108377	u612	m39	ABBOTT	She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
L108376	u615	m39	GRETKOV	And the Landy woman?
L108375	u612	m39	ABBOTT	No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
L108374	u615	m39	GRETKOV	Will it track back to us?
L108373	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
L108372	u615	m39	GRETKOV	There was a mistake.
L108371	u612	m39	ABBOTT	You told me Bourne was dead.
L108465	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
L108464	u623	m39	PAMELA	No. You lost your way.
L108463	u612	m39	ABBOTT	In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
L108462	u623	m39	PAMELA	No good options left?
L108461	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Had to be done.
L108460	u623	m39	PAMELA	And Danny Zorn, what was that?
L108459	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Why not? It was just money.
L108458	u623	m39	PAMELA	And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
L108457	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
L108456	u623	m39	PAMELA	'Why' would be enough for me.
L108455	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
L108454	u623	m39	PAMELA	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
L108453	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Sit down.
L108435	u623	m39	PAMELA	I'm sorry, Ward.
L108434	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
L108433	u623	m39	PAMELA	Don't know.
L108432	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
L108429	u612	m39	ABBOTT	No... It must have been Bourne.
L108428	u623	m39	PAMELA	Did he say anything to you?
L108427	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
L108426	u623	m39	PAMELA	They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
L108425	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What?
L108415	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
L108414	u623	m39	PAMELA	Sorry to wake you.
L108317	u623	m39	PAMELA	Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
L108316	u612	m39	ABBOTT	It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
L108315	u623	m39	PAMELA	So what's he doing? You believe him?
L108253	u612	m39	ABBOTT	There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
L108252	u623	m39	PAMELA	Don't you want answers?
L108251	u612	m39	ABBOTT	My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
L108250	u623	m39	PAMELA	Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
L108249	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
L108099	u623	m39	PAMELA	And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
L108098	u612	m39	ABBOTT	You don't know what you're getting into here.
L108097	u623	m39	PAMELA	I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
L108096	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Berlin!
L108062	u612	m39	ABBOTT	So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
L108061	u623	m39	PAMELA	What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
L108060	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
L108059	u623	m39	PAMELA	May I finish?
L108058	u612	m39	ABBOTT	We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
L108057	u623	m39	PAMELA	Excuse me.
L108056	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Do you know what his budget was?
L108055	u623	m39	PAMELA	...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
L108054	u623	m39	PAMELA	...this is Conklin's computer.
L108053	u623	m39	PAMELA	...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
L108044	u623	m39	PAMELA	I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
L108043	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
L108042	u623	m39	PAMELA	And Bourne? Where's he now?
L108041	u612	m39	ABBOTT	I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
L108040	u623	m39	PAMELA	So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
L108039	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
L108038	u623	m39	PAMELA	I want to know what happened.
L108037	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
L108036	u623	m39	PAMELA	Let's talk about Conklin.
L108035	u623	m39	PAMELA	He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
L108034	u612	m39	ABBOTT	To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
L108033	u623	m39	PAMELA	I want to know about Treadstone.
L108032	u612	m39	ABBOTT	And what are we looking for?
L108030	u612	m39	ABBOTT	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
L108029	u623	m39	PAMELA	That's not gonna fly.
L108028	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Never heard of it.
L108027	u623	m39	PAMELA	Treadstone.
L108339	u627	m39	ZORN	Okay... 
L108338	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Show me again...
L108337	u627	m39	ZORN	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
L108336	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Who else knows about this?
L108335	u627	m39	ZORN	Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
L108334	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Lots of people...
L108333	u627	m39	ZORN	Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
L108332	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Keep going...
L108331	u627	m39	ZORN	Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
L108330	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Jesus...
L108329	u627	m39	ZORN	Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
L108328	u612	m39	ABBOTT	It was staged?
L108327	u627	m39	ZORN	There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
L108326	u612	m39	ABBOTT	And?
L108325	u627	m39	ZORN	You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
L108324	u612	m39	ABBOTT	What do you have, Danny?
L108323	u627	m39	ZORN	I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
L108322	u627	m39	ZORN	The sooner the better.
L108321	u612	m39	ABBOTT	She say what time I should call?
L108319	u612	m39	ABBOTT	Thanks.
L108318	u627	m39	ZORN	Sir...
L108515	u613	m39	BOURNE	I'm sorry.
L108514	u616	m39	IRENA	Is this really happening?
L108513	u613	m39	BOURNE	I have to go now.
L108512	u613	m39	BOURNE	No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
L108511	u616	m39	IRENA	Because you're afraid!
L108510	u613	m39	BOURNE	I can't let you do that either.
L108509	u616	m39	IRENA	I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
L108508	u613	m39	BOURNE	Look at me.
L108507	u616	m39	IRENA	YOU'RE A LIAR!
L108506	u613	m39	BOURNE	You know I'm not.
L108505	u616	m39	IRENA	You're a liar.
L108504	u613	m39	BOURNE	It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
L108502	u613	m39	BOURNE	I don't want you to forgive me.
L108501	u616	m39	IRENA	How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
L108500	u613	m39	BOURNE	They loved you.  And I killed them.
L108499	u616	m39	IRENA	You killed them.
L108498	u613	m39	BOURNE	It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
L108497	u613	m39	BOURNE	I killed them.
L108496	u616	m39	IRENA	Then what?
L108495	u613	m39	BOURNE	That's not what happened to your parents.
L108494	u616	m39	IRENA	Yes...
L108493	u613	m39	BOURNE	It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
L108491	u616	m39	IRENA	What?
L108490	u613	m39	BOURNE	I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
L108489	u616	m39	IRENA	No, I do.
L108488	u613	m39	BOURNE	No. It's because you don't know how they died.
L108487	u616	m39	IRENA	It's nothing. It's just a picture.
L108486	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
L108485	u616	m39	IRENA	Okay.
L108484	u613	m39	BOURNE	Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
L108482	u616	m39	IRENA	I speak English.
L108481	u613	m39	BOURNE	Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
L108193	u618	m39	JARDA	-- take the back -- get another car --
L108192	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- what? --
L108191	u618	m39	JARDA	-- my coat -- but we should --
L108190	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- car keys?
L108184	u613	m39	BOURNE	How long? How long do I have -- 
L108183	u618	m39	JARDA	I'm sorry.
L108182	u613	m39	BOURNE	You called it in?
L108179	u613	m39	BOURNE	I did.
L108178	u618	m39	JARDA	She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
L108176	u618	m39	JARDA	I don't know! Why would I lie?
L108175	u613	m39	BOURNE	What's going on in Berlin?
L108174	u618	m39	JARDA	I don't know who that is.
L108173	u613	m39	BOURNE	Pamela Landy?
L108172	u618	m39	JARDA	A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
L108171	u613	m39	BOURNE	Who sent you to Greece?
L108170	u618	m39	JARDA	I don't know.
L108169	u613	m39	BOURNE	You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
L108166	u618	m39	JARDA	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
L108165	u613	m39	BOURNE	Try again.
L108164	u618	m39	JARDA	He's dead.
L108163	u613	m39	BOURNE	Conklin.
L108162	u618	m39	JARDA	What do you want?
L108161	u613	m39	BOURNE	She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
L108160	u618	m39	JARDA	So why didn't you kill me then?
L108158	u618	m39	JARDA	I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
L108157	u613	m39	BOURNE	You still should've moved.
L108155	u618	m39	JARDA	Sorry. Old habits.
L108154	u613	m39	BOURNE	Front. Use your teeth.
L108152	u613	m39	BOURNE	Drop it.
L108151	u618	m39	JARDA	Felt a little light.
L108150	u613	m39	BOURNE	I emptied it.
L108413	u619	m39	MARIE	Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
L108412	u613	m39	BOURNE	God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
L108411	u613	m39	BOURNE	I only dream about people who are dead.
L108410	u619	m39	MARIE	You do?
L108409	u613	m39	BOURNE	I know it's a dream.
L108408	u613	m39	BOURNE	It might have.
L108407	u619	m39	MARIE	It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
L108406	u613	m39	BOURNE	I did.
L108405	u619	m39	MARIE	But you found another choice.
L108404	u613	m39	BOURNE	I wanted to kill him.
L107970	u613	m39	BOURNE	Tell me later.
L107969	u619	m39	MARIE	I love you, too.
L107967	u613	m39	BOURNE	There's no choice.
L107966	u619	m39	MARIE	Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
L107965	u613	m39	BOURNE	I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
L107964	u619	m39	MARIE	There must be another way!
L107963	u613	m39	BOURNE	If he crosses the bridge, it is.
L107962	u619	m39	MARIE	What if it's not who you think it is?
L107961	u613	m39	BOURNE	I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
L107960	u619	m39	MARIE	Where are you going?
L107959	u613	m39	BOURNE	You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
L107958	u619	m39	MARIE	-- hang on --
L107957	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
L107956	u619	m39	MARIE	-- it's just him? --
L107955	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- not yet --
L107954	u619	m39	MARIE	Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
L107953	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
L107952	u619	m39	MARIE	-- where? -
L107951	u613	m39	BOURNE	Switch! You drive!
L107950	u619	m39	MARIE	What?
L107949	u613	m39	BOURNE	You drive.
L107948	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
L107947	u619	m39	MARIE	-- where's left to go? --
L107946	u613	m39	BOURNE	Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
L107945	u619	m39	MARIE	I don't want to move again... I like it here.
L107944	u613	m39	BOURNE	We can't wait to be sure.
L107943	u619	m39	MARIE	...but you're not -- you're not sure...
L107942	u613	m39	BOURNE	Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
L107941	u619	m39	MARIE	Where --
L107940	u613	m39	BOURNE	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
L107939	u619	m39	MARIE	That's crazy.
L107938	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
L107937	u619	m39	MARIE	So...
L107936	u613	m39	BOURNE	He was at the campground yesterday.
L107935	u619	m39	MARIE	But you're sure?
L107934	u613	m39	BOURNE	We pushed it. We got lazy.
L107933	u619	m39	MARIE	But we were so careful.
L107932	u613	m39	BOURNE	The Telegraph office.
L107931	u619	m39	MARIE	No... How?
L107926	u619	m39	MARIE	One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
L107925	u613	m39	BOURNE	But it ends up the same.
L107924	u619	m39	MARIE	You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
L107923	u613	m39	BOURNE	I should be better by now.
L107922	u619	m39	MARIE	Sleep. Sleep now.
L107921	u619	m39	MARIE	I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
L107920	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's just a nightmare.
L107919	u619	m39	MARIE	I worry when you get like this.
L107918	u613	m39	BOURNE	I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
L107917	u613	m39	BOURNE	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
L107916	u619	m39	MARIE	We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
L107915	u613	m39	BOURNE	-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
L107914	u619	m39	MARIE	-- it hasn't been two years --
L107913	u613	m39	BOURNE	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
L107912	u619	m39	MARIE	You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
L107911	u613	m39	BOURNE	No. There's nothing new.
L107910	u619	m39	MARIE	I'll get the book.
L107909	u613	m39	BOURNE	Conklin up front.
L107908	u619	m39	MARIE	Where were you, Jason? In the car.
L108312	u622	m39	NICKY	...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
L108311	u613	m39	BOURNE	I was here!
L108310	u622	m39	NICKY	No... Jason... please...
L108309	u622	m39	NICKY	You never worked Berlin...
L108308	u613	m39	BOURNE	That's a lie!
L108307	u622	m39	NICKY	Your first assignment was Geneva.
L108306	u613	m39	BOURNE	My first job.
L108305	u622	m39	NICKY	No. You never worked Berlin.
L108304	u613	m39	BOURNE	For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
L108303	u622	m39	NICKY	What do you mean?
L108302	u613	m39	BOURNE	So when was I here?
L108301	u622	m39	NICKY	He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
L108300	u613	m39	BOURNE	Abbott?
L108299	u622	m39	NICKY	Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
L108298	u613	m39	BOURNE	Why are you here, then?
L108296	u622	m39	NICKY	Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
L108295	u613	m39	BOURNE	What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
L108293	u613	m39	BOURNE	I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
L108292	u622	m39	NICKY	You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
L108291	u613	m39	BOURNE	I killed him???
L108290	u622	m39	NICKY	And you got to him before we could.
L108289	u613	m39	BOURNE	Last week? When?
L108288	u622	m39	NICKY	It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
L108287	u613	m39	BOURNE	A Russian?
L108286	u622	m39	NICKY	Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
L108285	u613	m39	BOURNE	Say it.
L108284	u613	m39	BOURNE	I want to hear it from you.
L108283	u622	m39	NICKY	What is this, a game?
L108282	u613	m39	BOURNE	How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
L108280	u622	m39	NICKY	They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
L108279	u613	m39	BOURNE	Why is she trying to kill me?
L108275	u613	m39	BOURNE	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
L108274	u622	m39	NICKY	You hear me? I believed you.
L108273	u613	m39	BOURNE	Who is Pamela Landy?
L108272	u622	m39	NICKY	I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
L108265	u613	m39	BOURNE	Get on it.
L108264	u622	m39	NICKY	Yes.
L108263	u613	m39	BOURNE	See that tram coming around the corner?
L108531	u623	m39	PAMELA	Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
L108530	u613	m39	BOURNE	You didn't answer my question.
L108529	u623	m39	PAMELA	Sounds like a threat.
L108528	u613	m39	BOURNE	Don't need it. I remember everything.
L108526	u623	m39	PAMELA	Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
L108525	u613	m39	BOURNE	What's that?
L108524	u623	m39	PAMELA	Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
L108522	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are you disappointed?
L108521	u613	m39	BOURNE	Why am I alive?
L108520	u623	m39	PAMELA	Careful...
L108519	u613	m39	BOURNE	Oh, shit...
L108518	u623	m39	PAMELA	Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
L108517	u613	m39	BOURNE	Where am I?
L108246	u613	m39	BOURNE	Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
L108245	u623	m39	PAMELA	Okay, Jason, your move.
L108242	u613	m39	BOURNE	There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
L108241	u623	m39	PAMELA	Who?
L108240	u613	m39	BOURNE	I want someone I know to take me in.
L108239	u623	m39	PAMELA	Okay, how do you want to do it?
L108238	u613	m39	BOURNE	I want to come in.
L108237	u623	m39	PAMELA	What do you want?
L108236	u623	m39	PAMELA	Bourne?
L108235	u613	m39	BOURNE	It's me.
L108441	u614	m39	CRONIN	Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
L108440	u623	m39	PAMELA	What? The tapes?
L108439	u614	m39	CRONIN	You're sure?
L108431	u614	m39	CRONIN	But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
L108430	u623	m39	PAMELA	We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
L108370	u623	m39	PAMELA	This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
L108369	u614	m39	CRONIN	What?
L108368	u623	m39	PAMELA	Alright... take it down.
L108357	u623	m39	PAMELA	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
L108356	u614	m39	CRONIN	Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
L108348	u623	m39	PAMELA	-- the hotel -- how far? --
L108347	u614	m39	CRONIN	-- go -- take the van! --
L108102	u623	m39	PAMELA	-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
L108101	u614	m39	CRONIN	-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
L108072	u623	m39	PAMELA	Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
L108071	u614	m39	CRONIN	There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
L108070	u623	m39	PAMELA	Who's going? Us?
L108069	u614	m39	CRONIN	Looks like he's been detained.
L108012	u623	m39	PAMELA	And the Germans can't match it?
L108011	u614	m39	CRONIN	-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
L108010	u614	m39	CRONIN	I'm working on it.
L108009	u623	m39	PAMELA	We need to get in there.
L107999	u626	m39	VIC	-- shut up! -- just shut the --
L107998	u617	m39	IVAN	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
L107997	u626	m39	VIC	-- who? -- who else is here? --
L107995	u617	m39	IVAN	Is there. Is all there.
L107994	u626	m39	VIC	This is everything? Is there.
L107993	u617	m39	IVAN	Now. Show now.
L107992	u626	m39	VIC	Here?
L107991	u617	m39	IVAN	Show me.
L108066	u623	m39	PAMELA	I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
L108065	u620	m39	MARSHALL	Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
L107985	u623	m39	PAMELA	For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
L107984	u620	m39	MARSHALL	Still...
L107983	u623	m39	PAMELA	We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
L107982	u620	m39	MARSHALL	It's a lot of money, Pam.
L107981	u623	m39	PAMELA	That's where we came out.
L107980	u620	m39	MARSHALL	I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
L108095	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
L108094	u621	m39	NEVINS/PHONE	Yes, sir -- ma'am...
L108093	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
L108092	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
L108091	u621	m39	NEVINS/PHONE	Me? Four years.
L108090	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	How long have you worked for the agency?
L108086	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
L108085	u621	m39	NEVINS/PHONE	Who's this?
L108084	u624	m39	PAMELA/PHONE	Mr. Nevins?
L108535	u623	m39	PAMELA	Felt promising. It's a start.
L108534	u622	m39	NICKY	So?
L108533	u623	m39	PAMELA	Let's give him half an hour.
L108256	u623	m39	PAMELA	Alright...
L108255	u622	m39	NICKY	I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
L108254	u623	m39	PAMELA	What do you think? Is he coming in?
L108231	u622	m39	NICKY	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
L108230	u623	m39	PAMELA	Is it fresh?
L108204	u622	m39	NICKY	Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
L108203	u623	m39	PAMELA	And why is that?
L108202	u622	m39	NICKY	I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
L108136	u623	m39	PAMELA	See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
L108135	u622	m39	NICKY	What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
L108134	u623	m39	PAMELA	Some women like Dobermans --
L108133	u622	m39	NICKY	These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
L108132	u623	m39	PAMELA	Did you?
L108131	u622	m39	NICKY	You mean, did I want a date?
L108130	u623	m39	PAMELA	You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
L108129	u622	m39	NICKY	You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
L108128	u623	m39	PAMELA	Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
L108127	u622	m39	NICKY	If you say so.
L108126	u623	m39	PAMELA	So he fooled you.
L108125	u622	m39	NICKY	I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
L108124	u623	m39	PAMELA	Believed what?
L108123	u622	m39	NICKY	Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
L108122	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are you an expert in amnesia?
L108121	u622	m39	NICKY	Am I a doctor, no, but...
L108120	u623	m39	PAMELA	I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
L108119	u623	m39	PAMELA	You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
L108118	u622	m39	NICKY	Good luck.
L108114	u622	m39	NICKY	Before this? Before Bourne? No.
L108113	u623	m39	PAMELA	Amnesia?
L108112	u622	m39	NICKY	Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
L108111	u623	m39	PAMELA	What kind of problems?
L108393	u623	m39	PAMELA	And what about you, anything?
L108392	u625	m39	TEDDY	Yes. In that order.
L108391	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are we hacking or asking?
L108390	u625	m39	TEDDY	We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
L108387	u623	m39	PAMELA	Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
L108386	u625	m39	TEDDY	His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
L108385	u623	m39	PAMELA	By who?
L108384	u625	m39	TEDDY	Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
L108355	u623	m39	PAMELA	Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
L108354	u625	m39	TEDDY	Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
L108224	u623	m39	PAMELA	Are we locked up?
L108223	u625	m39	TEDDY	No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
L108222	u623	m39	PAMELA	Anything?
L108018	u623	m39	PAMELA	"What the hell is a ""Treadstone?"""
L108017	u625	m39	TEDDY	Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
L108016	u623	m39	PAMELA	Do we know what this says?
L122054	u676	m43	CHUCK	The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
L122053	u673	m43	ALEKSEI	Nobody remembers that.
L122052	u676	m43	CHUCK	Worse than Warsaw.
L122051	u673	m43	ALEKSEI	It's bad.
L122041	u676	m43	CHUCK	So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
L122040	u673	m43	ALEKSEI	Six kilometers.  Four miles.
L122039	u676	m43	CHUCK	It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
L122553	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
L122552	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	You can't make it.
L122549	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Then we've just got shit.
L122548	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
L122547	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
L122545	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
L122544	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Nothing out there but ocean.
L122543	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	It's real.
L122542	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
L122541	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Jesus.
L122540	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	You are.
L122539	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	What's so damn funny?
L122535	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Shut up.
L122534	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
L122533	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
L122532	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	I float.  You sink.  End of story.
L122530	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
L122529	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
L122528	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	They're on autopilot.
L122527	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
L122513	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
L122512	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
L122505	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Thank you for fucking up my life.
L122504	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
L122494	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Yeah, sure, what?
L122493	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
L122492	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
L122491	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Die tomorrow or die today.
L122490	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
L122489	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
L122488	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
L122487	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
L122486	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	You quitter you quitter you quitter.
L122485	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
L122484	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	No!
L122483	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	I'm lost.  Goodbye.
L122465	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
L122464	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Why do they have to die for me?
L122463	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
L122462	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
L122461	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	What are you doing?
L122457	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
L122456	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	You're beautiful.  Marry me.
L122453	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Water water water --
L122452	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Fix raft first.
L122451	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Get water!
L122448	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	I'm putting it off.
L122447	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	You're putting off the inevitable.
L122446	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Moon's too bright.
L122445	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
L122444	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
L122443	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Survive today, that's the point.
L122442	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	If they can't see you, what's the point?
L122439	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
L122438	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	No.
L122437	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Take it, damn it.
L122436	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	No.
L122435	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Take it.
L122434	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	No more water, you said.
L122432	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Going to die anyway.
L122431	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Do too little you'll die.
L122430	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Do too much, I'll die.
L122429	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
L122428	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	No water, no work.
L122427	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
L122426	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Thirsty.
L122425	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	You've had today's water.
L122424	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Can't.  Need water.
L122423	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Get up, damn you.
L122422	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Feels so good to lie here.
L122421	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Get up.
L122418	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
L122417	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
L122416	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
L122415	u674	m43	BADCHUCK	Catch another fish tomorrow.
L122414	u681	m43	GOODCHUCK	Save some for tomorrow.
L122791	u676	m43	CHUCK	Sure.
L122790	u675	m43	BETTINA	Keep painting.  Promise me.
L122783	u675	m43	BETTINA	Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
L122782	u676	m43	CHUCK	No.  that was the last one.
L122781	u675	m43	BETTINA	Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
L122780	u676	m43	CHUCK	To tell you the truth -- you did.
L122779	u675	m43	BETTINA	You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
L122778	u676	m43	CHUCK	Well, not really, I --
L122777	u675	m43	BETTINA	I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
L122775	u675	m43	BETTINA	He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
L122774	u676	m43	CHUCK	Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
L122773	u676	m43	CHUCK	Well, I do a little drawing --
L122772	u675	m43	BETTINA	Oh?  You've tried?
L122771	u676	m43	CHUCK	They're harder to do than they look.
L122770	u675	m43	BETTINA	Yeah.  A long time ago.
L122769	u676	m43	CHUCK	Possible.  So you did those wings?
L122768	u675	m43	BETTINA	Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
L122765	u676	m43	CHUCK	Okay.  Sure.
L122764	u675	m43	BETTINA	Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
L122763	u676	m43	CHUCK	As much as anybody.
L122762	u675	m43	BETTINA	You know what happened to this?
L122761	u676	m43	CHUCK	No.
L122760	u675	m43	BETTINA	Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
L122759	u676	m43	CHUCK	There was an unavoidable delay.
L122758	u675	m43	BETTINA	You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
L122816	u676	m43	CHUCK	So do I.
L122815	u680	m43	ERICA	I've got lots of time.
L122814	u676	m43	CHUCK	Yeah, a long one.
L122813	u680	m43	ERICA	Must be a story there.
L122812	u676	m43	CHUCK	I had it on the island with me.
L122811	u680	m43	ERICA	You?  Personally?
L122810	u676	m43	CHUCK	Had a package to deliver.
L122809	u680	m43	ERICA	What brings you out to the sticks?
L122806	u676	m43	CHUCK	I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
L122805	u680	m43	ERICA	Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
L122674	u682	m43	KELLY	I'm so glad you're alive.
L122673	u676	m43	CHUCK	You too.
L122672	u682	m43	KELLY	I love you, Chuck.
L122671	u682	m43	KELLY	I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
L122670	u676	m43	CHUCK	It means a lot...that you came.
L122669	u682	m43	KELLY	I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
L122668	u676	m43	CHUCK	I don't know.  I really don't know.
L122667	u682	m43	KELLY	What will you do?
L122666	u676	m43	CHUCK	Great.  Really.
L122665	u682	m43	KELLY	You okay?
L122664	u676	m43	CHUCK	That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
L122663	u682	m43	KELLY	This is so unfair.
L122661	u676	m43	CHUCK	I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
L122660	u682	m43	KELLY	You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
L122659	u676	m43	CHUCK	Not when you have no choice.
L122658	u682	m43	KELLY	So simple to say, so hard to do.
L122657	u676	m43	CHUCK	Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
L122656	u682	m43	KELLY	Come on.  Try.
L122655	u682	m43	KELLY	Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
L122654	u676	m43	CHUCK	The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
L122653	u682	m43	KELLY	Yeah?
L122652	u676	m43	CHUCK	The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
L122651	u682	m43	KELLY	Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
L122650	u676	m43	CHUCK	That about sums it up.
L122649	u682	m43	KELLY	Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
L122648	u676	m43	CHUCK	What was inside?
L122647	u682	m43	KELLY	Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
L122646	u676	m43	CHUCK	There was a coffin?
L122642	u676	m43	CHUCK	My epitaph.
L122641	u682	m43	KELLY	What's that, written on the sail?
L122640	u676	m43	CHUCK	Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
L122639	u682	m43	KELLY	All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
L122636	u676	m43	CHUCK	That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
L122635	u682	m43	KELLY	What's that?
L122625	u682	m43	KELLY	No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
L122624	u676	m43	CHUCK	Is that Jango?
L122623	u682	m43	KELLY	Her name's Hannah.
L122621	u676	m43	CHUCK	You have any children?
L122620	u682	m43	KELLY	I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
L122619	u676	m43	CHUCK	I would have done the same thing.
L122618	u682	m43	KELLY	If I'd known you were alive --
L122617	u676	m43	CHUCK	I know.
L122616	u682	m43	KELLY	I would never --
L122615	u676	m43	CHUCK	I thought you might have.
L122614	u682	m43	KELLY	I got married.
L122612	u676	m43	CHUCK	A few things came up.  Or went down.
L122611	u682	m43	KELLY	Right back, you said you'd be right back.
L122608	u676	m43	CHUCK	Hey...hey...it's okay!
L122607	u682	m43	KELLY	I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
L122302	u682	m43	KELLY	Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
L122301	u676	m43	CHUCK	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
L122300	u682	m43	KELLY	Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
L122298	u676	m43	CHUCK	Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
L122297	u682	m43	KELLY	Get back?  From where?
L122296	u682	m43	KELLY	Don't even start.
L122295	u676	m43	CHUCK	Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
L122294	u682	m43	KELLY	What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
L122293	u676	m43	CHUCK	I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
L122292	u682	m43	KELLY	Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
L122291	u682	m43	KELLY	I burned the Christmas tree.
L122290	u676	m43	CHUCK	No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
L122289	u682	m43	KELLY	I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
L122288	u676	m43	CHUCK	Yes there is.
L122287	u682	m43	KELLY	There isn't any us.
L122286	u676	m43	CHUCK	It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
L122285	u682	m43	KELLY	That's your dog.
L122214	u676	m43	CHUCK	I can't take him to work.
L122213	u682	m43	KELLY	No.
L122212	u676	m43	CHUCK	Could you watch Jango?
L122211	u682	m43	KELLY	We're not over-reacting.
L122210	u676	m43	CHUCK	We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
L122209	u682	m43	KELLY	This isn't working out.
L122207	u682	m43	KELLY	You want to.
L122206	u676	m43	CHUCK	I have to.
L122205	u682	m43	KELLY	You can't go now.
L122204	u676	m43	CHUCK	Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
L122203	u676	m43	CHUCK	You did?
L122202	u682	m43	KELLY	A ring.  I wanted a ring.
L122201	u676	m43	CHUCK	I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
L122197	u682	m43	KELLY	For when I travel?
L122196	u676	m43	CHUCK	You know, for when you travel.
L122194	u676	m43	CHUCK	And for you --
L122193	u682	m43	KELLY	A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
L122192	u676	m43	CHUCK	I can't even keep fish alive.
L122191	u682	m43	KELLY	He's your cute thing.
L122190	u676	m43	CHUCK	He is a cute thing.
L122189	u682	m43	KELLY	I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
L122188	u676	m43	CHUCK	Hey, look at you.
L122185	u682	m43	KELLY	Let me guess, Russia came up?
L122184	u676	m43	CHUCK	Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
L122183	u682	m43	KELLY	You don't seem too happy about it.
L122182	u676	m43	CHUCK	Four four.  A record.
L122180	u676	m43	CHUCK	Not if you work for FedEx.
L122179	u682	m43	KELLY	Merry Christmas eve.
L122154	u682	m43	KELLY	Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
L122153	u676	m43	CHUCK	What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
L122152	u682	m43	KELLY	Chuck.
L122150	u682	m43	KELLY	Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
L122149	u676	m43	CHUCK	Got to follow the paper path here.
L122148	u676	m43	CHUCK	I thought I did.
L122147	u682	m43	KELLY	Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
L122146	u676	m43	CHUCK	Cold.
L122145	u682	m43	KELLY	How was Russia?
L122144	u676	m43	CHUCK	Let's take a look.
L122143	u682	m43	KELLY	My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
L122142	u676	m43	CHUCK	You smell like formaldehyde.
L122141	u682	m43	KELLY	Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
L122139	u676	m43	CHUCK	Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
L122138	u682	m43	KELLY	Sonofabitch!
L122282	u683	m43	LESLIE	There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
L122281	u676	m43	CHUCK	Anything else?
L122280	u683	m43	LESLIE	The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
L122279	u676	m43	CHUCK	When's the next Jumbo?
L122263	u676	m43	CHUCK	Terrific.  Yours?
L122262	u683	m43	LESLIE	And how was your Christmas?
L122261	u676	m43	CHUCK	I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
L122580	u678	m43	DOCTOR	Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
L122579	u676	m43	CHUCK	Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
L122577	u676	m43	CHUCK	Not to mention on me.
L122576	u678	m43	DOCTOR	You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
L122575	u676	m43	CHUCK	Yes, yes he did.
L122574	u678	m43	DOCTOR	Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
L122573	u676	m43	CHUCK	I most definitely say I am.
L122572	u678	m43	DOCTOR	If you say you are.
L122571	u676	m43	CHUCK	But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
L122570	u678	m43	DOCTOR	Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
L122569	u676	m43	CHUCK	I am one lucky guy.
L122568	u678	m43	DOCTOR	And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
L122567	u676	m43	CHUCK	Which I didn't have.
L122566	u678	m43	DOCTOR	Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
L122565	u676	m43	CHUCK	All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
L122564	u678	m43	DOCTOR	Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
L122563	u676	m43	CHUCK	Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
L122560	u678	m43	DOCTOR	Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
L122559	u676	m43	CHUCK	My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
L122801	u676	m43	CHUCK	Yeah.
L122800	u679	m43	DRIVER	You're Chuck Noland.
L122799	u676	m43	CHUCK	Sure.
L122798	u679	m43	DRIVER	Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
L122797	u676	m43	CHUCK	I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
L122796	u676	m43	CHUCK	No.
L122795	u679	m43	DRIVER	You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
L122793	u679	m43	DRIVER	You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
L122792	u676	m43	CHUCK	Need some help?
L122248	u676	m43	CHUCK	Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
L122247	u685	m43	ROGER	Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
L122246	u676	m43	CHUCK	Really?
L122244	u676	m43	CHUCK	True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
L122243	u685	m43	ROGER	Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
L122242	u676	m43	CHUCK	But chickens?
L122228	u676	m43	CHUCK	So did I.
L122227	u685	m43	ROGER	Thought you were going to bring her.
L122224	u685	m43	ROGER	Let's eat.
L122223	u676	m43	CHUCK	Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
L122753	u676	m43	CHUCK	The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
L122752	u684	m43	MOM	What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
L122749	u684	m43	MOM	This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
L122748	u676	m43	CHUCK	I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
L122745	u676	m43	CHUCK	I wanted to come here.
L122744	u684	m43	MOM	Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
L122743	u676	m43	CHUCK	When'd you start working here?
L122259	u684	m43	MOM	There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
L122258	u676	m43	CHUCK	Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
L122257	u684	m43	MOM	I'm doing fine.
L122256	u676	m43	CHUCK	The place is falling apart.
L122255	u684	m43	MOM	Don't you even think about it.
L122254	u676	m43	CHUCK	Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
L122253	u684	m43	MOM	Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
L122252	u676	m43	CHUCK	Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
L122236	u684	m43	MOM	That new roof, that's your doing.
L122235	u676	m43	CHUCK	Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
L122230	u676	m43	CHUCK	It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
L122229	u684	m43	MOM	It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
L122220	u676	m43	CHUCK	Mom, meet Jango.
L122219	u684	m43	MOM	What happened to your pants?
L122733	u687	m43	TECHNICIAN	You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
L122732	u676	m43	CHUCK	Can you find her?
L122731	u687	m43	TECHNICIAN	Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
L122730	u687	m43	TECHNICIAN	Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
L122729	u676	m43	CHUCK	What about the sender?
L122728	u687	m43	TECHNICIAN	Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
L122270	u676	m43	CHUCK	Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
L122269	u687	m43	TECHNICIAN	Trying.
L122276	u676	m43	CHUCK	Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
L122275	u688	m43	VOICE	Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
L122274	u676	m43	CHUCK	What's going on down there?
L122273	u688	m43	VOICE	It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
L122272	u676	m43	CHUCK	Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
L122271	u688	m43	VOICE	Kamal is not here.
L122737	u686	m43	STAN	No sweat.
L122736	u676	m43	CHUCK	Thanks.  For everything.
L122726	u686	m43	STAN	Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
L122725	u676	m43	CHUCK	I need to do it.
L122724	u686	m43	STAN	You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
L122723	u676	m43	CHUCK	Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
L122722	u686	m43	STAN	What, then?
L122720	u686	m43	STAN	Deep, real deep.
L122719	u676	m43	CHUCK	Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
L122718	u686	m43	STAN	Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
L122717	u676	m43	CHUCK	That's what it's about.
L122716	u686	m43	STAN	What?
L122715	u676	m43	CHUCK	Take your time.
L122713	u676	m43	CHUCK	Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
L122712	u686	m43	STAN	Digital laser readers.
L122691	u676	m43	CHUCK	Believe me I know.
L122690	u686	m43	STAN	That's all there is.
L122689	u676	m43	CHUCK	To life.
L122688	u686	m43	STAN	To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
L122686	u676	m43	CHUCK	What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
L122685	u686	m43	STAN	I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
L122684	u676	m43	CHUCK	Hallelujah.
L122683	u686	m43	STAN	You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
L122681	u676	m43	CHUCK	To Wilson.
L122680	u686	m43	STAN	To Wilson.
L122677	u676	m43	CHUCK	I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
L122676	u686	m43	STAN	When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
L122638	u676	m43	CHUCK	Forty-three days.
L122637	u686	m43	STAN	You were how long on this?
L122634	u676	m43	CHUCK	Time I had lots of.
L122633	u686	m43	STAN	Must have taken a hell of a long time.
L122632	u676	m43	CHUCK	I braided them.
L122631	u686	m43	STAN	Cool ropes.
L122630	u676	m43	CHUCK	You should have smelled me.
L122629	u686	m43	STAN	This stinks really bad.
L122628	u676	m43	CHUCK	Want to see my raft?
L122627	u686	m43	STAN	How about we go somewhere else?
L122602	u676	m43	CHUCK	This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
L122601	u686	m43	STAN	Hello.
L122599	u686	m43	STAN	You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
L122598	u676	m43	CHUCK	I beat the odds!
L122590	u676	m43	CHUCK	I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
L122589	u686	m43	STAN	You're fucking dead!
L122588	u676	m43	CHUCK	It's me.
L122587	u686	m43	STAN	God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
L122584	u676	m43	CHUCK	Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
L122583	u686	m43	STAN	Hello?
L122266	u676	m43	CHUCK	Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
L122265	u686	m43	STAN	Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
L122128	u686	m43	STAN	We're on.
L122127	u676	m43	CHUCK	Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
L122126	u686	m43	STAN	Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
L122125	u676	m43	CHUCK	A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
L122123	u676	m43	CHUCK	This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
L122122	u686	m43	STAN	I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
L122121	u676	m43	CHUCK	You are one sick fucker.
L122120	u686	m43	STAN	Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
L122119	u676	m43	CHUCK	For the third time.
L122118	u686	m43	STAN	That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
L122117	u676	m43	CHUCK	That's why you're a gambling man.
L122116	u686	m43	STAN	We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
L122115	u676	m43	CHUCK	I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
L122114	u686	m43	STAN	You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
L122113	u676	m43	CHUCK	Forget it.
L122112	u686	m43	STAN	Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
L122111	u676	m43	CHUCK	And never take.
L122110	u686	m43	STAN	For all those vacation days you got coming.
L122109	u676	m43	CHUCK	It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
L122108	u686	m43	STAN	I didn't know we had sailboats.
L122107	u676	m43	CHUCK	"Baloney.  I do see the damn ""big picture."""
L122106	u686	m43	STAN	You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
L122105	u676	m43	CHUCK	Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
L122104	u686	m43	STAN	What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
L122103	u676	m43	CHUCK	I was making a point.
L122102	u686	m43	STAN	The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
L122101	u676	m43	CHUCK	You fucked us over.
L122100	u686	m43	STAN	I'm touched.
L122099	u676	m43	CHUCK	Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
L122098	u686	m43	STAN	But I might not have.
L122097	u676	m43	CHUCK	I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
L122096	u686	m43	STAN	It was fifteen minutes late.
L122095	u676	m43	CHUCK	You what?
L122093	u676	m43	CHUCK	Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
L122092	u686	m43	STAN	How'd it go?
L122091	u676	m43	CHUCK	Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
L122090	u686	m43	STAN	What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
L122526	u676	m43	CHUCK	No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
L122525	u677	m43	CHUCK/CAPTAIN	Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
L122524	u676	m43	CHUCK	As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
L122523	u677	m43	CHUCK/CAPTAIN	San Francisco.  And you?
L122522	u676	m43	CHUCK	May I ask, where are you bound?
L122521	u677	m43	CHUCK/CAPTAIN	Permission granted.
L122520	u676	m43	CHUCK	Permission to come aboard, sir.
L188218	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
L188217	u839	m54	AUD	It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
L188210	u839	m54	AUD	But, Father, it IS!
L188209	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	It's all right! It isn't happening!
L187976	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
L187975	u839	m54	AUD	It's your fantasy...
L187974	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
L187973	u839	m54	AUD	There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
L187972	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
L187971	u839	m54	AUD	It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
L187967	u839	m54	AUD	You're losing your temper!
L187966	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
L187964	u839	m54	AUD	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
L187963	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well... where is he?
L187959	u839	m54	AUD	There IS no one.
L187958	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
L187957	u839	m54	AUD	Who, Father?
L187956	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Right! Where is he?
L187952	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Open up! I know you're in there!
L187951	u839	m54	AUD	Ah! It's my father!
L187950	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Open up! I know you're in there!
L188310	u840	m54	ERIK	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
L188309	u839	m54	AUD	I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
L188308	u840	m54	ERIK	No... no...
L188307	u839	m54	AUD	Then I shall come too.
L188304	u839	m54	AUD	No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
L188303	u840	m54	ERIK	There is something I must ask the Gods...
L188302	u839	m54	AUD	Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
L188301	u840	m54	ERIK	Not quite...
L188300	u839	m54	AUD	Erik! You've done what you came to do!
L188298	u840	m54	ERIK	The second note to wake the Gods...
L188297	u839	m54	AUD	The second note.
L188282	u839	m54	AUD	Then let go!
L188281	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes -- I believe you do.
L188280	u839	m54	AUD	You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
L188279	u840	m54	ERIK	I... but I...
L188278	u839	m54	AUD	Do you believe I love you?
L188277	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course.
L188276	u839	m54	AUD	YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
L188272	u840	m54	ERIK	I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
L188271	u839	m54	AUD	No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
L188258	u840	m54	ERIK	That's right!
L188257	u839	m54	AUD	No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
L188052	u839	m54	AUD	No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
L188051	u840	m54	ERIK	And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
L188049	u840	m54	ERIK	Goodbye, Aud...
L188048	u839	m54	AUD	But you don't realize....
L188047	u840	m54	ERIK	No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
L188046	u839	m54	AUD	Erik. You don't understand.
L188045	u840	m54	ERIK	I'll bring it back.
L188044	u839	m54	AUD	No!
L188041	u839	m54	AUD	Why?
L188040	u840	m54	ERIK	Where's the Cloak Invisible?
L188039	u839	m54	AUD	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
L188038	u840	m54	ERIK	Just give me a hand.
L187989	u839	m54	AUD	But, Erik...
L187988	u840	m54	ERIK	Halfdan the Black.
L187987	u839	m54	AUD	Who?
L187986	u840	m54	ERIK	We mustn't let him land!
L187984	u840	m54	ERIK	And the week before that?
L187983	u839	m54	AUD	You're as bad as my father.
L187982	u840	m54	ERIK	Five this week; how many the week before?
L187981	u839	m54	AUD	That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
L187980	u840	m54	ERIK	And I thought you said it was something special...
L187979	u839	m54	AUD	Oh, for goodness' sake!
L187978	u840	m54	ERIK	The fifth one this week!
L187977	u839	m54	AUD	The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
L187949	u840	m54	ERIK	I've never been to bed with anybody!
L187948	u839	m54	AUD	I've never LOVED anybody!
L187947	u840	m54	ERIK	You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
L187946	u839	m54	AUD	Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
L187945	u840	m54	ERIK	We never went to bed together.
L187944	u839	m54	AUD	But you LOVED her all the same...
L187943	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
L187942	u839	m54	AUD	What was she like?
L187941	u840	m54	ERIK	It was different...
L187940	u839	m54	AUD	What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
L187939	u840	m54	ERIK	HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
L187938	u839	m54	AUD	No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
L187937	u840	m54	ERIK	You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
L187936	u839	m54	AUD	No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
L187935	u840	m54	ERIK	"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"
L187934	u839	m54	AUD	Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
L187853	u839	m54	AUD	But surely you know...?
L187852	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes.
L187851	u839	m54	AUD	WHY?
L187848	u839	m54	AUD	Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
L187847	u840	m54	ERIK	What?
L187846	u839	m54	AUD	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
L187845	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter?
L187843	u840	m54	ERIK	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
L187842	u839	m54	AUD	Those things in your hands.
L187841	u840	m54	ERIK	What are what?
L187840	u839	m54	AUD	Please! Please! What are those?
L187836	u839	m54	AUD	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
L187835	u840	m54	ERIK	"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"
L187834	u839	m54	AUD	Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
L187833	u840	m54	ERIK	WELCOME?
L187832	u839	m54	AUD	I said welcome.
L187831	u840	m54	ERIK	WHAT did you say?
L188245	u851	m54	LOKI	SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
L188244	u840	m54	ERIK	We blew the Horn Resounding.
L188243	u851	m54	LOKI	How do we know this is the way?
L188122	u851	m54	LOKI	What d'you mean?
L188121	u840	m54	ERIK	But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
L188118	u851	m54	LOKI	It was my master Keitel's idea.
L188117	u840	m54	ERIK	But --
L188115	u851	m54	LOKI	Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
L188114	u840	m54	ERIK	LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
L187468	u841	m54	FREYA	That I cannot tell you.
L187467	u840	m54	ERIK	And will the dead ever return, Freya?
L187464	u840	m54	ERIK	I will go and wake them up!
L187463	u841	m54	FREYA	The Gods are asleep, Erik.
L187462	u840	m54	ERIK	Is there nothing men can do?
L187458	u841	m54	FREYA	The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
L187457	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
L187456	u841	m54	FREYA	But have you ever seen it? Think back...
L187455	u840	m54	ERIK	The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
L187454	u841	m54	FREYA	Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
L187452	u841	m54	FREYA	Is it summer or winter, Erik?
L187451	u840	m54	ERIK	It is day, of course, Freya.
L187450	u841	m54	FREYA	Is it night or day, Erik?
L187449	u840	m54	ERIK	I see the world.
L187448	u841	m54	FREYA	What do you see, Erik?
L187445	u841	m54	FREYA	They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
L187444	u840	m54	ERIK	I shouldn't have come.
L187443	u841	m54	FREYA	"Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the ""Viking""?"
L188187	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	The important thing is not to panic.
L188186	u840	m54	ERIK	But it IS! Look!
L188140	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
L188139	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes... oh, yes...
L188138	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
L188137	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
L188136	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Is there something the matter with it?
L188011	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
L188010	u840	m54	ERIK	You don't know Halfdan the Black.
L188009	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
L188008	u840	m54	ERIK	He wants to kill US!
L188007	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Don't talk nonsense.
L188006	u840	m54	ERIK	Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
L188005	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Why?
L188004	u840	m54	ERIK	He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
L188001	u840	m54	ERIK	"They'll be more than ""hurt"" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!"
L188000	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
L187997	u840	m54	ERIK	You've got to let me go!
L187996	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
L187932	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes?
L187931	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	I'll tell you what...
L187928	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
L187927	u840	m54	ERIK	The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
L187926	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well, how d'you think I feel?
L187925	u840	m54	ERIK	Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
L187924	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
L187923	u840	m54	ERIK	No.
L187922	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
L187921	u840	m54	ERIK	No, no... It was very... er, nice.
L187920	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	We're just not a very musical nation...
L187901	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	"Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes ""TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"""
L187900	u840	m54	ERIK	No. 
L187899	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
L187898	u840	m54	ERIK	Really.
L187897	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	REALLY?
L187896	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
L187893	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	You're just saying that.
L187892	u840	m54	ERIK	Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
L187889	u840	m54	ERIK	No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
L187888	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	But you don't want to hear it.
L187887	u840	m54	ERIK	I'm sure it's lovely.
L187886	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	A lot of people like our singing.
L187885	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
L187884	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
L187883	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
L187882	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
L187881	u840	m54	ERIK	That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
L187880	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Would you like us to sing to you?
L187869	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well... isn't it great?
L187868	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
L187867	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
L187866	u840	m54	ERIK	How?
L187858	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
L187857	u840	m54	ERIK	No... we don't...
L188390	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't know! I just did!
L188389	u846	m54	HELGA	Why should you care?
L188341	u840	m54	ERIK	Odin!
L188340	u846	m54	HELGA	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
L188339	u840	m54	ERIK	Is THAT Odin?
L188332	u840	m54	ERIK	Well... no...
L188331	u846	m54	HELGA	Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
L188330	u840	m54	ERIK	I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
L188329	u846	m54	HELGA	What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
L188328	u840	m54	ERIK	Why?
L188327	u846	m54	HELGA	What a stupid idea.
L188326	u840	m54	ERIK	I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
L187409	u840	m54	ERIK	Tell me your name?
L187408	u846	m54	HELGA	Why... should YOU care?
L187407	u840	m54	ERIK	Why should you care?
L187406	u846	m54	HELGA	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
L187405	u840	m54	ERIK	You told them I raped you -- why?
L187404	u846	m54	HELGA	Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
L187403	u840	m54	ERIK	I didn't mean to!
L187402	u846	m54	HELGA	Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
L187393	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh, thanks.
L187392	u846	m54	HELGA	Aaagh! Rape!
L187391	u840	m54	ERIK	Louder.
L187390	u846	m54	HELGA	Ah.
L187389	u840	m54	ERIK	Scream.
L187388	u846	m54	HELGA	And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
L187387	u840	m54	ERIK	I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
L187386	u846	m54	HELGA	Well you started it.
L187385	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
L187384	u846	m54	HELGA	But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
L187383	u840	m54	ERIK	To pay for the next expedition, of course.
L187382	u846	m54	HELGA	Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
L187381	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
L187380	u846	m54	HELGA	What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
L187379	u840	m54	ERIK	Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
L187378	u846	m54	HELGA	You DON'T like it, do you?
L187377	u840	m54	ERIK	About NOT raping you...
L187376	u846	m54	HELGA	About raping me?
L187375	u840	m54	ERIK	I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
L187374	u846	m54	HELGA	What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
L187373	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
L187372	u846	m54	HELGA	What?
L187371	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't suppose... no...
L187370	u846	m54	HELGA	Oh, get it over with.
L187369	u840	m54	ERIK	No. It isn't rape then, is it?
L187368	u846	m54	HELGA	What -- rape?
L187367	u840	m54	ERIK	No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
L187366	u846	m54	HELGA	You don't love ME.
L187365	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
L187363	u840	m54	ERIK	Sh!
L187362	u846	m54	HELGA	It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
L187361	u840	m54	ERIK	Shut up.
L187360	u846	m54	HELGA	What about the raping?
L187359	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes.
L187358	u846	m54	HELGA	Looting and pillaging, eh?
L187357	u840	m54	ERIK	Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
L187356	u846	m54	HELGA	Have you done this sort of thing before?
L188035	u856	m54	THORFINN	Don't you FEEL it?
L188034	u840	m54	ERIK	It's not magic! It's just a trick!
L188028	u856	m54	THORFINN	I know. I know.
L188027	u840	m54	ERIK	But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
L188018	u856	m54	THORFINN	He wants to KILL us.
L188017	u840	m54	ERIK	I know!
L188016	u856	m54	THORFINN	Halfdan the Black's here!
L187860	u840	m54	ERIK	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
L187859	u856	m54	THORFINN	That's terrible!
L187828	u856	m54	THORFINN	"You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make ""friends""."
L187827	u840	m54	ERIK	What's wrong with making friends?
L187822	u840	m54	ERIK	No.
L187821	u856	m54	THORFINN	Let's hack her to pieces.
L187805	u856	m54	THORFINN	Very deep... usually...
L187804	u840	m54	ERIK	How deep IS the ocean?
L187755	u840	m54	ERIK	It saved my father!
L187754	u856	m54	THORFINN	Erik! Row! What are you doing?
L187698	u840	m54	ERIK	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
L187697	u856	m54	THORFINN	It's Halfdan the Black!
L187694	u840	m54	ERIK	Come on, move it!
L187693	u856	m54	THORFINN	What are you talking about?
L187650	u840	m54	ERIK	He was lucky...  Sit there.
L187649	u856	m54	THORFINN	Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
L187505	u840	m54	ERIK	What?
L187504	u856	m54	THORFINN	But...
L187503	u840	m54	ERIK	But what?
L187497	u840	m54	ERIK	Find it... AND cross it!
L187496	u856	m54	THORFINN	FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
L187438	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	That's my boy!
L187437	u840	m54	ERIK	I... I... KILLED her...
L187436	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	So? What'd you do to her?
L187435	u840	m54	ERIK	She got me thinking...
L187434	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	It's always the women that start the trouble.
L187433	u840	m54	ERIK	I met this girl...
L187432	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	Who have you been talking to?
L187431	u840	m54	ERIK	Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
L187430	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	You talking piffle, son?
L187429	u840	m54	ERIK	We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
L187428	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	What?
L187427	u840	m54	ERIK	What's it all about?
L187426	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	We're missing all the fun...
L187745	u847	m54	IVAR	Make your mind up.
L187744	u840	m54	ERIK	Faster!
L187739	u847	m54	IVAR	Sorry!
L187738	u840	m54	ERIK	Slower! In... Out...
L187733	u847	m54	IVAR	Sorry.
L187732	u840	m54	ERIK	Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
L187709	u840	m54	ERIK	Row! Row! Row!
L187708	u847	m54	IVAR	I want to die...  No, I don't!
L187646	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, you ARE!
L187645	u847	m54	IVAR	He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
L188169	u840	m54	ERIK	Look out!
L188168	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	What did he say?
L188066	u840	m54	ERIK	You'll see!
L188065	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	"What ""magic"" have you brought, Erik?"
L188031	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
L188030	u840	m54	ERIK	"What ""magic""?"
L188029	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	It's magic.
L187811	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	The sun! That's it!
L187810	u840	m54	ERIK	Look, the sky is blue...
L187752	u840	m54	ERIK	ROW!
L187751	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	SHUT UP!
L187656	u840	m54	ERIK	Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
L187655	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
L187642	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	You may need a real Berserk.
L187641	u840	m54	ERIK	What are YOU doing here?
L188357	u852	m54	ODIN	Look... Erik...
L188356	u840	m54	ERIK	But you're the Gods!
L188355	u852	m54	ODIN	Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
L188351	u840	m54	ERIK	Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
L188350	u852	m54	ODIN	So?
L188349	u840	m54	ERIK	Because... you're... you're the Gods....
L188348	u852	m54	ODIN	Why should WE care?
L188347	u840	m54	ERIK	Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
L188346	u852	m54	ODIN	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
L188345	u840	m54	ERIK	You must help us.
L188394	u853	m54	SNORRI	No! Arrgh!
L188393	u840	m54	ERIK	You'll be sucked down too!
L188392	u853	m54	SNORRI	I've got you!
L188391	u840	m54	ERIK	No! Let go, Snorri!
L188129	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... I feel a little... oh...
L188128	u853	m54	SNORRI	Weren't we supposed to?
L188060	u840	m54	ERIK	To the oars!
L188059	u853	m54	SNORRI	A magic dishcloth.
L187791	u853	m54	SNORRI	Like fish.
L187790	u840	m54	ERIK	Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
L187786	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, come on!
L187785	u853	m54	SNORRI	First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
L187760	u853	m54	SNORRI	Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
L187759	u840	m54	ERIK	Row!
L187658	u853	m54	SNORRI	Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
L187657	u840	m54	ERIK	That's better.
L187653	u853	m54	SNORRI	Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
L187652	u840	m54	ERIK	That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
L187651	u853	m54	SNORRI	You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
L187640	u853	m54	SNORRI	Trust me to get the missionary.
L187639	u840	m54	ERIK	Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
L187638	u853	m54	SNORRI	It's SO nice to feel wanted.
L187637	u840	m54	ERIK	Now stop it!
L187636	u853	m54	SNORRI	Thank you VERY much indeed.
L187509	u840	m54	ERIK	No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
L187508	u853	m54	SNORRI	You mean we'd be dead?
L187611	u843	m54	GRANDAD	No, don't say anything else!
L187610	u840	m54	ERIK	Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
L187609	u843	m54	GRANDAD	I think we should go...
L187604	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
L187603	u843	m54	GRANDAD	Just say something cheerful.
L187602	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter with them?
L187595	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... er... yes...
L187594	u843	m54	GRANDAD	You need to say a bit more than that!
L187490	u840	m54	ERIK	Nobody gets killed.
L187489	u843	m54	GRANDAD	Who gets killed?
L187488	u840	m54	ERIK	There is another way.
L188247	u840	m54	ERIK	What are you talking about?
L188246	u848	m54	KEITEL	Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
L188058	u848	m54	KEITEL	What is it?
L188057	u840	m54	ERIK	So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
L187824	u840	m54	ERIK	How about making friends?
L187823	u848	m54	KEITEL	Well, what else do we do?
L187705	u848	m54	KEITEL	But...
L187704	u840	m54	ERIK	And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
L187701	u848	m54	KEITEL	But how could he know... unless...
L187700	u840	m54	ERIK	What do you think?
L187648	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter with Bjorn?
L187647	u848	m54	KEITEL	Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
L187613	u840	m54	ERIK	Keitel Blacksmith?
L187612	u848	m54	KEITEL	Wait, Erik!
L188306	u840	m54	ERIK	I have to go...
L188305	u854	m54	SVEN	I came to find my grandfather.
L188231	u854	m54	SVEN	Let me do something for myself for a change!
L188230	u840	m54	ERIK	Sven!
L188223	u854	m54	SVEN	Over the Edge of the World.
L188222	u840	m54	ERIK	We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
L187838	u840	m54	ERIK	Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
L187837	u854	m54	SVEN	Hy-Brasil?
L187818	u840	m54	ERIK	She MUST have a knife or something...
L187817	u854	m54	SVEN	She hasn't got any.
L187750	u854	m54	SVEN	DEATH!
L187749	u840	m54	ERIK	ROW!
L187644	u840	m54	ERIK	We haven't got a spare place.
L187643	u854	m54	SVEN	I AM one, Dad!
L187635	u854	m54	SVEN	I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
L187634	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
L187633	u854	m54	SVEN	Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
L187632	u840	m54	ERIK	It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
L187631	u854	m54	SVEN	Look, I bagged it last week.
L187627	u854	m54	SVEN	I was sitting there.
L187626	u840	m54	ERIK	Hey, you two! What's going on?
L187511	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
L187510	u854	m54	SVEN	But HOW?
L187507	u840	m54	ERIK	We'd be the first!
L187506	u854	m54	SVEN	Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
L187501	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
L187500	u854	m54	SVEN	Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
L187495	u840	m54	ERIK	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
L187494	u854	m54	SVEN	What are you talking about, Erik?
L187479	u854	m54	SVEN	I will join my grandfather there.
L187478	u840	m54	ERIK	And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
L187584	u842	m54	GIRL	Please.
L187583	u850	m54	LEIF	That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
L187581	u842	m54	GIRL	What d'you expect me to do?
L187580	u850	m54	LEIF	You will wait?
L187579	u842	m54	GIRL	Yeah... well...
L187578	u850	m54	LEIF	Bye... sorry...
L187577	u842	m54	GIRL	Bye, Leif.
L188075	u845	m54	HARALD	Well, where is he then?
L188074	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	He hasn't.
L188073	u845	m54	HARALD	Vanish into thin air?
L188072	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Do what?
L188071	u845	m54	HARALD	How did he do that?
L187798	u845	m54	HARALD	Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
L187797	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	What do we have to do?
L187796	u845	m54	HARALD	It can't do you any HARM...
L187735	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	The Dragon...
L187734	u845	m54	HARALD	What's all the panic about?
L187674	u853	m54	SNORRI	I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
L187673	u845	m54	HARALD	"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""
L187672	u853	m54	SNORRI	Your lord.
L187671	u845	m54	HARALD	You know, my son, our lord said...
L187592	u845	m54	HARALD	No, it is NOT.
L187591	u853	m54	SNORRI	Same thing, isn't it?
L187590	u845	m54	HARALD	Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
L187589	u853	m54	SNORRI	There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
L187588	u845	m54	HARALD	Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
L187587	u853	m54	SNORRI	You're wasting your time.
L187586	u845	m54	HARALD	I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
L187585	u853	m54	SNORRI	You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
L188403	u856	m54	THORFINN	Mum! Dad!
L188402	u847	m54	IVAR	Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
L188055	u856	m54	THORFINN	Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
L188054	u847	m54	IVAR	That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
L188053	u856	m54	THORFINN	And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
L188026	u847	m54	IVAR	That's it!
L188025	u856	m54	THORFINN	Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
L187690	u847	m54	IVAR	Bastard.
L187689	u856	m54	THORFINN	He used to puke in his sleep.
L187688	u847	m54	IVAR	Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
L187687	u856	m54	THORFINN	Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
L187686	u847	m54	IVAR	I know. I know.
L187685	u856	m54	THORFINN	I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
L187684	u847	m54	IVAR	How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
L187683	u856	m54	THORFINN	You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
L187682	u847	m54	IVAR	No, I'm not.
L187681	u856	m54	THORFINN	Are you all right?
L187784	u854	m54	SVEN	Hang on...
L187783	u848	m54	KEITEL	For your own sake... For the others... I...
L187782	u854	m54	SVEN	I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
L187781	u848	m54	KEITEL	I'm not worth risking your life for.
L187780	u854	m54	SVEN	What are you talking about?
L187779	u848	m54	KEITEL	Let me go, Sven.
L187778	u854	m54	SVEN	Got you!
L187777	u848	m54	KEITEL	Aaagh!
L188164	u853	m54	SNORRI	What have you got there?
L188163	u848	m54	KEITEL	Get away, Snorri.
L188162	u853	m54	SNORRI	What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
L188161	u848	m54	KEITEL	What?
L188157	u853	m54	SNORRI	Oh...
L188156	u848	m54	KEITEL	It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
L188155	u853	m54	SNORRI	Who's that?
L188096	u848	m54	KEITEL	I... I...
L188095	u853	m54	SNORRI	Well! Come on!
L188372	u848	m54	KEITEL	It's not my business any more!
L188371	u851	m54	LOKI	By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
L188370	u848	m54	KEITEL	Made by YOU, Loki!
L188256	u848	m54	KEITEL	Like you got rid of Snorri!
L188255	u851	m54	LOKI	I should have got rid of you long ago!
L188254	u851	m54	LOKI	You fool!
L188253	u848	m54	KEITEL	We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
L188252	u851	m54	LOKI	You've lost your mind.
L188251	u848	m54	KEITEL	No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
L188250	u851	m54	LOKI	Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
L188249	u848	m54	KEITEL	She knows it was our fault!
L188248	u851	m54	LOKI	Shut up!
L188200	u851	m54	LOKI	Help!
L188199	u848	m54	KEITEL	Help!
L188198	u848	m54	KEITEL	You'll drown us bo...
L188197	u851	m54	LOKI	Help!
L188196	u848	m54	KEITEL	Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
L188194	u851	m54	LOKI	I'm drowning! Help!
L188193	u848	m54	KEITEL	Relax!
L188192	u851	m54	LOKI	I can't swim! I can't swim!
L188149	u851	m54	LOKI	You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
L188148	u848	m54	KEITEL	YOU do it!
L188147	u851	m54	LOKI	Sh! Hurry!
L188144	u848	m54	KEITEL	How can we stops him now?
L188143	u851	m54	LOKI	Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
L188120	u848	m54	KEITEL	Well... I... I thought...
L188119	u851	m54	LOKI	Wasn't it, Keitel?
L187549	u851	m54	LOKI	You can't let Erik do THAT.
L187548	u848	m54	KEITEL	Together we stand!
L187547	u851	m54	LOKI	Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
L187546	u848	m54	KEITEL	The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
L187545	u851	m54	LOKI	That's right.
L187544	u848	m54	KEITEL	My brother blacksmiths!
L187543	u851	m54	LOKI	It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
L187542	u848	m54	KEITEL	The bottom falls out of the sword business!
L187541	u851	m54	LOKI	The Age of Ragnarok ends...
L187540	u848	m54	KEITEL	They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
L187539	u851	m54	LOKI	But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
L187538	u848	m54	KEITEL	Can't make enough axe-heads!
L187537	u848	m54	KEITEL	Can't make enough swords!
L187536	u851	m54	LOKI	If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
L187535	u851	m54	LOKI	"Yes yes... of course.... the ""Blacksmith's Code""..."
L187534	u848	m54	KEITEL	Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
L187533	u851	m54	LOKI	You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
L187532	u851	m54	LOKI	You could charge him what you like.
L187531	u848	m54	KEITEL	Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
L187530	u851	m54	LOKI	Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
L188367	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I hate you! I hate you!
L188366	u854	m54	SVEN	Dad!
L188365	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."
L188364	u854	m54	SVEN	Easy, Dad!
L188363	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	He drove me mad!
L188274	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Helpless...
L188273	u854	m54	SVEN	There is nothing we can do...
L188104	u854	m54	SVEN	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
L188103	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Well, go on! Go berserk!
L188091	u854	m54	SVEN	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
L188090	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
L187895	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Sh!
L187894	u854	m54	SVEN	Well, of course he is!
L187758	u854	m54	SVEN	DEATH TO DRAGONS!
L187757	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	HOLD it! HOLD it in!
L187748	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Stop it!
L187747	u854	m54	SVEN	KILL! KILL!
L187743	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
L187742	u854	m54	SVEN	I must KILL! Kill!
L187741	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Not now, Sven...
L187740	u854	m54	SVEN	We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
L187573	u854	m54	SVEN	I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
L187572	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
L187571	u854	m54	SVEN	I must only let the red rage...
L187570	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
L187569	u854	m54	SVEN	But it's a responsibility...
L187568	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	So did my father and his father before him.
L187567	u854	m54	SVEN	So did your father...
L187566	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
L187565	u854	m54	SVEN	You went berserk...
L187564	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
L187563	u854	m54	SVEN	I know, Dad.
L187562	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	It's a tradition.
L188112	u854	m54	SVEN	Tell him I'm coming!
L188111	u856	m54	THORFINN	No... he's not... not... there...
L188110	u854	m54	SVEN	You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
L188109	u856	m54	THORFINN	I'm not frightened... of anything...
L188108	u854	m54	SVEN	Thorfinn! You can't die!
L187793	u856	m54	THORFINN	Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
L187792	u854	m54	SVEN	Shut up.
L187519	u856	m54	THORFINN	Me too.
L187518	u854	m54	SVEN	Well... I'm game.
L187513	u854	m54	SVEN	Neither am I.
L187512	u856	m54	THORFINN	Well I'M certainly not, either.
L187481	u854	m54	SVEN	You liar!
L187480	u856	m54	THORFINN	He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
L187561	u856	m54	THORFINN	I never do...
L187560	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
L187557	u856	m54	THORFINN	Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
L187556	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And keep your sword greased.
L187555	u856	m54	THORFINN	No, Mother.
L187554	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
L187553	u856	m54	THORFINN	Yes, Mum.
L187552	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And something to sharpen them with?
L187551	u856	m54	THORFINN	Yes, Mother.
L187550	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And you've got BOTH axes?
L203901	u890	m58	BEN	I like the sound of that.
L203900	u889	m58	ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
L203694	u889	m58	ALICIA	My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
L203693	u890	m58	BEN	Those yours too?
L203692	u890	m58	BEN	No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
L203691	u889	m58	ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
L203690	u890	m58	BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
L203689	u889	m58	ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
L203688	u890	m58	BEN	How'd you know it was me?
L203562	u890	m58	BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
L203561	u889	m58	ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
L203558	u890	m58	BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
L203557	u889	m58	ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
L203702	u889	m58	ALICIA	Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
L203701	u898	m58	THE THING	I mean...
L203700	u889	m58	ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
L203699	u898	m58	THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
L203697	u898	m58	THE THING	This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
L203696	u889	m58	ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
L203695	u898	m58	THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
L203830	u890	m58	BEN	Victor must've taken him.
L203829	u897	m58	SUE	Where is Reed?
L203647	u897	m58	SUE	No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
L203646	u890	m58	BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
L203645	u897	m58	SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
L203644	u890	m58	BEN	It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
L203643	u897	m58	SUE	He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
L203604	u897	m58	SUE	What did he do to the uniform?!
L203603	u890	m58	BEN	Oh, he did.
L203602	u897	m58	SUE	He didn't.
L203501	u890	m58	BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
L203500	u897	m58	SUE	The suit will stretch. You should try it --
L203499	u890	m58	BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
L203450	u890	m58	BEN	Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
L203449	u897	m58	SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
L203265	u890	m58	BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
L203264	u897	m58	SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
L203128	u890	m58	BEN	Is it safe?
L203127	u897	m58	SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
L203091	u897	m58	SUE	Victor did.
L203090	u890	m58	BEN	I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
L203073	u897	m58	SUE	I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
L203072	u890	m58	BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
L203798	u890	m58	BEN	And you can? Power it up?
L203797	u899	m58	VICTOR	"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
L203796	u899	m58	VICTOR	He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
L203795	u890	m58	BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
L203794	u899	m58	VICTOR	To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
L203793	u890	m58	BEN	What do you want, Vic?
L203790	u899	m58	VICTOR	Where do you think? With Sue.
L203789	u890	m58	BEN	What is this? Where's Reed?
L203788	u899	m58	VICTOR	Ben, come in.
L203738	u899	m58	VICTOR	Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
L203737	u890	m58	BEN	About me? How sweet.
L203736	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
L203735	u890	m58	BEN	What are you doing here?
L203546	u890	m58	BEN	I already got it. Everything I want.
L203545	u891	m58	DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
L203330	u890	m58	BEN	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
L203329	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
L203328	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.
L203327	u890	m58	BEN	"Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
L203326	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Ben?
L203324	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
L203323	u890	m58	BEN	Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
L203114	u891	m58	DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
L203113	u890	m58	BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
L203112	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
L203111	u890	m58	BEN	I'll be watching over you.
L203898	u890	m58	BEN	Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
L203897	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
L203888	u890	m58	BEN	Got it, teach.
L203887	u895	m58	REED	Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
L203754	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
L203753	u890	m58	BEN	"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
L203751	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
L203750	u895	m58	REED	We're working as hard as we can --
L203749	u890	m58	BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
L203748	u895	m58	REED	Ben --
L203629	u895	m58	REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
L203628	u890	m58	BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
L203468	u895	m58	REED	O-kay. We'll skip that question.
L203467	u890	m58	BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
L203466	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
L203465	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
L203464	u895	m58	REED	Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
L203448	u895	m58	REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
L203447	u890	m58	BEN	You got a chisel round here?
L203413	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.
L203412	u895	m58	REED	We had a tough year.
L203368	u890	m58	BEN	Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
L203367	u895	m58	REED	Ben. Are you okay?
L203366	u890	m58	BEN	What the --!
L203270	u890	m58	BEN	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
L203269	u895	m58	REED	Are you alright?
L203242	u890	m58	BEN	Well maybe you should date him.
L203241	u895	m58	REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
L203240	u890	m58	BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
L203239	u895	m58	REED	What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
L203238	u890	m58	BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
L203237	u895	m58	REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
L203236	u890	m58	BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
L203234	u895	m58	REED	I should have done more, run more tests --
L203233	u890	m58	BEN	Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
L203232	u895	m58	REED	I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
L203230	u890	m58	BEN	Solid.
L203229	u895	m58	REED	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
L203228	u890	m58	BEN	How long was I out?
L203164	u895	m58	REED	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
L203163	u890	m58	BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
L203130	u890	m58	BEN	Should?
L203129	u895	m58	REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
L203110	u895	m58	REED	Victor's better at these things.
L203109	u890	m58	BEN	This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
L203108	u895	m58	REED	He's made a few changes.
L203107	u890	m58	BEN	Isn't that your speech?
L203087	u890	m58	BEN	This makes five.
L203086	u895	m58	REED	I had it at four.
L203085	u890	m58	BEN	Five times.
L203084	u895	m58	REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
L203083	u895	m58	REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.
L203082	u890	m58	BEN	They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
L203081	u895	m58	REED	Youthful high spirits.
L203080	u890	m58	BEN	No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
L203079	u895	m58	REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
L203078	u890	m58	BEN	Can't do it. I cannot do it.
L203066	u890	m58	BEN	I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
L203065	u895	m58	REED	We got what we wanted. That's enough.
L203064	u890	m58	BEN	Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
L203063	u895	m58	REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
L203062	u890	m58	BEN	He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
L203053	u895	m58	REED	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
L203052	u890	m58	BEN	What about his first born?
L203038	u895	m58	REED	Ben. This is business. Just work.
L203037	u890	m58	BEN	I can't take this.
L203022	u890	m58	BEN	You'd never know it.
L203021	u895	m58	REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
L203020	u895	m58	REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
L203019	u890	m58	BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
L203911	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
L203910	u890	m58	BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
L203828	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
L203827	u890	m58	BEN	The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
L203765	u890	m58	BEN	Go back to the drawing board.
L203764	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Hey! That's a prototype!
L203196	u890	m58	BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!
L203195	u893	m58	JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
L203194	u890	m58	BEN	Give me a mirror...
L203193	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
L203192	u890	m58	BEN	What's wrong with me?
L203191	u893	m58	JOHNNY	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
L203190	u890	m58	BEN	Reed?... Sue?
L203189	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
L203188	u890	m58	BEN	Where... where am I?
L203144	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.
L203143	u890	m58	BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
L203142	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
L203141	u890	m58	BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
L203140	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
L203139	u890	m58	BEN	'Course not. Strictly business.
L203138	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
L203122	u890	m58	BEN	Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
L203121	u893	m58	JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
L203116	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
L203115	u890	m58	BEN	What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
L203519	u899	m58	VICTOR	That's terrible news...
L203518	u892	m58	DOCTOR	But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
L203516	u892	m58	DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
L203515	u899	m58	VICTOR	What?
L203514	u892	m58	DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
L203513	u899	m58	VICTOR	"What do you mean ""complete""?"
L203512	u892	m58	DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
L203511	u899	m58	VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
L203510	u892	m58	DOCTOR	I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
L203509	u899	m58	VICTOR	And they're changing into...
L203508	u892	m58	DOCTOR	Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
L203251	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	No: You're ON FIRE!
L203250	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Not this again --
L203249	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	You're on fire!
L203248	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	Last one down springs for room service.
L203247	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I though we went over this.
L203246	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	Stay right. Left is trouble.
L203245	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Me like-y.
L203227	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
L203226	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
L203225	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
L203224	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
L203223	u893	m58	JOHNNY	So are you!
L203222	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	You're hot!
L203214	u893	m58	JOHNNY	"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --"
L203213	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	And where do we think we're going?
L203882	u895	m58	REED	Now.
L203881	u893	m58	JOHNNY	But all these people...
L203880	u895	m58	REED	Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
L203639	u895	m58	REED	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
L203638	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
L203637	u895	m58	REED	You need to control yourself and think before you --
L203550	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.
L203549	u895	m58	REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
L203503	u895	m58	REED	They're not costumes.
L203502	u893	m58	JOHNNY	He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
L203472	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
L203471	u895	m58	REED	What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
L203470	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
L203469	u895	m58	REED	Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
L203462	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
L203461	u895	m58	REED	Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
L203456	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I can go hotter!
L203455	u895	m58	REED	Back it down, Johnny!
L203426	u895	m58	REED	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
L203425	u893	m58	JOHNNY	This place is deluxe. You got cable?
L203424	u895	m58	REED	We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
L203415	u895	m58	REED	Oh, it is.
L203414	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
L203393	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
L203392	u895	m58	REED	Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
L203360	u895	m58	REED	You've been working out.
L203359	u893	m58	JOHNNY	This is wrong in so many ways.
L203304	u895	m58	REED	Ben, are you there?
L203303	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
L203295	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
L203294	u895	m58	REED	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
L203293	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Now what is up with that?
L203186	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Ben! Ben!
L203185	u895	m58	REED	He's not responsive --
L203179	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What about you?
L203178	u895	m58	REED	Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
L203840	u897	m58	SUE	But Johnny... you can't fly.
L203839	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
L203838	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing --
L203825	u897	m58	SUE	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
L203824	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
L203772	u897	m58	SUE	As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
L203771	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
L203770	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
L203769	u893	m58	JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
L203768	u897	m58	SUE	"Is that what you call it? ""Real""?"
L203767	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
L203766	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny? Did you see Ben?
L203635	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Blockhead started it!
L203634	u897	m58	SUE	You two need a time-out.
L203627	u897	m58	SUE	"You gave us names? What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
L203626	u893	m58	JOHNNY	You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
L203623	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Dude. That's my sister.
L203622	u897	m58	SUE	I'm driving.
L203610	u897	m58	SUE	Girl...?!
L203609	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
L203460	u897	m58	SUE	That's the temperature of the sun.
L203459	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Sweet.
L203458	u897	m58	SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
L203457	u893	m58	JOHNNY	You're really cramping my style here.
L203423	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
L203422	u897	m58	SUE	Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
L203421	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
L203310	u897	m58	SUE	I think that thing is Ben.
L203309	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What is that thing?
L203302	u893	m58	JOHNNY	"Okay, ""mom."""
L203301	u897	m58	SUE	Stop it.
L203300	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny.
L203299	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
L203297	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Please tell me you go silent too.
L203296	u897	m58	SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
L203093	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203092	u897	m58	SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L203336	u894	m58	LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
L203335	u899	m58	VICTOR	Front page?
L203334	u894	m58	LEONARD	Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L203333	u899	m58	VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
L203263	u899	m58	VICTOR	"That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not mine."""
L203262	u894	m58	LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
L203261	u899	m58	VICTOR	Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
L203260	u894	m58	LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L203259	u899	m58	VICTOR	And that's a good thing?
L203258	u894	m58	LEONARD	"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
L203257	u899	m58	VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L203256	u894	m58	LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L203255	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L203254	u894	m58	LEONARD	Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L203253	u899	m58	VICTOR	How's the IPO?
L203126	u894	m58	LEONARD	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
L203125	u899	m58	VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
L203104	u899	m58	VICTOR	History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203103	u894	m58	LEONARD	Then what is it?
L203102	u899	m58	VICTOR	It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
L203101	u894	m58	LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203100	u899	m58	VICTOR	Showtime.
L203099	u894	m58	LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
L203061	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203060	u894	m58	LEONARD	And if he's not...?
L203059	u899	m58	VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L203904	u897	m58	SUE	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
L203903	u895	m58	REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
L203885	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203884	u895	m58	REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L203779	u897	m58	SUE	You need a doctor.
L203778	u895	m58	REED	The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
L203777	u897	m58	SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L203776	u895	m58	REED	I can... make it work.
L203726	u897	m58	SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L203725	u895	m58	REED	Why didn't you say something?
L203724	u897	m58	SUE	When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L203723	u897	m58	SUE	I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
L203722	u895	m58	REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L203719	u897	m58	SUE	I gave him twenty.
L203718	u895	m58	REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L203717	u897	m58	SUE	Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L203716	u895	m58	REED	You were?
L203715	u897	m58	SUE	Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
L203714	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
L203713	u895	m58	REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L203682	u895	m58	REED	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L203681	u897	m58	SUE	Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
L203680	u895	m58	REED	Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
L203679	u897	m58	SUE	Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
L203678	u895	m58	REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L203677	u897	m58	SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L203596	u895	m58	REED	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
L203595	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. How close are we to a cure?
L203531	u895	m58	REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
L203530	u897	m58	SUE	And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
L203529	u895	m58	REED	Of course. Of course.
L203528	u897	m58	SUE	But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
L203527	u895	m58	REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L203526	u897	m58	SUE	And reverse the mutations --
L203525	u895	m58	REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L203524	u895	m58	REED	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L203523	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing?
L203494	u897	m58	SUE	No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L203493	u895	m58	REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
L203492	u897	m58	SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L203491	u895	m58	REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
L203490	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L203489	u895	m58	REED	No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
L203488	u897	m58	SUE	Are you kidding?
L203487	u895	m58	REED	I mean, you broke up with me, right?
L203486	u895	m58	REED	What in the world would give me that idea?
L203485	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L203483	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203482	u895	m58	REED	Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
L203481	u897	m58	SUE	Anger. Rage. Frustration.
L203480	u895	m58	REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L203479	u897	m58	SUE	Excuse me?
L203478	u895	m58	REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L203474	u897	m58	SUE	What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L203473	u895	m58	REED	"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge."
L203420	u897	m58	SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...
L203419	u895	m58	REED	That's what we're here to find out.
L203418	u897	m58	SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L203358	u897	m58	SUE	What...?  Oh.
L203357	u895	m58	REED	Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
L203355	u895	m58	REED	We need to get past them.
L203354	u897	m58	SUE	What?
L203292	u895	m58	REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
L203291	u897	m58	SUE	It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
L203289	u895	m58	REED	Sue... look at your hands.
L203288	u897	m58	SUE	What? What do you mean you --
L203287	u895	m58	REED	Uh, Sue...? I can't.
L203282	u897	m58	SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
L203281	u895	m58	REED	For science.
L203280	u895	m58	REED	Passion.
L203279	u897	m58	SUE	Which was?
L203278	u895	m58	REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
L203277	u897	m58	SUE	You're happy for me and Victor.
L203275	u897	m58	SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
L203274	u895	m58	REED	That's good. That's uh... good.
L203273	u897	m58	SUE	Yes, thanks.
L203272	u895	m58	REED	Feeling better?
L203096	u897	m58	SUE	Great minds think alike.
L203095	u895	m58	REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
L203077	u897	m58	SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
L203076	u895	m58	REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
L203075	u897	m58	SUE	It's been changed.
L203074	u895	m58	REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
L203071	u897	m58	SUE	Right. That's exactly what I meant.
L203070	u895	m58	REED	Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
L203069	u897	m58	SUE	I was talking about us. Working together.
L203068	u895	m58	REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
L203045	u897	m58	SUE	Never better.
L203044	u895	m58	REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
L203670	u899	m58	VICTOR	Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
L203669	u895	m58	REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
L203668	u899	m58	VICTOR	What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L203667	u895	m58	REED	What are you doing here?
L203443	u899	m58	VICTOR	I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
L203442	u895	m58	REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L203441	u899	m58	VICTOR	Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
L203440	u895	m58	REED	I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L203439	u899	m58	VICTOR	Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
L203436	u895	m58	REED	Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L203435	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L203316	u895	m58	REED	He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
L203315	u899	m58	VICTOR	Ben did this?
L203314	u895	m58	REED	Ben did this.
L203313	u899	m58	VICTOR	Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
L203172	u899	m58	VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L203171	u895	m58	REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
L203168	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.
L203167	u895	m58	REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
L203161	u899	m58	VICTOR	So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
L203160	u895	m58	REED	Ben's still out there --
L203159	u899	m58	VICTOR	Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
L203158	u895	m58	REED	We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
L203137	u895	m58	REED	Sure.
L203136	u899	m58	VICTOR	Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203058	u895	m58	REED	Hilarious.
L203057	u899	m58	VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203051	u899	m58	VICTOR	The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
L203050	u895	m58	REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203047	u895	m58	REED	Not at all.
L203046	u899	m58	VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203034	u895	m58	REED	You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
L203033	u899	m58	VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L203577	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
L203576	u899	m58	VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
L203575	u897	m58	SUE	Please don't make this personal --
L203574	u899	m58	VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
L203573	u897	m58	SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
L203572	u899	m58	VICTOR	Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L203571	u897	m58	SUE	He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L203569	u899	m58	VICTOR	Susan. What are you doing?
L203568	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L203567	u899	m58	VICTOR	It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
L203566	u897	m58	SUE	You said it was urgent.
L203431	u899	m58	VICTOR	Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
L203430	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L203429	u899	m58	VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
L203428	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, your scar --
L203319	u899	m58	VICTOR	Just find him.
L203318	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
L203312	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?
L203311	u899	m58	VICTOR	What's going on?
L203175	u897	m58	SUE	You can't leave them out there.
L203174	u899	m58	VICTOR	Raising the shields.
L203173	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing?
L203155	u899	m58	VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L203154	u897	m58	SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L203153	u899	m58	VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L203152	u897	m58	SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L203147	u899	m58	VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L203146	u897	m58	SUE	I understand the business reasons.
L203145	u899	m58	VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
L203041	u899	m58	VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
L203040	u897	m58	SUE	It's just business.
L203745	u898	m58	THE THING	Skeptical...?
L203744	u899	m58	VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
L203743	u898	m58	THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
L203742	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
L203741	u898	m58	THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
L203740	u899	m58	VICTOR	I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
L203739	u898	m58	THE THING	'Scuse me.
L229753	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
L229752	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Don't speak, Quellek.
L229751	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
L229750	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
L229749	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
L229748	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
L229746	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I'm... I'm shot.
L229745	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
L229740	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Open.
L229739	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
L229647	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
L229646	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
L229645	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Quellek. What are you doing in there?
L229644	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
L229345	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Right... Sorry, sir.
L229344	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Uh uh! What did we talk about?
L229343	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
L229342	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Thanks.
L229341	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
L229133	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
L229132	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Is that the bathroom?
L229131	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
L229130	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Where's my bed?
L229129	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
L229128	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	This is it?
L229127	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
L229126	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Just don't.
L229125	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
L229124	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
L229123	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
L229122	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Well good, that's very... nice.
L229121	u1047	m68	QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
L229847	u1042	m68	JASON	No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
L229846	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
L229784	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
L229783	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Yes. Good was done this .....
L229782	u1042	m68	JASON	~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
L229609	u1042	m68	JASON	I had the shot...
L229608	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
L229607	u1042	m68	JASON	"I was staying in character.  ""Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"""
L229606	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Purple skinned monstrosity...?
L229604	u1042	m68	JASON	Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
L229603	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
L229541	u1042	m68	JASON	Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
L229540	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  ""I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.."" ...""Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."""
L229539	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
L229538	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
L229537	u1042	m68	JASON	ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
L229530	u1042	m68	JASON	KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
L229529	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
L229512	u1042	m68	JASON	I heard something. A squeal.
L229511	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Nothing.
L229510	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  What?
L229465	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
L229464	u1042	m68	JASON	You go first! There's no time!
L229463	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Go ahead!
L229390	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Must be some sort of mining facility.
L229389	u1042	m68	JASON	There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
L229378	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	THIS much.
L229377	u1042	m68	JASON	What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
L229376	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	About this much.
L229291	u1042	m68	JASON	KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
L229290	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
L229289	u1042	m68	JASON	NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
L229272	u1042	m68	JASON	Like YOU know?
L229271	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
L229270	u1042	m68	JASON	We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
L229269	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	We've got to stop!
L229101	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
L229100	u1042	m68	JASON	At ease men.
L229093	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Just!?
L229092	u1042	m68	JASON	Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
L229044	u1042	m68	JASON	COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
L229043	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	God, what an ass.
L228944	u1042	m68	JASON	Leadership....
L228943	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
L228942	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
L228907	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	...Damn you!  Damn you!
L228906	u1042	m68	JASON	The show must go on.
L228905	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I won't and nothing you say-
L228904	u1042	m68	JASON	You WILL go out there.
L228899	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
L228898	u1042	m68	JASON	Come on, old friend...
L229423	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
L229422	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You have a better plan, Alex?
L229421	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
L229385	u1049	m68	TOMMY	...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
L229384	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	And note the sucked in gut.
L229368	u1049	m68	TOMMY	"Hey, watch that ""Laredo"" shit."
L229367	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"You think you could do better ""Laredo?"""
L229366	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
L229365	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Shut up.
L229364	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You were holding it upside down weren't you?
L229294	u1049	m68	TOMMY	The engines are dead. We're drifting.
L229293	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	What's happened?
L229283	u1049	m68	TOMMY	They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
L229282	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
L229214	u1049	m68	TOMMY	No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
L229213	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He wants to THINK!?
L229089	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Jason, what have you gotten us into?
L229088	u1049	m68	TOMMY	What the hell is going on?!!?
L228877	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
L228876	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Settle down, Alex...
L228873	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I played Richard III...
L228872	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Not again...
L228861	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
L228860	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He's a twit!
L229890	u1041	m68	GWEN	He always has to make the big entrance.
L229487	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Yes you did.
L229486	u1041	m68	GWEN	No I didn't.
L229485	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"Back there. You said ""the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."""
L229484	u1041	m68	GWEN	What?
L229483	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"You said ""the Commander."
L229470	u1041	m68	GWEN	Down there.
L229469	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
L229448	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
L229447	u1041	m68	GWEN	Those blue things ate everybody here?
L229432	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Nobody was WATCHING?
L229431	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know.
L229395	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Could they be the miners?
L229394	u1041	m68	GWEN	Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
L229303	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	To see if there's a pub.
L229302	u1041	m68	GWEN	Alex? Where are you going?
L229301	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	"Go into the cloud! ...
L229288	u1041	m68	GWEN	FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
L229287	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
L229279	u1041	m68	GWEN	The ships are gaining...
L229278	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	May I get the check?
L229267	u1041	m68	GWEN	Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
L229266	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	We heard it the first time!
L229085	u1041	m68	GWEN	All this from watching the.. historical records?
L229084	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh my god, It's real.
L228979	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
L228978	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
L228977	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	A boy comes to the door.
L228976	u1041	m68	GWEN	You could order something in.
L228975	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
L228974	u1041	m68	GWEN	Why didn't you stop at the market?
L228973	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
L228897	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh can't I? Watch me!
L228896	u1041	m68	GWEN	Alex you can't -just leave.
L228871	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Dear God.... How did I come to this?
L228870	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
L228865	u1041	m68	GWEN	The guy is terminally selfish!
L228864	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He's a miserable twit!
L229659	u1037	m68	BRANDON	We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
L229658	u1043	m68	KYLE	I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
L229657	u1037	m68	BRANDON	You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
L229656	u1043	m68	KYLE	Oh.  Okay.
L229655	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
L229654	u1043	m68	KYLE	Hi Brandon.
L229036	u1037	m68	BRANDON	He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
L229035	u1043	m68	KYLE	He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
L229765	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
L229764	u1042	m68	JASON	That's It?
L229763	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Raise the glass and push the blue button.
L229762	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
L229730	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
L229729	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  Up?
L229728	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Up.
L229727	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Go. They're off again.
L229725	u1037	m68	BRANDON	GO Commander.
L229724	u1042	m68	JASON	Shit! Go!
L229723	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Lt. Madison, GO.
L229722	u1042	m68	JASON	No, wait, are you-
L229721	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Wait two seconds then go.
L229720	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, now. But-
L229719	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
L229707	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
L229706	u1042	m68	JASON	BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
L229700	u1037	m68	BRANDON	My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
L229699	u1042	m68	JASON	How did you come to that conclusion?
L229698	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
L229697	u1042	m68	JASON	But you don't?
L229696	u1037	m68	BRANDON	It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
L229695	u1042	m68	JASON	What do you mean?
L229694	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
L229693	u1042	m68	JASON	What does the Omega 13 do?
L229692	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander?
L229691	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
L229670	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, that's where you want to be.
L229669	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes...?
L229668	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT?"" Should be down at the far end to your left."
L229667	u1042	m68	JASON	We'd never have the budget for this.
L229666	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
L229665	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
L229664	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay...  Okay, now what.
L229663	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
L229653	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
L229652	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, we got it.
L229642	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
L229641	u1037	m68	BRANDON	I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
L229640	u1042	m68	JASON	It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
L229639	u1037	m68	BRANDON	... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
L229638	u1042	m68	JASON	It's okay. Listen-
L229637	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
L229636	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
L229635	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Brandon.
L229634	u1042	m68	JASON	What's  your name, son?
L229633	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
L229632	u1042	m68	JASON	We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
L229631	u1037	m68	BRANDON	... Yes?
L228970	u1042	m68	JASON	There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
L228969	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes but, we were wondering-
L228968	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
L228967	u1037	m68	BRANDON	"Commander, as I was saying... In ""The Quasar Dilemma"", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?"
L228949	u1042	m68	JASON	Excuse me guys.
L228948	u1037	m68	BRANDON	"Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In ""The Quasar Dilemma"", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-"
L229856	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Systems register functional.
L229843	u1041	m68	GWEN	All systems are working, Commander.
L229842	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Systems register functional.
L229317	u1041	m68	GWEN	No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
L229316	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
L229311	u1041	m68	GWEN	We need another one.
L229310	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
L229307	u1041	m68	GWEN	It's fractured...
L229306	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
L229305	u1041	m68	GWEN	Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
L229265	u1041	m68	GWEN	The enemy is matching velocity.
L229264	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	The enemy is matching velocity.
L229257	u1041	m68	GWEN	Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
L229256	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	The ship is sustaining structural damage.
L229142	u1041	m68	GWEN	I never get tired of that joke.
L229141	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	There is no weather in space.
L229140	u1041	m68	GWEN	What's the weather like outside?
L229139	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Yes?
L229138	u1041	m68	GWEN	"I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from ""historical document"" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?"
L228849	u1041	m68	GWEN	We're getting major structural damage.
L228848	u1038	m68	COMPUTER	Structural damage at 68 percent.
L229115	u1039	m68	FRED	OK!
L229114	u1046	m68	NERVOUS TECH	So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
L229113	u1039	m68	FRED	Covalent... Right. So...
L229112	u1046	m68	NERVOUS TECH	What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
L229111	u1039	m68	FRED	... What does that mean?
L229110	u1046	m68	NERVOUS TECH	That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
L229109	u1039	m68	FRED	U.... What do you think?
L229554	u1042	m68	JASON	Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
L229553	u1039	m68	FRED	As good as Hopkins?
L229549	u1039	m68	FRED	You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
L229548	u1042	m68	JASON	Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
L229546	u1042	m68	JASON	Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
L229545	u1039	m68	FRED	No, I'll kill you. .
L229498	u1042	m68	JASON	I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
L229497	u1039	m68	FRED	Right.
L229496	u1042	m68	JASON	The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
L229427	u1039	m68	FRED	No, no... I'll think on it...
L229426	u1042	m68	JASON	Never mind, Fred....
L229425	u1039	m68	FRED	A hologram...
L229339	u1042	m68	JASON	I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
L229338	u1039	m68	FRED	Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
L229678	u1039	m68	FRED	Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
L229677	u1040	m68	GUY	I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
L229676	u1039	m68	FRED	It's suicide.
L229675	u1040	m68	GUY	Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
L229674	u1039	m68	FRED	We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
L229481	u1040	m68	GUY	Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
L229480	u1039	m68	FRED	...The digital conveyor.
L229399	u1040	m68	GUY	I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
L229398	u1039	m68	FRED	You Okay, Alex?
L228930	u1039	m68	FRED	"Oh I make it up. Use lots of ""k""s and ""v""s."
L228929	u1040	m68	GUY	How do you remember this stuff?
L229416	u1040	m68	GUY	We're doing episode 31, Jason?
L229415	u1041	m68	GWEN	How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
L229408	u1041	m68	GWEN	Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
L229407	u1040	m68	GUY	I am SO SICK of being right.
L229401	u1040	m68	GUY	Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
L229400	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh, they're so cute.
L229392	u1040	m68	GUY	Something BAD happened here.
L229391	u1041	m68	GWEN	Where are the miners?
L229356	u1040	m68	GUY	"Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just ""CREWMAN #6""!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?"
L229355	u1041	m68	GWEN	Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
L229191	u1041	m68	GWEN	The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
L229190	u1040	m68	GUY	The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
L229082	u1040	m68	GUY	It's ... incredible.
L229081	u1041	m68	GWEN	THAT'S why you built this ship?
L229075	u1041	m68	GWEN	You... know us?
L229074	u1040	m68	GUY	Crewman #6... Call me Guy.
L228923	u1041	m68	GWEN	Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
L228922	u1040	m68	GUY	Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
L229808	u1042	m68	JASON	No. Keep all energy to the armor.
L229807	u1040	m68	GUY	We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
L229536	u1042	m68	JASON	A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
L229535	u1040	m68	GUY	I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
L229420	u1040	m68	GUY	BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
L229419	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
L229418	u1040	m68	GUY	Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
L229417	u1042	m68	JASON	It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
L229388	u1042	m68	JASON	Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
L229387	u1040	m68	GUY	That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
L229370	u1042	m68	JASON	All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
L229369	u1040	m68	GUY	We're screwed... We're so screwed...
L229354	u1040	m68	GUY	No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
L229353	u1042	m68	JASON	It's... I don't know.
L229352	u1040	m68	GUY	Yeah, what is it?
L229351	u1042	m68	JASON	Your last name.
L229350	u1040	m68	GUY	Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
L229349	u1042	m68	JASON	Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
L229261	u1042	m68	JASON	"We should have a turbo. I'm always saying ""activate turbo boosters"", right?..."
L229260	u1040	m68	GUY	They're still behind us...
L229240	u1042	m68	JASON	All right. Put me back on with him.
L229239	u1040	m68	GUY	...Okay
L229854	u1049	m68	TOMMY	We made it. Commander, we made it.'
L229853	u1040	m68	GUY	~e're alive!
L229841	u1049	m68	TOMMY	We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
L229840	u1040	m68	GUY	We're alive!
L229442	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I think he just likes pointing at things.
L229441	u1040	m68	GUY	Not a clue. You?
L229440	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
L229430	u1040	m68	GUY	Where'd they go? Back inside?
L229429	u1049	m68	TOMMY	They're gone.
L229414	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
L229413	u1040	m68	GUY	We're doing episode 31?
L229412	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Assault on Voltareck III.  Episode... 31 I think.
L229174	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Hey, YOU want to drive?
L229173	u1040	m68	GUY	More to the left... Stay parallel...
L228921	u1040	m68	GUY	"Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  ""Crewman #6?"""
L228920	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
L228919	u1040	m68	GUY	Hi everybody.
L229824	u1042	m68	JASON	TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
L229823	u1041	m68	GWEN	never doubted you for a second.
L229814	u1042	m68	JASON	Mark 12.
L229813	u1041	m68	GWEN	He's accelerating to Mark 6.
L229718	u1041	m68	GWEN	Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
L229717	u1042	m68	JASON	Because it was on the show!
L229716	u1041	m68	GWEN	We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
L229715	u1042	m68	JASON	Gwen...
L229714	u1041	m68	GWEN	What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
L229651	u1041	m68	GWEN	Wait... Jason, Here!...
L229650	u1042	m68	JASON	There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
L229623	u1042	m68	JASON	No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
L229622	u1041	m68	GWEN	Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
L229621	u1042	m68	JASON	Right.
L229620	u1041	m68	GWEN	So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
L229523	u1042	m68	JASON	What the hell are you talking about?
L229522	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
L229520	u1041	m68	GWEN	Turn on the translation circuit.
L229519	u1042	m68	JASON	Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
L229502	u1041	m68	GWEN	Nothing. Hold please.
L229501	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  What did he say?
L229495	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
L229494	u1042	m68	JASON	Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
L229493	u1041	m68	GWEN	Thank God. Are you okay?
L229492	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes. Yes, I'm here!
L229491	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason.. Can you hear me?
L229452	u1042	m68	JASON	Will you stop RIDING ME?!
L229451	u1041	m68	GWEN	Clenched jaw...
L229444	u1042	m68	JASON	It helps.
L229443	u1041	m68	GWEN	How does the rolling help, actually?
L229411	u1041	m68	GWEN	Why does this sound so familiar?
L229410	u1042	m68	JASON	All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
L229383	u1042	m68	JASON	Don't be ridiculous.
L229382	u1041	m68	GWEN	You're playing your good side.
L229373	u1041	m68	GWEN	I could have held on to YOU! ...
L229372	u1042	m68	JASON	Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
L229371	u1041	m68	GWEN	Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
L229315	u1041	m68	GWEN	Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
L229314	u1042	m68	JASON	Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
L229309	u1041	m68	GWEN	Computer, can it be repaired?
L229308	u1042	m68	JASON	Can it be repaired?
L229296	u1041	m68	GWEN	No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
L229295	u1042	m68	JASON	Are they behind us?
L229275	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't think that's a cloud...
L229274	u1042	m68	JASON	Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
L229245	u1042	m68	JASON	Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
L229244	u1041	m68	GWEN	"I thought It was the ""We're dead"" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???"
L229243	u1042	m68	JASON	I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
L229238	u1042	m68	JASON	You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
L229237	u1041	m68	GWEN	JASON...
L229236	u1042	m68	JASON	We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
L229235	u1041	m68	GWEN	Jason..
L229234	u1042	m68	JASON	All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
L229221	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
L229220	u1041	m68	GWEN	There's nobody here. Jason...
L229212	u1042	m68	JASON	Let me think. I need time to think.
L229211	u1041	m68	GWEN	We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
L229157	u1042	m68	JASON	Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
L229156	u1041	m68	GWEN	We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
L229155	u1042	m68	JASON	Hey... Hey where are you going?
L229154	u1041	m68	GWEN	Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
L229153	u1042	m68	JASON	It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
L229152	u1041	m68	GWEN	Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
L229151	u1042	m68	JASON	Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
L229150	u1041	m68	GWEN	Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
L229149	u1042	m68	JASON	Tell them? About...
L229148	u1041	m68	GWEN	Wait. When are you going to tell them?
L229147	u1042	m68	JASON	C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
L229146	u1041	m68	GWEN	On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
L229145	u1042	m68	JASON	But I'm the Commander!
L229144	u1041	m68	GWEN	Only answers to me.
L229143	u1042	m68	JASON	Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
L229137	u1042	m68	JASON	Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
L229136	u1041	m68	GWEN	One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
L229135	u1042	m68	JASON	It's Jason...
L229048	u1041	m68	GWEN	You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
L229047	u1042	m68	JASON	This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
L228955	u1042	m68	JASON	You smiled at me.
L228954	u1041	m68	GWEN	What?
L228891	u1042	m68	JASON	What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
L228890	u1041	m68	GWEN	How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
L228889	u1042	m68	JASON	A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
L229880	u1041	m68	GWEN	Tommy, look!  Those lights...
L229800	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Closer?  I can try.
L229799	u1049	m68	TOMMY	JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
L229489	u1041	m68	GWEN	Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
L229488	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I heard it too.
L229479	u1041	m68	GWEN	"Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... ""Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"""
L229478	u1049	m68	TOMMY	That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
L229477	u1041	m68	GWEN	We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
L229468	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
L229467	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
L229320	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Sure, no problem.
L229319	u1041	m68	GWEN	I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
L229318	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You know, that's really getting annoying.
L229054	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
L229053	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You should have let me hit him.
L229046	u1041	m68	GWEN	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
L229045	u1049	m68	TOMMY	That's it, It's go time.
L228941	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Almost as much as he loves himself.
L228940	u1041	m68	GWEN	You gotta admit, they do love him.
L228888	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You are so full of shit
L228887	u1041	m68	GWEN	Unbelievable.
L228863	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
L228862	u1041	m68	GWEN	You're kidding. When for?
L228859	u1041	m68	GWEN	This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
L228858	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
L229812	u1048	m68	SARRIS	This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
L229811	u1042	m68	JASON	Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
L229584	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
L229583	u1042	m68	JASON	We.. We lie.
L229582	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Simpler.
L229581	u1042	m68	JASON	We pretend...
L229580	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
L229579	u1042	m68	JASON	My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
L229575	u1042	m68	JASON	Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
L229574	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Explain -
L229573	u1042	m68	JASON	Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
L229572	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Wait. What did you say?
L229570	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
L229569	u1042	m68	JASON	No! I swear I don't know! Please!
L229568	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Prepare a tear harness for the female...
L229567	u1042	m68	JASON	Stop, please! I don't know!
L229566	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
L229565	u1042	m68	JASON	I don't know.
L229564	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
L229563	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes.
L229233	u1042	m68	JASON	All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
L229232	u1048	m68	SARRIS	You have ten seconds.
L229231	u1042	m68	JASON	Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
L229230	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
L229229	u1042	m68	JASON	Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
L229228	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
L229227	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
L229011	u1042	m68	JASON	Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
L229010	u1048	m68	SARRIS	First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
L229834	u1042	m68	JASON	You can oc that?
L229833	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
L229591	u1042	m68	JASON	It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
L229590	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But...Why?
L229589	u1042	m68	JASON	Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
L229588	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But... Inside, I have seen-
L229587	u1042	m68	JASON	A model, only as big as this.
L229586	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But there it is!...
L229585	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
L229336	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
L229335	u1042	m68	JASON	Well... Sort of...
L229334	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	"Deception... ""Lies."""
L229323	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
L229322	u1042	m68	JASON	You what?.. What are you talking about?
L229321	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
L229277	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
L229276	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar? What is that?
L229217	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
L229216	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander...
L229205	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
L229204	u1042	m68	JASON	Former Commander?
L229203	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Our former Commander was not... Strong.
L229202	u1042	m68	JASON	Then how did he find out about the device?
L229201	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	NO, Thank God he has not.
L229200	u1042	m68	JASON	Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
L229179	u1042	m68	JASON	Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
L229178	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
L229096	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	... Maintenance facility...
L229095	u1042	m68	JASON	It's perfectly safe. I promise.
L229094	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Weapons storage...
L229027	u1042	m68	JASON	It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
L229026	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
L229025	u1042	m68	JASON	Thanks
L229024	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	An interstellar vox.
L229023	u1042	m68	JASON	I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
L229022	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
L229021	u1042	m68	JASON	Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
L229020	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But what if Sarris survives?
L229019	u1042	m68	JASON	Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
L229018	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Theramin.
L229017	u1042	m68	JASON	Right. Long live... What's your planet?
L229016	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
L229015	u1042	m68	JASON	"Yeah. ""Earth."" Time to get back to ""Earth,"" kids."
L229014	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	You... You mean Earth?
L229013	u1042	m68	JASON	Home.
L229012	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander?... Where are you... going?
L229000	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	As you wish.
L228999	u1042	m68	JASON	Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
L228998	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
L228983	u1042	m68	JASON	Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
L228982	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
L228959	u1042	m68	JASON	Catch me later, okay?
L228958	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	I... certainly, but-
L228957	u1042	m68	JASON	Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
L228956	u1045	m68	MATHESAR	Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
L229879	u1049	m68	TOMMY	I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
L229878	u1042	m68	JASON	Hold course, Laredo!
L229839	u1042	m68	JASON	Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
L229838	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Commander?... Call me Laredo?
L229837	u1042	m68	JASON	Let's do it, Tommy.
L229794	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Pedal to the metal...
L229793	u1042	m68	JASON	Pedal to the metal Tommy...
L229618	u1042	m68	JASON	Practice driving, Tommy.
L229617	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Jason? What about me? What do I do?
L229616	u1042	m68	JASON	All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
L229558	u1042	m68	JASON	We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
L229557	u1049	m68	TOMMY	NO NO NO.
L229534	u1042	m68	JASON	It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
L229533	u1049	m68	TOMMY	The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
L229532	u1042	m68	JASON	It doesn't have eyes.
L229531	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
L229508	u1042	m68	JASON	Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
L229507	u1049	m68	TOMMY	How about the pig-lizard?
L229506	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay... On what?
L229461	u1042	m68	JASON	Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
L229460	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Sorry Guys... It just went off.
L229439	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, let's go.
L229438	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Oh, right, sorry.
L229437	u1042	m68	JASON	Tommy, we have these...
L229436	u1049	m68	TOMMY	"Okay, I'll do this...  ""Caw Caw!"""
L229435	u1042	m68	JASON	Anything.
L229434	u1049	m68	TOMMY	What kind of signal?
L229433	u1042	m68	JASON	All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
L229281	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Oh god...
L229280	u1042	m68	JASON	Do your best, Tommy...
L229263	u1042	m68	JASON	Push It. Hold it down.
L229262	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Could be this.
L229259	u1049	m68	TOMMY	It's as far as it goes!
L229258	u1042	m68	JASON	Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
L229254	u1042	m68	JASON	Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
L229253	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Where?
L229197	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Why don't you just turn it on and see?
L229196	u1042	m68	JASON	Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
L229170	u1042	m68	JASON	They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
L229169	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Excuse me?
L229161	u1042	m68	JASON	I think we're going to exit the space port.
L229160	u1049	m68	TOMMY	What's going on?
L229071	u1042	m68	JASON	Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
L229070	u1049	m68	TOMMY	Wh... Where are we?
L229069	u1042	m68	JASON	That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
L228946	u1042	m68	JASON	And determination.
L228945	u1049	m68	TOMMY	... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
L228886	u1042	m68	JASON	"I didn't say that.  I said ""wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together."" That's what I said."
L228885	u1049	m68	TOMMY	You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
L229806	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
L229805	u1044	m68	LATHE	Because they're coming right at us.
L229804	u1048	m68	SARRIS	WHAT? WH
L229803	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Get oacK on their tail.
L229802	u1044	m68	LATHE	enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
L229686	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Find them.
L229685	u1044	m68	LATHE	But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
L229684	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Find them.
L229595	u1044	m68	LATHE	The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
L229594	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
L229285	u1048	m68	SARRIS	Patience, Lt. . Patience.
L229284	u1044	m68	LATHE	Continue forward, sir?
L237795	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-careful, Abdullah-
L237794	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
L237793	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
L237792	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
L237791	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
L237790	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
L237744	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	As are they all.
L237743	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Morning, friend, glorious day.
L237732	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
L237731	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
L237730	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
L237729	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
L237728	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
L237727	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
L237700	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
L237699	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	There is no reason for fear.
L237698	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
L237697	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Let me see the sick.
L237696	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
L237695	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You were contracted to work-
L237817	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
L237816	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	How; we don't know where they are?
L237815	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Starting now, we attack them.
L237804	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	I think it's been a pleasure.
L237803	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
L237802	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
L237801	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Am I to take it you want to live?
L237800	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	I am a man of peace.
L237799	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
L237798	u1111	m73	ABDULLAH	You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
L237797	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	No hints, Samuel.
L237913	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-not a time for modesty, Bob-
L237912	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Understand, I had help-
L237779	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me. 
L237778	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
L237777	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
L237776	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
L237775	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
L237774	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
L237773	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
L237772	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	What?
L237771	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
L237770	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	And it worked?
L237769	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
L237768	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
L237767	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
L237766	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
L237765	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	"I'm calling it my ""contraption""- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door."
L237764	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
L237759	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
L237758	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	It hasn't been that simple so far.
L237757	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
L237756	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
L237749	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Well, I need to speak to him.
L237748	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Yes he is.
L237747	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
L237746	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Starling?
L237745	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	I do need to see Starling.
L237739	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	But overall, you're pleased?
L237738	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
L237737	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	So work must be going well?
L237736	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Don't they, though?
L237735	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Lovely sound- they seem happy.
L237734	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	How could it be? I hate Africa.
L237733	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Pleasant journey?
L237583	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
L237582	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
L237581	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
L237580	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
L237579	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	But I have in India- every country presents problems.
L237578	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	You've never built in Africa.
L237577	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
L237576	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
L237574	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
L237573	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
L237572	u1112	m73	BEAUMONT	John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
L237846	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	Then why do it?
L237845	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
L237844	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
L237646	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
L237645	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
L237641	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
L237640	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Then why do you stay?
L237639	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
L237691	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	"You intend ""sorting this out"" tonight?"
L237690	u1119	m73	STARLING	-please- you needn't be so graphic-
L237689	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
L237644	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
L237643	u1119	m73	STARLING	A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
L237636	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	Nigel and I don't like each other much.
L237635	u1119	m73	STARLING	You never had it.
L237634	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	"I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, ""don't get sick in front of it.""  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack."
L237823	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Then we agree. 
L237822	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
L237821	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
L237820	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
L237819	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
L237818	u1113	m73	HAWTHORNE	That's a terrible idea-
L237594	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
L237593	u1114	m73	HELENA	Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
L237592	u1114	m73	HELENA	"-not ""what if""- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our ""son"" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit."
L237591	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	What if there are complications?-
L237590	u1114	m73	HELENA	-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
L237589	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
L237588	u1114	m73	HELENA	Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
L237587	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
L237586	u1114	m73	HELENA	Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
L237585	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
L237584	u1114	m73	HELENA	I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
L237788	u1115	m73	MIDDLE COOLIE	I assure you we came close many times-
L237787	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
L237786	u1115	m73	MIDDLE COOLIE	-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
L237785	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
L237784	u1115	m73	MIDDLE COOLIE	That is correct.  Nothing.
L237783	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
L237782	u1115	m73	MIDDLE COOLIE	We have hunted since childhood.
L237781	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Very good indeed.
L237711	u1119	m73	STARLING	We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
L237710	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You mean nobody died?
L237709	u1119	m73	STARLING	What a good week.
L237703	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
L237702	u1119	m73	STARLING	-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
L237701	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Second death? Where?-
L237694	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	That's what the books say... 
L237693	u1119	m73	STARLING	But you said they were always old.
L237692	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
L237684	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
L237683	u1119	m73	STARLING	John, it will not be easy.
L237682	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
L237681	u1119	m73	STARLING	"You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -""there."""
L237680	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
L237676	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Possibly.
L237675	u1119	m73	STARLING	Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
L237674	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	How lucky we are.
L237673	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
L237672	u1119	m73	STARLING	With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
L237667	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	So that's what a lion looks like. 
L237666	u1119	m73	STARLING	...one shot...
L237665	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
L237664	u1119	m73	STARLING	Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
L237663	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	What?
L237662	u1119	m73	STARLING	John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
L237660	u1119	m73	STARLING	That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
L237659	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
L237658	u1119	m73	STARLING	I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
L237657	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Shhh.
L237656	u1119	m73	STARLING	I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
L237655	u1119	m73	STARLING	Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
L237654	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
L237653	u1119	m73	STARLING	I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
L237652	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Might be exciting for you.
L237651	u1119	m73	STARLING	I don't suppose I could watch.
L237650	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
L237649	u1119	m73	STARLING	"You said ""of course"" you'd need the donkey. Why ""of course""?"
L237648	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
L237647	u1119	m73	STARLING	"I couldn't believe it when you said ""sort it out."" As if it were the most normal thing in the world. ""Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."""
L237633	u1119	m73	STARLING	Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.
L237632	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
L237631	u1119	m73	STARLING	Finish your tour?
L237618	u1119	m73	STARLING	I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
L237617	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
L237613	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Does he speak English?
L237612	u1119	m73	STARLING	Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
L237611	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Have you got that in writing? 
L237610	u1119	m73	STARLING	We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
L237609	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
L237608	u1119	m73	STARLING	Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
L237607	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
L237606	u1119	m73	STARLING	I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
L237605	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
L237604	u1119	m73	STARLING	Anything special about them?
L237603	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
L237602	u1119	m73	STARLING	Don't much like them.
L237598	u1119	m73	STARLING	That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
L237597	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	"He just gave me his ""monster"" speech."
L237596	u1119	m73	STARLING	Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
L237920	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
L237919	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
L237918	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
L237908	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
L237907	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	How many do you think they've killed?
L237906	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Because I think they're after you.
L237905	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Why?
L237904	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Good luck.
L237903	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You think they'll come then?  Why?
L237902	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
L237901	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Was that supposed to make me feel better? 
L237900	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
L237899	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I'll have to.
L237898	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
L237897	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I'll be bait alone?
L237896	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
L237895	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
L237892	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Don't they have to be?...
L237891	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
L237888	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
L237887	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
L237885	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	I got big. 
L237884	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	What happened to them?
L237883	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
L237882	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
L237879	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
L237878	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	But of course yours worked.
L237877	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
L237876	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
L237875	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Goddammit!
L237874	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Only in life... 
L237873	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Have you ever failed?
L237872	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Think about something else.
L237865	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	...don't know...
L237864	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Has it ever done that before?
L237863	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	...misfire... it jammed...
L237858	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
L237857	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
L237856	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Samuel says you killed a lion.
L237855	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I can try.
L237854	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
L237839	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
L237838	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Have you got it?
L237828	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
L237827	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	That's very considerate.
L237826	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
L237814	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Somehow I guessed. 
L237813	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
L237812	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Actually, no.
L237811	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
L237810	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	We need to talk.
L237809	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
L237808	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Got me out of trouble.
L237807	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	What did I do?
L237806	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I didn't have a chance to thank you.
L237941	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
L237940	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Afraid of lions.
L237939	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Underneath.  Somewhere.
L237938	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Where is it?
L237932	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Once... 
L237931	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	He has children?
L237926	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
L237925	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
L237852	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
L237851	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
L237834	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Since his beard was red.
L237833	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You've known him long?
L237832	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Oh yes. But it takes time.
L237831	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	You like him, don't you?
L237825	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I have to ask- why do you need me?
L237824	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Soon. 
L237724	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	You give me hope, John. 
L237723	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I do, actually; very much.
L237722	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Do you love her?
L237721	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	I expect so- it's from my wife.
L237720	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Good news?
L237719	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Thank you, Samuel.
L237718	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	For you.
L237713	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
L237712	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Oh yes, I think so. 
L237705	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
L237704	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
L237688	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	"You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means ""slaughter""..."
L237687	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Nonsense.
L237686	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	You- they cannot believe you're still here.
L237685	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	What are they looking at?
L237638	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
L237637	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	I am also liaison between these two.
L237629	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	This is more difficult-
L237628	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Did it look like this in your mind?
L237625	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
L237624	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	The workers don't get on?
L237623	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
L237622	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
L237621	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
L237620	u1116	m73	PATTERSON	Why do the workers look unhappy?
L237930	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Hold your son high. 
L237929	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Some mysteries should not have solutions.
L237928	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
L237923	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Help finish the railroad.
L237922	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
L237921	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Where do you go next?
L237871	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
L237870	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	And where will you sleep beautifully?
L237869	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
L237862	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Not even close.  What happened?
L237861	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Did you ever see a lion that size?
L237841	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
L237840	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	Why so many?
L237837	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	They will want a lot of money.
L237836	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Four should do it.
L237835	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	How many cattle?
L237830	u1118	m73	SAMUEL	I don't believe you had a mother. 
L237829	u1117	m73	REDBEARD	Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
L239472	u1120	m74	DANA	I'd rather not.
L239471	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
L239470	u1120	m74	DANA	I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
L239469	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
L239468	u1120	m74	DANA	We don't have a relationship.
L239467	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
L239370	u1120	m74	DANA	I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
L239369	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
L239368	u1120	m74	DANA	Everybody has a choice.
L239367	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
L239366	u1120	m74	DANA	If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
L239365	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
L239364	u1120	m74	DANA	What do you want with my baby?
L239083	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
L239082	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
L238961	u1120	m74	DANA	Good night, Janosz.
L238960	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
L238959	u1120	m74	DANA	No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
L238958	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
L238956	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
L238955	u1120	m74	DANA	Janosz?
L238809	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
L238808	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
L238807	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
L238806	u1120	m74	DANA	Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
L238805	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
L238804	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
L238803	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
L238802	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
L238836	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you.
L238835	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I won't.
L238834	u1120	m74	DANA	Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
L238833	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Certainly.
L238832	u1120	m74	DANA	This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
L238827	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	No.  Not that I can recall.
L238826	u1120	m74	DANA	Does he ever mention me?
L238825	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
L238824	u1120	m74	DANA	How is he these days?
L238823	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Occasionally
L238822	u1120	m74	DANA	Do you ever see him?
L238821	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Oh no.
L238820	u1120	m74	DANA	Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
L238819	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
L238817	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
L238816	u1120	m74	DANA	What are you working on, Egon?
L238813	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
L238812	u1120	m74	DANA	Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
L238747	u1120	m74	DANA	That's exactly what you said last week.
L238746	u1122	m74	FRANK	Okay, that's no problem.
L238745	u1120	m74	DANA	No, you didn't, Frank.
L238744	u1122	m74	FRANK	Didn't I do it?
L238743	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
L238742	u1122	m74	FRANK	That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
L238741	u1122	m74	FRANK	Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
L238740	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
L238739	u1122	m74	FRANK	Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
L238738	u1120	m74	DANA	You're also a human being, Frank.
L238737	u1122	m74	FRANK	I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
L238736	u1120	m74	DANA	Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
L239537	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
L239536	u1120	m74	DANA	That's a terrible thing to say.
L239533	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Same difference.
L239532	u1120	m74	DANA	That's not true.  It was 1620.
L239500	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Finally came to your senses, huh?
L239499	u1120	m74	DANA	I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
L239272	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
L239271	u1120	m74	DANA	Maybe I should call Janine.
L239270	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Let me jingle you right now.
L239269	u1120	m74	DANA	So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
L239268	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
L239267	u1120	m74	DANA	Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
L239266	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm not even good for me.
L239265	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
L239264	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
L239263	u1120	m74	DANA	For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
L239262	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
L239261	u1120	m74	DANA	I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
L239260	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
L239224	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
L239223	u1120	m74	DANA	I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
L239222	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
L239221	u1120	m74	DANA	Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
L239220	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
L239219	u1120	m74	DANA	Does she know anything about babies?
L239218	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
L239217	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
L239216	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
L239215	u1120	m74	DANA	They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
L239213	u1120	m74	DANA	Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
L239212	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Are you all squeaky clean now?
L239153	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
L239152	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
L239151	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Or we could do that.
L239150	u1120	m74	DANA	How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
L239149	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
L239148	u1120	m74	DANA	Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
L239147	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
L239145	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
L239144	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
L239141	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
L239140	u1120	m74	DANA	It was full of this awful pink ooze.
L239139	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
L239138	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, what about the bathtub?
L239137	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
L239135	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
L239134	u1120	m74	DANA	I don't know what to do anymore.
L239133	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
L239132	u1120	m74	DANA	I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
L239131	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
L239130	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
L239129	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
L239128	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
L239097	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
L239096	u1120	m74	DANA	Good-bye, Peter.
L239095	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
L239090	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
L239089	u1120	m74	DANA	He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
L239081	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
L239080	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
L239078	u1120	m74	DANA	I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
L239077	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You're really good, you know.
L239076	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, hello, Peter.
L239075	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So this is what you do, huh?
L238974	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Thanks.
L238973	u1120	m74	DANA	Good luck.
L238972	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
L238971	u1120	m74	DANA	You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
L238970	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
L238969	u1120	m74	DANA	Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
L238968	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
L238967	u1120	m74	DANA	I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
L238903	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Okay, let's take a look.
L238902	u1120	m74	DANA	That's where the buggy stopped.
L238901	u1120	m74	DANA	We definitely had a moment or two.
L238900	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
L238894	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll supervise.
L238893	u1120	m74	DANA	I'll do it.
L238892	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
L238891	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
L238890	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oscar!  You poor kid!
L238889	u1120	m74	DANA	His name is Oscar.
L238888	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
L238887	u1120	m74	DANA	What do you think?
L238881	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
L238880	u1120	m74	DANA	"Well, when you started introducing me as ""the old ball and chain,"" that's when I left."
L238879	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
L238878	u1120	m74	DANA	You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
L238877	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
L238876	u1120	m74	DANA	"He didn't ""ditch"" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it."
L238875	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
L238874	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
L238873	u1120	m74	DANA	I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
L238872	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
L238871	u1120	m74	DANA	Hello, Peter.
L239299	u1120	m74	DANA	Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
L239298	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Sorry!
L238913	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
L238912	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
L238905	u1120	m74	DANA	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
L238904	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Is this the spot?
L238868	u1120	m74	DANA	Hi, Egon.
L238867	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
L238866	u1120	m74	DANA	Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
L238784	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
L238783	u1121	m74	ELAINE	It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
L238782	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
L238781	u1121	m74	ELAINE	I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
L238780	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
L238779	u1121	m74	ELAINE	According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
L239435	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
L239434	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
L239345	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Now you're talking.
L239344	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
L239343	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
L239342	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	That's quite a story.
L238799	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
L238798	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
L238797	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
L238796	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
L238795	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
L238794	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
L238793	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Can I help you?
L239454	u1124	m74	JANINE	You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
L239453	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
L239452	u1124	m74	JANINE	I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
L239327	u1127	m74	LOUIS	You're right.  We should stay.
L239326	u1124	m74	JANINE	I don't think we should leave her alone.
L239325	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Should we go?
L239280	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Tonight?
L239279	u1124	m74	JANINE	Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
L239278	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Okay.
L239277	u1124	m74	JANINE	You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
L239276	u1127	m74	LOUIS	So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
L239275	u1124	m74	JANINE	It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
L239274	u1127	m74	LOUIS	So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
L239273	u1124	m74	JANINE	I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
L239240	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, sure, that sounds great.
L239239	u1124	m74	JANINE	I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
L239238	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
L239237	u1124	m74	JANINE	Well, good night, Louis.
L239236	u1124	m74	JANINE	That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
L239235	u1127	m74	LOUIS	No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
L239234	u1124	m74	JANINE	Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
L239233	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
L239232	u1124	m74	JANINE	Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
L239231	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
L239230	u1124	m74	JANINE	What are you doing up here?
L239229	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
L239048	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Ghostbusters.
L239047	u1124	m74	JANINE	Who are you going to call?
L239046	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
L239045	u1124	m74	JANINE	It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
L239044	u1127	m74	LOUIS	What is it, honey?
L239486	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
L239485	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
L239194	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
L239193	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
L239184	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
L239183	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
L239182	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is the one that looked at Dana.
L239178	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	The Upper West Side.
L239177	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
L239175	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
L239174	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Then why have you come?
L239173	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I know.
L239172	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
L239094	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	My pleasure.
L239093	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
L239092	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
L239091	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
L239087	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Too bad for the Moldavians.
L239086	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
L239085	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
L239084	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
L239336	u1134	m74	VIGO	So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
L239335	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
L239334	u1134	m74	VIGO	The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
L239333	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I await the word of Vigo.
L239332	u1134	m74	VIGO	I command you.
L239331	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	-- the sorrow --
L239330	u1134	m74	VIGO	-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
L239329	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Yes, the scourge --
L239328	u1134	m74	VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
L238917	u1134	m74	VIGO	On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
L238916	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Command me, lord.
L238915	u1134	m74	VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
L239029	u1126	m74	JUDGE	You've got to stop them.  Please!
L239028	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	These boys aren't playing around.
L239027	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Maybe they just want to appeal.
L239026	u1126	m74	JUDGE	They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
L239025	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who are they?
L239024	u1126	m74	JUDGE	You've got to do something!
L239005	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
L239004	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
L239018	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Did I forget something?
L239017	u1126	m74	JUDGE	That's it?  That's all you have to say?
L239015	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
L239014	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Get on with it, counselor!
L239013	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Can I have some of your water?
L239012	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Yes.
L239011	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Your honor, may I approach the bench?
L238999	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Do I?
L238998	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
L238995	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
L238994	u1126	m74	JUDGE	The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
L239410	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
L239409	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
L239408	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
L239407	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
L239406	u1127	m74	LOUIS	This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
L239390	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
L239389	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
L239388	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
L239387	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
L239386	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	You were the one who got me in.
L239385	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
L239384	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Like what?
L239383	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
L239382	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
L239381	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
L239380	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
L239379	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
L238778	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
L238777	u1128	m74	MILTON	This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
L238776	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
L238775	u1128	m74	MILTON	I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
L238774	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
L238773	u1128	m74	MILTON	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
L238772	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
L239009	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
L239008	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
L239007	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
L239006	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
L239003	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
L239002	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
L238997	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
L238996	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
L239527	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
L239526	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
L239525	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	From where -- Neptune?
L239524	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
L239523	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Pretty impressive, huh?
L239476	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
L239475	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So far so good.
L239474	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
L239473	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
L239301	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
L239300	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
L239245	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
L239244	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
L239163	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
L239162	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	"That's it?  ""I'll be back?"""
L239157	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
L239156	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --
L238930	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You need the exercise.
L238929	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	You were supposed to help me with this.
L238911	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I knew that.
L238910	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	That's a thousand million electron volts.
L238899	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
L238898	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
L238897	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What now, Brainiac?
L238884	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
L238883	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'd like to have a stool specimen
L238855	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't even want to know where that is.
L238854	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
L238853	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
L238852	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Hello, Venkman.
L238851	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Egon!
L239491	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Do it!  Just do it!
L239490	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
L239431	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Something good --
L239430	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
L239429	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
L239428	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
L239427	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
L239286	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
L239285	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
L239255	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Nine feet -- ten --
L239254	u1132	m74	STANTZ	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
L239253	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Six feet -- seven -- eight --
L239161	u1132	m74	STANTZ	"This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, ""Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."""
L239160	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	"No, not exactly a man of the people.  ""Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."""
L239052	u1132	m74	STANTZ	And we're the ...
L239051	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm Egon --
L238989	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
L238988	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
L238964	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	"His nickname is ""The Hammer."""
L238963	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
L238941	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	What's the reading?
L238940	u1132	m74	STANTZ	This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
L238939	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
L238907	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
L238906	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Nothing.  Not a trace.
L238844	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Good idea.
L238843	u1132	m74	STANTZ	You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
L238842	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
L238841	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
L238840	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Who was that?
L239508	u1135	m74	WINSTON	There's something very familiar about this painting.
L239507	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
L239297	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	And it's all flowing toward the museum.
L239296	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Rivers of the stuff!
L239257	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	No, the slime is rising.
L239256	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Is the line sinking?
L239196	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
L239195	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
L239111	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
L239110	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
L239535	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
L239534	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What's your story, Pete?
L239529	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
L239528	u1132	m74	STANTZ	My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
L239520	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
L239519	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
L239488	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
L239487	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
L239480	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	She's new in town.
L239479	u1132	m74	STANTZ	My Fault!
L239478	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
L239477	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
L239466	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
L239465	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
L239450	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
L239449	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
L239426	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
L239425	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
L239416	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I hate Jello.
L239415	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It looks like a giant Jello mold.
L239295	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
L239294	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
L239293	u1132	m74	STANTZ	You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
L239249	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
L239248	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
L239243	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
L239242	u1132	m74	STANTZ	We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
L239241	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
L239206	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
L239205	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What happened?
L239186	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'll get one more reading.
L239185	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
L239155	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
L239154	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Did you find anything at Dana's?
L239116	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
L239115	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
L239114	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What kind of tests?
L239113	u1132	m74	STANTZ	We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
L239112	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Like a goat on garbage.
L239109	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
L239108	u1132	m74	STANTZ	This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
L239107	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is what you do with your spare time?
L239102	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
L239101	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	And now you're going to eat it?
L239099	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
L239098	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
L239065	u1132	m74	STANTZ	If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
L239064	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
L239057	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
L239056	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
L239055	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
L239050	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm Peter --
L239049	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'm Ray --
L239034	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Okay, let's heat 'em up!
L239033	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
L238920	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
L238919	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
L238918	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
L238909	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
L238908	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What's that?
L238896	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
L238895	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, Holmes, what do you think?
L238865	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Dana!  Dana Barrett!
L238864	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who, Ray?
L238863	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
L238862	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who?  Who?  Who?
L238861	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, Ray --
L238860	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Who?  Just -- someone we know.
L238859	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who?
L238858	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
L238857	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Great.  So what are you guys working on?
L238850	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
L238849	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
L238848	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
L238847	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So, no goat hooves, huh?
L238846	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh, hiya, Pete.
L238845	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
L239494	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
L239493	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
L239459	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
L239458	u1132	m74	STANTZ	She's moving!
L239289	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
L239288	u1135	m74	WINSTON	What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
L239284	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
L239283	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
L239282	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
L239281	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
L239208	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
L239207	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Are you all right?
L239202	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Well don't think!
L239201	u1135	m74	WINSTON	No, I just thought --
L239200	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Are you telling me how to drive?
L239192	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
L239191	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
L239190	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What?  Yeah.
L239189	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You finished here?
L239188	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Huh?  What?
L239187	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Now that's one ugly dude.
L239171	u1132	m74	STANTZ	"Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal ""Stabilize -- All Clear."""
L239170	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You got a flux and a half.
L239159	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
L239158	u1132	m74	STANTZ	And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
L239119	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
L239118	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Does it have any favorites?
L238771	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
L238770	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
L238769	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
L238768	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
L238767	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
L238766	u1135	m74	WINSTON	That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
L238755	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Then let's do it.
L238754	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I'm ready.
L238753	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Ready?
L239531	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
L239530	u1135	m74	WINSTON	My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
L239463	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
L239462	u1135	m74	WINSTON	How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
L239447	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
L239446	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Wonder what?
L239445	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
L239433	u1135	m74	WINSTON	And decent.
L239432	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	And pure --
L239374	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
L239373	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
L239340	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
L239339	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Tell him about the toaster.
L239123	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So we'll put a warning on the label.
L239122	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
L239121	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
L243076	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
L243075	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
L243074	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
L243028	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Do you want posters, too?
L243027	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
L242988	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Send them out!
L242987	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Not yet, dear brother...
L242986	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I am their hero!
L242985	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
L242984	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I want that bastard dead!
L242983	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
L242982	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
L242948	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?
L242947	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Yes?  Go on!
L242946	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast...
L242930	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	But I get what I want, always, don't I?
L242929	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
L242928	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
L242927	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	What are you talking about?
L242926	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
L242925	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
L242924	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	What is that... wailing?
L242923	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
L242922	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
L242921	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
L242920	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Where have you been?
L242844	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
L242843	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	You're coming back?
L242842	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Tribuus... tomorrow.
L242841	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
L242840	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
L242790	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Why not do it in the Colosseum?
L242789	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	For the gods, spit it out!
L242788	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	If I may be so bold...
L242787	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
L242768	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
L242767	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
L242766	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
L242765	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Those are priceless sculptures.
L242734	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
L242733	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
L242730	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	I'm sure, I don't know.
L242729	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
L242728	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
L242727	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I should at least have you, don't you think?
L242725	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
L242724	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
L242699	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
L242698	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Don't you think you should at least wave?
L242491	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
L242490	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
L242468	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
L242467	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
L242466	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
L242412	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
L242411	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
L242410	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	That's what you told me two days ago!
L242409	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	We're nearly there, Lucilla.
L242408	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
L243023	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
L243022	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
L242641	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	On what charge?
L242640	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
L242639	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
L242638	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
L242637	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Where is my family?
L242623	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
L242622	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	They won't break this one.
L242621	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
L242618	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	We have to stop the Germans now!
L242617	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
L242546	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	That this illness has clouded his mind.
L242545	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Caesar?
L242544	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
L242543	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	You flatter me, Caesar.
L242542	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
L242514	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
L242513	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	But they're not destroyed, not yet.
L242508	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
L242507	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
L242500	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
L242499	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
L242488	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
L242487	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Gladly Caesar.
L242486	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Then you'd be out of a job.
L242471	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
L242470	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	That's difficult to say, general.
L242469	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
L242443	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
L242442	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
L242441	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
L242825	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I wouldn't know who to bet on.
L242824	u1157	m76	FALCO	Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
L242784	u1157	m76	FALCO	Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
L242783	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Take grain away from the army?
L242782	u1157	m76	FALCO	Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
L242781	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Give away food?
L242780	u1157	m76	FALCO	We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
L242779	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	So am I.
L242778	u1157	m76	FALCO	I'm serious.
L242777	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
L242776	u1157	m76	FALCO	Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
L242775	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
L242753	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
L242752	u1157	m76	FALCO	"And like children everywhere they scream ""freedom"" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar."
L242707	u1157	m76	FALCO	Until your confirmation date.
L242706	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
L242703	u1157	m76	FALCO	At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
L242702	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
L242701	u1157	m76	FALCO	Caesar, ignore them.
L242656	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
L242655	u1157	m76	FALCO	The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
L242643	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
L242642	u1157	m76	FALCO	Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
L243079	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
L243078	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
L243077	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	It's because he comes off as the underdog.
L243073	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
L243072	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
L242620	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
L242619	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
L242611	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	He left us at dawn.
L242610	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	Marcus Aurelius has died.
L242445	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
L242444	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
L242999	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...
L242998	u1168	m76	TRIBUUS	Yes, Caesar.
L242997	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
L242846	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Jerses -- tomorrow...
L242845	u1168	m76	TRIBUUS	Yes, Caesar?
L242828	u1168	m76	TRIBUUS	Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
L242827	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
L242732	u1168	m76	TRIBUUS	He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
L242731	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
L242415	u1168	m76	TRIBUUS	Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
L242414	u1155	m76	COMMODUS	Where is my father?
L243036	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
L243035	u1156	m76	COS	I'll nose around...
L243034	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
L243033	u1156	m76	COS	I don't know...
L243032	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
L242953	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
L242952	u1156	m76	COS	Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens.  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
L242742	u1156	m76	COS	I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
L242741	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
L242740	u1156	m76	COS	You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
L243031	u1156	m76	COS	Yes, because I know they'll read it.
L243030	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
L242943	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
L242942	u1156	m76	COS	That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
L242941	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
L242940	u1156	m76	COS	The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
L242939	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
L242938	u1156	m76	COS	I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
L242937	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
L242936	u1156	m76	COS	So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
L242485	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
L242484	u1157	m76	FALCO	But have never been?
L242483	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I've read of it.
L242482	u1157	m76	FALCO	You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
L242481	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
L242480	u1157	m76	FALCO	God of passages and changes?
L242479	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
L242646	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I hope you live to see what I believe...
L242645	u1158	m76	GAIUS	The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
L242644	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	The Senate too?
L242506	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	We all know what right is, Senator.
L242505	u1158	m76	GAIUS	The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
L242504	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
L242475	u1158	m76	GAIUS	Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
L242474	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
L242865	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	You don't know how wrong you are.
L242864	u1159	m76	GRACCHUS	You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
L242863	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
L242862	u1159	m76	GRACCHUS	Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
L242861	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
L242860	u1159	m76	GRACCHUS	How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
L242859	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	You're hearing about somebody else.
L242858	u1159	m76	GRACCHUS	Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
L242660	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	They can't... if this is Rome...
L242659	u1160	m76	JUBA	Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
L242652	u1160	m76	JUBA	That's what worries me...
L242651	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
L242650	u1160	m76	JUBA	My loyalties... were in doubt.
L242649	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Why you?
L242648	u1160	m76	JUBA	You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
L242919	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
L242918	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Where are they?
L242917	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
L242916	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	He killed his father and then my family...
L242915	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
L242914	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Would that Marcus had lived.
L242913	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	You cannot die.
L242908	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	But what if I wish to be purple?
L242907	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But...
L242906	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
L242905	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
L242902	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
L242901	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
L242899	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
L242898	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
L242897	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
L242891	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Yours will do!
L242890	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
L242555	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
L242554	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
L242553	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
L242552	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Why do you play at being drunk?
L242551	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
L242550	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
L242549	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
L242548	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Sneaking around with your brother?
L242547	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
L242459	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Only from a distance.
L242458	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
L242455	u1161	m76	LUCILLA	Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
L242454	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
L242537	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
L242536	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
L242535	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	They fear me.
L242534	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	The Senators admire you.
L242533	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
L242532	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
L242531	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
L242530	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
L242529	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	So I understand.
L242528	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
L242527	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
L242526	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
L242525	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
L242524	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	Servis made it through again?
L242523	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
L242522	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
L242521	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
L242520	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
L242517	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
L242516	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
L242515	u1162	m76	MARCUS AURELIUS	Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
L242606	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	On my honor as your daddy...
L242605	u1167	m76	THEMIS	On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
L242604	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	As soon as I can.
L242603	u1167	m76	THEMIS	Tomorrow?
L242602	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
L242566	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
L242565	u1167	m76	THEMIS	I made the plume from a quail feather.
L243068	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
L243067	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
L243055	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
L243054	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
L243053	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
L243052	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
L243051	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
L243050	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
L243049	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	I was summoned.
L243048	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	You brought the army into Rome.
L242633	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	I can't let you do that.
L242632	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
L242629	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Well, they die for it!
L242628	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	My troops don't make policy.
L242627	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
L242626	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
L242625	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	What deal?
L242624	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
L242616	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
L242615	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	Serious stuff...
L242449	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	Well, we can try...
L242448	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
L242447	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
L242446	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	What the hell was all that about?
L242428	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
L242427	u1165	m76	QUINTUS	I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
L243130	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
L243129	u1166	m76	SELENE	You teach them!
L243128	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
L243127	u1166	m76	SELENE	Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
L243126	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
L243125	u1166	m76	SELENE	I don't want you to die!
L243124	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
L243123	u1166	m76	SELENE	Narcissus!
L243122	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
L243121	u1166	m76	SELENE	You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
L243120	u1166	m76	SELENE	No!
L243119	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
L242598	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
L242597	u1166	m76	SELENE	I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
L242596	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
L242595	u1166	m76	SELENE	I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
L242594	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Quintus is overly idealistic.
L242593	u1166	m76	SELENE	Let him trust Quintus.
L242592	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
L242591	u1166	m76	SELENE	We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
L242590	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
L242589	u1166	m76	SELENE	Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
L242588	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
L242586	u1166	m76	SELENE	I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
L242585	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	This is our oil from our estates?
L242583	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
L242582	u1166	m76	SELENE	The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
L242581	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I can see that...
L242580	u1166	m76	SELENE	You need to come home!
L242578	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Of course...
L242577	u1166	m76	SELENE	They're studying with Cynics.
L242576	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	What about their philosophy lessons?
L242570	u1166	m76	SELENE	Athenians...
L242569	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Greeks?
L242568	u1166	m76	SELENE	Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
L242564	u1166	m76	SELENE	Isn't the helmet magnificent?
L242563	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	He's very realistic.
L243117	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
L243116	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
L243098	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
L243097	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I want nothing to do with the arena.
L243096	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
L243043	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Was I?
L243042	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
L243041	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
L243013	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
L243012	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
L243011	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Right, right, what am I thinking of?
L243010	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Before they leave, get gold.
L243009	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
L243008	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Then get a large cash advance.
L243007	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
L243006	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
L243005	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
L243004	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
L243003	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
L243002	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	How much money is involved?
L242977	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
L242976	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
L242975	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
L242974	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
L242972	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
L242971	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
L242970	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
L242969	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
L242968	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
L242967	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
L242966	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	You get to come alive again in the country!
L242965	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
L242964	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
L242963	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
L242962	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
L242950	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
L242949	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
L242935	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Lucky it didn't step on his head.
L242934	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
L242895	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Don't be ridiculous.
L242894	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
L242885	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Alive... I'm alive...
L242884	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
L242851	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Think about it!  Just think about it!
L242850	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	"What would the poster say: ""Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"""
L242849	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
L242739	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	That's one way to look at it.
L242738	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
L242737	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	General, do you realize what happened out there today?
L242714	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
L242713	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
L242712	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
L242693	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	-- to fight?  We'll see...
L242692	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
L242691	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
L242690	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Chain him.
L242689	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Take your hands off me animal!
L242682	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
L242681	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Death is a very light thing for you.
L242680	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
L242679	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
L242676	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
L242675	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
L242674	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
L242673	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
L242672	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	Who the hell are you?
L242671	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
L242670	u1163	m76	NARCISSUS	I killed too many barbarians.
L242669	u1164	m76	PROXIMO	You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
L274152	u1297	m86	MANNING	Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
L274151	u1289	m86	ABE	They were over here, Professor.
L274150	u1289	m86	ABE	Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
L274149	u1297	m86	MANNING	Is he serious??
L274148	u1289	m86	ABE	The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
L274147	u1297	m86	MANNING	See what??
L274146	u1289	m86	ABE	"I need to touch it to ""see""..."
L274265	u1289	m86	ABE	Oh, right --
L274264	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
L274263	u1289	m86	ABE	Remind me why I keep doing this.
L274207	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Didn't even buy me a drink.
L274206	u1289	m86	ABE	Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
L274200	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
L274199	u1289	m86	ABE	Red. How long was it latched onto you?
L274190	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I'm lucky that way.
L274189	u1289	m86	ABE	You were burned by some organic acid.
L274088	u1289	m86	ABE	No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
L274087	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Nah -- he's taken care of.
L274082	u1289	m86	ABE	Red, I found something --
L274081	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
L274078	u1289	m86	ABE	Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
L274077	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
L274064	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	We don't take hints.
L274063	u1289	m86	ABE	Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
L274062	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
L274061	u1289	m86	ABE	Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
L274060	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't get psychic with me.
L274059	u1289	m86	ABE	You mean, outside... with her.
L274058	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
L274057	u1289	m86	ABE	Story of my life.
L274056	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
L274094	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	It doesn't say --
L274093	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
L274092	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
L274091	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	-- Hound of resurrection?
L274090	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	See? I don't like that --
L274089	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	hound of resurrection --
L274086	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
L274085	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	That's all for you, Sammy.
L273934	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	From where??!!
L273933	u1291	m86	BROOM	Cordon off the area. Something came through.
L273912	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Air and sea backup. What's closest?
L273911	u1291	m86	BROOM	If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
L273910	u1291	m86	BROOM	Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
L273909	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	The freak in the gas mask --
L273906	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Oh, I'll bet you have.
L273905	u1291	m86	BROOM	I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
L273904	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
L273903	u1291	m86	BROOM	Paranormal  But -- you read the transmission.
L273902	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
L273901	u1291	m86	BROOM	Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
L273900	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
L273899	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	"Three days too late for that one, ""professor."""
L273898	u1291	m86	BROOM	I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
L273897	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Here. You'll need one of these.
L273896	u1291	m86	BROOM	Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
L273895	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	You are a Catholic??
L273893	u1291	m86	BROOM	In private, if you don't mind...
L273892	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	What is it?
L273891	u1291	m86	BROOM	Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
L273890	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
L273889	u1291	m86	BROOM	This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
L273948	u1291	m86	BROOM	I think that is its hand.
L273947	u1298	m86	MATLIN	It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
L273943	u1291	m86	BROOM	No. It was red. Bright red.
L273942	u1298	m86	MATLIN	What the hell was that? An ape?
L273941	u1298	m86	MATLIN	That makes him more than a hundred --
L273940	u1291	m86	BROOM	Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
L273939	u1298	m86	MATLIN	C'mon -- Rasputin??
L273938	u1291	m86	BROOM	Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
L273937	u1298	m86	MATLIN	Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
L273936	u1291	m86	BROOM	There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
L273935	u1298	m86	MATLIN	Do you believe in hell?
L273932	u1291	m86	BROOM	No. It's not.
L273931	u1298	m86	MATLIN	It's almost over!!
L274144	u1291	m86	BROOM	I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
L274143	u1297	m86	MANNING	These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
L274141	u1291	m86	BROOM	He's just going through a phase --
L274140	u1297	m86	MANNING	"Your ""guest"" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded."
L274139	u1291	m86	BROOM	Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
L274138	u1297	m86	MANNING	I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
L274137	u1291	m86	BROOM	I thought you liked being on TV.
L274136	u1297	m86	MANNING	Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
L274235	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Oh, as opposed to -- ?
L274234	u1291	m86	BROOM	It's her choice --  She's human --
L274233	u1291	m86	BROOM	That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
L274232	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
L274205	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Is it bad?
L274204	u1291	m86	BROOM	Don't look! Turn around.
L274198	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
L274197	u1291	m86	BROOM	Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
L274196	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Me?? C'mon --
L274195	u1291	m86	BROOM	I worry about you.
L274194	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
L274193	u1291	m86	BROOM	Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
L274192	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
L274191	u1291	m86	BROOM	Son. About Rasputin --
L274076	u1291	m86	BROOM	A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
L274075	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Reliquary --
L274074	u1291	m86	BROOM	Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
L274073	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Who wards off demons.
L274072	u1291	m86	BROOM	A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
L274217	u1299	m86	MYERS	"Oh, please. I'm not ""pure of heart."""
L274216	u1291	m86	BROOM	And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
L274213	u1291	m86	BROOM	You're doing fine.
L274212	u1299	m86	MYERS	I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
L274018	u1291	m86	BROOM	Did he, now?
L274017	u1299	m86	MYERS	1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
L274016	u1291	m86	BROOM	1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
L274011	u1291	m86	BROOM	In the absence of light, darkness prevails. For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
L274010	u1299	m86	MYERS	In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt...
L274009	u1291	m86	BROOM	Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
L274008	u1299	m86	MYERS	On the desk, yes. In Latin.
L274007	u1291	m86	BROOM	As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
L274006	u1299	m86	MYERS	Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
L274005	u1291	m86	BROOM	"Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  ""Unique."" That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here."
L274004	u1299	m86	MYERS	How does he know so much about me?
L274002	u1291	m86	BROOM	"The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence ""Abe"" Sapien."
L274001	u1299	m86	MYERS	Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
L274000	u1291	m86	BROOM	They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
L274188	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
L274187	u1292	m86	CLAY	C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
L274069	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
L274068	u1292	m86	CLAY	At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
L274054	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
L274053	u1292	m86	CLAY	We're on the move.
L274052	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
L274046	u1292	m86	CLAY	Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
L274045	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Myers, huh? You have a first name??
L274044	u1292	m86	CLAY	It is. You got yourself on TV again.
L274043	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
L274042	u1292	m86	CLAY	Well, you did break out --
L274039	u1292	m86	CLAY	Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
L274038	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I don't want him.
L274037	u1292	m86	CLAY	Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
L274036	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Got tired of me?
L274035	u1292	m86	CLAY	Agent Myers is your new liaison.
L274034	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Who's the squirt?
L274176	u1292	m86	CLAY	Not so fast. He barely knows him --
L274175	u1299	m86	MYERS	Sir, may I go first??
L274049	u1299	m86	MYERS	His what??!!
L274048	u1292	m86	CLAY	"His horns. He files 'em. To ""fit in."""
L274047	u1299	m86	MYERS	Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
L274031	u1292	m86	CLAY	Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
L274030	u1299	m86	MYERS	Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
L274027	u1299	m86	MYERS	Who?!
L274026	u1292	m86	CLAY	He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
L274024	u1292	m86	CLAY	Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
L274023	u1299	m86	MYERS	Grounded? Who's grounded?
L274022	u1292	m86	CLAY	They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
L274508	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I can live with that.
L274507	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
L274502	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Anung-un-Rama...
L274501	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	"Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: ""The crossroads.""  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key."
L274498	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Noooo! Noooo!!!
L274497	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	She's dead.
L274099	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
L274098	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
L274097	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	That voice --
L274469	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	My job.
L274468	u1297	m86	MANNING	Thank you.
L274466	u1297	m86	MANNING	You never, ever light a cigar that way.
L274465	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Yup.
L274464	u1297	m86	MANNING	You call that thing a cigar??
L274463	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
L274452	u1297	m86	MANNING	I'm in charge. We go back!
L274451	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No. Don't --
L274450	u1297	m86	MANNING	-- should go back. Now!
L274449	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't move. We --
L274448	u1297	m86	MANNING	We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
L274426	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I won't take 'em. They never work.
L274425	u1297	m86	MANNING	Each of us gets a belt.
L274424	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Those things never work. Never.
L274423	u1297	m86	MANNING	We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
L274422	u1297	m86	MANNING	When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
L274421	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	One falls, two shall arise. So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
L274306	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I wish I could be more gracious but --
L274305	u1297	m86	MANNING	In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
L274304	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What are you trying to say?
L274303	u1297	m86	MANNING	That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
L274302	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
L274301	u1297	m86	MANNING	Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
L274300	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I knew those men better than you did --
L274299	u1297	m86	MANNING	But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
L274516	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How big can it be?
L274515	u1299	m86	MYERS	Alone?
L274514	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
L274446	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
L274445	u1299	m86	MYERS	Are you sure about this?
L274339	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Good night.
L274338	u1299	m86	MYERS	Well good n-
L274337	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Not from you.
L274336	u1299	m86	MYERS	Anything else you --
L274332	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Not hungry.
L274331	u1299	m86	MYERS	Hey, your chili's getting cold --
L274322	u1299	m86	MYERS	Start in, you got nachos coming.
L274321	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"Nah, sounds too ""needy."""
L274320	u1299	m86	MYERS	Need is a good, solid word.
L274319	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for ""need"" --"
L274318	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Shh! Just a second.
L274317	u1299	m86	MYERS	Where do you --
L274242	u1299	m86	MYERS	Hostage negotiations.
L274241	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What was that??
L274240	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"What landed you this job, pushing ""pamcakes""? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?"
L274239	u1299	m86	MYERS	I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
L274238	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hey. You: think twice --
L274237	u1299	m86	MYERS	Professor, that girl you were talking about --
L274236	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"Mmmh -- ""Pamcakes."" We're going out --"
L274210	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
L274209	u1299	m86	MYERS	Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
L274202	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	That's right, Stud, hold me down.
L274201	u1299	m86	MYERS	You want me to hold him down?
L274186	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Could've fooled me. Go away.
L274185	u1299	m86	MYERS	No. I never was.
L274184	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What are you, a Boy Scout?
L274183	u1299	m86	MYERS	C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
L274182	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What took you so long?
L274132	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Goodbye.
L274131	u1299	m86	MYERS	Yes?
L274130	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Myers?
L274129	u1299	m86	MYERS	No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
L274128	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
L274127	u1299	m86	MYERS	Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
L274126	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
L274124	u1299	m86	MYERS	My arm is fine. Where are you??
L274123	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Myers??? How's your arm?
L274103	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No one ever helps me. It's my job.
L274102	u1299	m86	MYERS	Helping you -- I just --
L274051	u1299	m86	MYERS	Oh-n-no -- I --
L274050	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Whatcha looking at, John??
L274041	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Father's back?  Still angry?
L274040	u1299	m86	MYERS	Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
L274029	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
L274028	u1299	m86	MYERS	You're kidding --
L274444	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	...Polo.
L274443	u1295	m86	LIZ	Marco...
L274442	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
L274410	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Good.
L274409	u1295	m86	LIZ	I like that...
L274408	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
L274407	u1295	m86	LIZ	Red, I --
L274406	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
L274404	u1295	m86	LIZ	I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
L274403	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hi.
L274335	u1295	m86	LIZ	Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
L274334	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
L274329	u1295	m86	LIZ	No. Myers is taking me.
L274328	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	You're going alone?
L274327	u1295	m86	LIZ	For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
L274326	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Out? Out out?
L274325	u1295	m86	LIZ	Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
L274324	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
L274180	u1295	m86	LIZ	Goodnight.
L274179	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Goodnight, then.
L274171	u1295	m86	LIZ	No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
L274170	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
L274169	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
L274168	u1295	m86	LIZ	You better have that looked at.
L274481	u1299	m86	MYERS	What?
L274480	u1295	m86	LIZ	Hit me.
L274474	u1295	m86	LIZ	You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
L274473	u1299	m86	MYERS	That you feel that way about me.
L274472	u1295	m86	LIZ	What -- ?
L274471	u1299	m86	MYERS	But it's not true, is it?
L274359	u1295	m86	LIZ	Coffee's warming me up.
L274358	u1299	m86	MYERS	It's freezing, isn't it?
L274355	u1295	m86	LIZ	Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
L274354	u1299	m86	MYERS	What about you?
L274353	u1295	m86	LIZ	I know.
L274352	u1299	m86	MYERS	He -- loves you.
L274351	u1299	m86	MYERS	My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
L274350	u1295	m86	LIZ	A brute.
L274349	u1299	m86	MYERS	Strong.
L274348	u1295	m86	LIZ	Cocky.
L274347	u1299	m86	MYERS	No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
L274346	u1295	m86	LIZ	He's just pushy.
L274345	u1299	m86	MYERS	I admire him. He's a force of nature.
L274251	u1299	m86	MYERS	Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
L274250	u1295	m86	LIZ	Doesn't sounds like him.
L274249	u1299	m86	MYERS	Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
L274248	u1299	m86	MYERS	It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
L274247	u1295	m86	LIZ	"60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED ""LIZ""."
L274246	u1299	m86	MYERS	Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
L273988	u1296	m86	LOBBY GUARD	Two steps back, please.
L273987	u1299	m86	MYERS	Pardon?
L273986	u1296	m86	LOBBY GUARD	-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
L273985	u1299	m86	MYERS	Yes, I --
L273984	u1296	m86	LOBBY GUARD	-- Late. Five minutes late.
L273983	u1299	m86	MYERS	Hello, I'm --
L299148	u1446	m97	PHILIP	If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
L299147	u1433	m97	ALICIA	This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
L298768	u1446	m97	PHILIP	Cool.
L298767	u1433	m97	ALICIA	We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
L298766	u1446	m97	PHILIP	I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
L298765	u1433	m97	ALICIA	It's really nice of you to help us.
L298764	u1446	m97	PHILIP	Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
L299185	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	You bet it did.
L299184	u1435	m97	DAVID	Did it work?
L299183	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Are you all right?
L299063	u1435	m97	DAVID	If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
L299062	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
L299059	u1435	m97	DAVID	We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
L299058	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
L298937	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
L298936	u1435	m97	DAVID	Better be. You left me for him.
L298935	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	He's a good man.
L298934	u1435	m97	DAVID	You still believe in him.
L298932	u1435	m97	DAVID	A toast to the end of the world.
L298931	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I take it you've heard.
L298930	u1435	m97	DAVID	Just my luck, no ice.
L298781	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	David, don't...
L298780	u1435	m97	DAVID	You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
L298647	u1435	m97	DAVID	He's not going to listen to me.
L298646	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
L298645	u1435	m97	DAVID	I want you to leave with us. Right now.
L298644	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	What do you want me to do?
L298643	u1435	m97	DAVID	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
L298642	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
L298625	u1435	m97	DAVID	Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
L298624	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	David? How'd you get this number?
L298623	u1435	m97	DAVID	Connie, don't hang up.
L298622	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	What?
L298522	u1435	m97	DAVID	It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
L298521	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	You're being paranoid.
L298520	u1435	m97	DAVID	I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
L298519	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
L298518	u1435	m97	DAVID	You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
L298517	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
L298516	u1435	m97	DAVID	You have to leave the White House.
L298515	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	What do you want?
L298723	u1442	m97	MOISHE	All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
L298722	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Love was never our problem.
L298721	u1442	m97	MOISHE	All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
L298720	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	Spunky. He told you about that?
L298719	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Think nothing of it, Spanky.
L298718	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
L298665	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
L298664	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
L298653	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Punched the President? Oh my god.
L298652	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
L298739	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Then get them out of there.
L298738	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	We're losing them.
L298703	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
L298702	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	You saved a lot of lives.
L298662	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I'll bet.
L298661	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
L298660	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	I don't know how you put up with him.
L298439	u1434	m97	CONSTANCE	More than likely.
L298438	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
L298511	u1435	m97	DAVID	Checkmate.
L298510	u1440	m97	MARTY	Then what?
L298507	u1435	m97	DAVID	Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
L298506	u1440	m97	MARTY	A countdown to what?
L298505	u1435	m97	DAVID	That signal. It's a countdown.
L298504	u1440	m97	MARTY	Not really...
L298503	u1435	m97	DAVID	Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
L298502	u1440	m97	MARTY	Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
L298500	u1435	m97	DAVID	Just do it!
L298499	u1440	m97	MARTY	What happened?
L298498	u1435	m97	DAVID	Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
L298456	u1440	m97	MARTY	Haven't you been watching?
L298455	u1435	m97	DAVID	What're you talking about?
L298454	u1440	m97	MARTY	Can you believe this?
L298453	u1435	m97	DAVID	Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
L298452	u1440	m97	MARTY	Huh? Oh, good, good.
L298451	u1435	m97	DAVID	I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
L298404	u1440	m97	MARTY	...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
L298403	u1435	m97	DAVID	Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
L298402	u1440	m97	MARTY	That's the good news?
L298401	u1435	m97	DAVID	No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
L298400	u1440	m97	MARTY	And the good news is you won't charge me.
L298399	u1435	m97	DAVID	You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
L298398	u1440	m97	MARTY	What's the bad news?
L298397	u1435	m97	DAVID	There's good news and bad news.
L298354	u1440	m97	MARTY	We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
L298353	u1435	m97	DAVID	Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
L298352	u1440	m97	MARTY	Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
L298351	u1435	m97	DAVID	Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
L298350	u1440	m97	MARTY	So sue me.
L298349	u1435	m97	DAVID	What the hell is this?
L298347	u1440	m97	MARTY	Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
L298346	u1435	m97	DAVID	It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
L298345	u1440	m97	MARTY	What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
L299088	u1442	m97	MOISHE	I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
L299087	u1435	m97	DAVID	Thanks, Pops.
L298982	u1435	m97	DAVID	A cold? Of course.
L298981	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What'd I say?
L298980	u1435	m97	DAVID	Pops, you're a genius!
L298978	u1442	m97	MOISHE	David, you're drunk.
L298977	u1435	m97	DAVID	We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
L298976	u1442	m97	MOISHE	This I can see.
L298975	u1435	m97	DAVID	I'm making a mess.
L298974	u1442	m97	MOISHE	David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
L298791	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
L298790	u1435	m97	DAVID	Dad, please...
L298715	u1435	m97	DAVID	Moishe, please, don't talk.
L298714	u1442	m97	MOISHE	It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
L298651	u1435	m97	DAVID	He wasn't the President then.
L298650	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You punched the President in the face?
L298649	u1435	m97	DAVID	Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
L298648	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
L298619	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You can do that?
L298618	u1435	m97	DAVID	Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
L298617	u1442	m97	MOISHE	It's perfect the line is busy?
L298616	u1435	m97	DAVID	Perfect, she's using it.
L298603	u1435	m97	DAVID	She didn't take my name when we were married.
L298602	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You try Martin?
L298601	u1435	m97	DAVID	College nickname.
L298600	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Spunky?
L298599	u1435	m97	DAVID	I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
L298598	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Not listed, huh?
L298582	u1435	m97	DAVID	She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
L298581	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
L298580	u1435	m97	DAVID	This, pops, is every phone book in America.
L298579	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What the hell is that?
L298555	u1442	m97	MOISHE	All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
L298554	u1435	m97	DAVID	Dad...
L298553	u1442	m97	MOISHE	And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
L298552	u1435	m97	DAVID	They don't know this.
L298551	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
L298550	u1435	m97	DAVID	Can't this thing go any faster?
L298549	u1442	m97	MOISHE	It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
L298529	u1435	m97	DAVID	That's okay. You're driving.
L298528	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
L298527	u1435	m97	DAVID	You still got the Olds?
L298526	u1442	m97	MOISHE	The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
L298525	u1435	m97	DAVID	Pops!
L298340	u1442	m97	MOISHE	Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
L298339	u1435	m97	DAVID	Three years.
L298338	u1442	m97	MOISHE	I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
L298337	u1435	m97	DAVID	Dad, don't start.
L298336	u1442	m97	MOISHE	David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
L298335	u1442	m97	MOISHE	You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
L298334	u1435	m97	DAVID	You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
L298332	u1442	m97	MOISHE	So think already.
L298331	u1435	m97	DAVID	I'm thinking.
L298330	u1442	m97	MOISHE	What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
L299177	u1450	m97	STEVE	I don't hear no fat lady.
L299176	u1435	m97	DAVID	Doesn't matter. Game's over.
L299175	u1450	m97	STEVE	We're loose!
L299171	u1435	m97	DAVID	You as well.
L299170	u1450	m97	STEVE	Nice meeting you.
L299142	u1435	m97	DAVID	It's not me. They're overriding the system.
L299141	u1450	m97	STEVE	What're you doing?
L299140	u1450	m97	STEVE	I can't shake her free.
L299139	u1435	m97	DAVID	Get us out of here!
L299118	u1450	m97	STEVE	Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
L299117	u1435	m97	DAVID	Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
L299100	u1450	m97	STEVE	Just getting a feel for her.
L299099	u1435	m97	DAVID	What the hell are you doing?
L299095	u1450	m97	STEVE	Great.
L299094	u1435	m97	DAVID	I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
L299057	u1435	m97	DAVID	We'll meet you there.
L299056	u1450	m97	STEVE	Oh shit, we're late.
L299055	u1435	m97	DAVID	I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
L299113	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Roger.
L299112	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
L299104	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
L299103	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Where's it headed?
L299102	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
L299101	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Grey, you read me?
L299084	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
L299083	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
L299041	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Then find them.
L299040	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
L299039	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	But what, General?
L299038	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We've been collecting planes from all over but...
L299037	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And our troops here?
L299036	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
L299035	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Better than we thought.
L299034	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	How're we doing?
L299020	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Yes, Sir.
L299019	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
L298868	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	We're being exterminated.
L298867	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
L298866	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And our forces?
L298864	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
L298863	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
L298709	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	ETA with target; four minutes.
L298708	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Where are they?
L298705	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
L298704	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Any news on my wife?
L298686	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	She should be shortly.
L298685	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Is my wife in the air?
L298675	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
L298674	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	But Mr. President...
L298673	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
L298449	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Then God help us.
L298448	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
L298447	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I had a feeling you would.
L298446	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
L299009	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
L299008	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	With their shields down it might be possible.
L299005	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	How long would their shields be down?
L299004	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	This is ridiculous.
L298862	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
L298861	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	It had been deemed classified.
L298860	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
L298779	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
L298778	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
L298777	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	That's impossible...
L298563	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
L298562	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
L298561	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
L298437	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
L298436	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
L298383	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
L298382	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
L298303	u1449	m97	SECOND OFFICER	It's... slowing down, Sir.
L298302	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	It's doing what?
L298301	u1449	m97	SECOND OFFICER	Well, er... it's slowing down.
L298300	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	How do you know?
L298299	u1449	m97	SECOND OFFICER	No Sir. Definitely not.
L298298	u1436	m97	GENERAL GREY	A meteor?
L299182	u1450	m97	STEVE	Butt-munch.
L299181	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Dick-weed.
L299180	u1450	m97	STEVE	Yeah, but what an entrance!
L299179	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You scared the hell out of me.
L299075	u1450	m97	STEVE	I should have done this a long long time ago.
L299074	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Sorry for what?
L299073	u1450	m97	STEVE	Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
L299072	u1437	m97	JASMINE	I know, you like to make a big entrance.
L299071	u1450	m97	STEVE	You know me...
L299070	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You're late.
L298959	u1450	m97	STEVE	You know how I like to make a big entrance.
L298958	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You're late.
L298546	u1450	m97	STEVE	Butt-munch.
L298545	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Dick-weed!
L298544	u1450	m97	STEVE	Yes, I am.
L298543	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
L298542	u1450	m97	STEVE	Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
L298541	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Really? You don't mind?
L298540	u1450	m97	STEVE	Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
L298539	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Be careful.
L298538	u1450	m97	STEVE	What?
L298537	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Wait. I have to tell you something.
L298533	u1450	m97	STEVE	They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
L298532	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
L298531	u1450	m97	STEVE	Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
L298530	u1437	m97	JASMINE	You can't go. Call them back.
L298487	u1450	m97	STEVE	He's doing a good job.
L298486	u1437	m97	JASMINE	He's trying to impress you.
L298894	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
L298893	u1439	m97	MARGARET	I thought you didn't recognize me.
L298892	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
L298891	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
L298890	u1439	m97	MARGARET	And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
L298889	u1437	m97	JASMINE	Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
L298888	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Oh. Sorry.
L298887	u1437	m97	JASMINE	No. Exotic.
L298886	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Really? Ballet?
L298885	u1437	m97	JASMINE	I'm a dancer.
L298884	u1439	m97	MARGARET	So, what do you do for a living?
L298883	u1437	m97	JASMINE	He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
L298882	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Was his father stationed here?
L298881	u1437	m97	JASMINE	He's my angel.
L298880	u1439	m97	MARGARET	Your son.
L298746	u1450	m97	STEVE	Jimmy, stay with me.
L298745	u1438	m97	JIMMY	Stevie... I can't...
L298744	u1450	m97	STEVE	So push it!
L298743	u1438	m97	JIMMY	We're already over Mach 2!
L298742	u1450	m97	STEVE	Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
L298732	u1450	m97	STEVE	"Command, Eagle One. Switching to ""sidewinders."" We're moving in."
L298731	u1438	m97	JIMMY	I didn't even see them fire!
L298730	u1450	m97	STEVE	Damn it!
L298725	u1438	m97	JIMMY	Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
L298724	u1450	m97	STEVE	I shouldn't have left her.
L298713	u1438	m97	JIMMY	I hear you.
L298712	u1450	m97	STEVE	Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
L298711	u1438	m97	JIMMY	That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
L298613	u1450	m97	STEVE	I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
L298612	u1438	m97	JIMMY	Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
L298611	u1450	m97	STEVE	How to kiss ass.
L298610	u1438	m97	JIMMY	I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
L298696	u1451	m97	TROY	I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
L298695	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	But I gave you some this morning.
L298571	u1451	m97	TROY	That'd be cool!
L298570	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
L298569	u1451	m97	TROY	He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
L298360	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
L298359	u1451	m97	TROY	I don't need it.
L298358	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
L298357	u1451	m97	TROY	It's all fuzzy.
L298356	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Stop it.
L299043	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
L299042	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	How' he doing?
L298763	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
L298762	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	We should leave too.
L298761	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
L298634	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
L298633	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
L298631	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
L298630	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
L298629	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
L298628	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	They let you out?
L298410	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
L298409	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	You sure?
L298408	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
L298407	u1448	m97	RUSSELL	I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
L298406	u1441	m97	MIGUEL	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
L298957	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I said call them back.
L298956	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
L298955	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Call them back.
L298948	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Deploy.
L298947	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Mr. President?
L298815	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
L298814	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
L298774	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
L298773	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Above American soil?
L298772	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
L298677	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	We're leaving.
L298676	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	What the hell's going on?
L298445	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
L298444	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	But, Mr. President...
L298443	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
L298442	u1443	m97	NIMZIKI	We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
L298441	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	I'm not leaving.
L298835	u1444	m97	OKUN	These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
L298834	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Can they be killed?
L298829	u1444	m97	OKUN	Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
L298828	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
L298827	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	"People are dying out there. I don't think ""exciting"" is the word I'd choose to describe it!"
L298826	u1444	m97	OKUN	See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
L298821	u1444	m97	OKUN	Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
L298820	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Yes.
L298819	u1444	m97	OKUN	Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
L298921	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Die.
L298920	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	What do you want us to do?
L298919	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Peace? No peace.
L298918	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
L298917	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Many worlds...
L298916	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	And before here?
L298915	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	Here... now.
L298914	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
L298913	u1445	m97	OKUN/ALIEN	"Air... water... your ""sun."""
L298912	u1447	m97	PRESIDENT	Why did you people come here?
L300004	u1460	m98	SALLAH	The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
L300003	u1452	m98	BRODY	May we go home now, please?
L299639	u1452	m98	BRODY	Did you say...? Uh, uh...
L299638	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
L299637	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes.
L299635	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Papers, sir. Got it here.
L299634	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes.
L299630	u1460	m98	SALLAH	There is no museum in Iskenderun.
L299629	u1452	m98	BRODY	My reputation precedes me.
L299627	u1460	m98	SALLAH	And I am his.
L299626	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
L299623	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
L299622	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
L299621	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
L299620	u1460	m98	SALLAH	You are on your own?
L299619	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
L299618	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
L299617	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
L299952	u1457	m98	INDY	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
L299951	u1452	m98	BRODY	Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
L299475	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm going after Dad.
L299474	u1452	m98	BRODY	What about you?
L299473	u1457	m98	INDY	Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
L299472	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes. Now we know.
L299471	u1457	m98	INDY	Alexandretta. Now we know.
L299470	u1452	m98	BRODY	Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
L299468	u1452	m98	BRODY	Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
L299467	u1457	m98	INDY	"The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. ""Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.""  But where exactly?"
L299465	u1452	m98	BRODY	"It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. ""Alexandretta?"" Hmmm..."
L299464	u1457	m98	INDY	How's the head?
L299385	u1452	m98	BRODY	Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
L299384	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad was onto something here!
L299383	u1452	m98	BRODY	Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
L299381	u1452	m98	BRODY	Where?
L299380	u1457	m98	INDY	Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
L299376	u1452	m98	BRODY	It looks like a converted church.
L299375	u1457	m98	INDY	That doesn't look much like a library.
L299350	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
L299349	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
L299348	u1457	m98	INDY	Ah, Venice...
L299341	u1452	m98	BRODY	I'll tell him we'll take two.
L299340	u1457	m98	INDY	Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
L299339	u1452	m98	BRODY	But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
L299338	u1452	m98	BRODY	The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
L299337	u1457	m98	INDY	Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
L299336	u1457	m98	INDY	Do you believe, Marcus?
L299335	u1452	m98	BRODY	I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
L299334	u1457	m98	INDY	It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
L299333	u1452	m98	BRODY	What is it?
L299332	u1457	m98	INDY	Venice, Italy!
L299330	u1452	m98	BRODY	It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
L299329	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad?
L299328	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
L299327	u1452	m98	BRODY	What has the old fool got himself into now?
L299282	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes. My treat.
L299281	u1457	m98	INDY	Your treat.
L299279	u1452	m98	BRODY	Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
L299278	u1457	m98	INDY	All my life!
L299277	u1452	m98	BRODY	All your life.
L299276	u1457	m98	INDY	You know how long I've been looking for that?!
L299275	u1452	m98	BRODY	You've got it!
L299274	u1457	m98	INDY	Marcus!  I did it!
L300009	u1456	m98	HENRY	Got lost in his own museum, huh?
L300008	u1452	m98	BRODY	Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
L299942	u1456	m98	HENRY	The Name of God...
L299941	u1452	m98	BRODY	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
L299940	u1456	m98	HENRY	The Word of God...
L299890	u1456	m98	HENRY	It's war.
L299889	u1452	m98	BRODY	Look what you did!
L299888	u1452	m98	BRODY	But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
L299887	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299886	u1452	m98	BRODY	Henry, the pen --
L299862	u1456	m98	HENRY	It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
L299861	u1452	m98	BRODY	Henry! What are you doing here?!
L299858	u1452	m98	BRODY	Arghhh! Oh!
L299857	u1456	m98	HENRY	Marcus!
L299836	u1452	m98	BRODY	You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
L299835	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
L299833	u1452	m98	BRODY	I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
L299832	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
L299346	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
L299345	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
L299344	u1452	m98	BRODY	Schneider?
L299343	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
L299342	u1452	m98	BRODY	Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
L299511	u1457	m98	INDY	How dare he?!
L299510	u1453	m98	BUTLER	This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
L299509	u1457	m98	INDY	Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
L299508	u1453	m98	BUTLER	Tapestries?
L299507	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
L299506	u1453	m98	BUTLER	Are you expected?
L299935	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	We're through!
L299934	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm through!
L299918	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
L299917	u1457	m98	INDY	Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
L299916	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
L299915	u1457	m98	INDY	As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
L299914	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
L299602	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
L299601	u1457	m98	INDY	DONOVAN!
L299322	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
L299321	u1457	m98	INDY	You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
L299320	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
L299319	u1457	m98	INDY	Yes?
L299318	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	You could be more right than you know.
L299317	u1457	m98	INDY	That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
L299316	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	"This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two ""markers"" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those ""markers."" It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second ""marker"" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away."
L299315	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	"Not ""supposedly,"" Doctor Jones."
L299314	u1457	m98	INDY	I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
L299313	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	"Let me tell you another ""bedtime story,"" Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact."
L299312	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
L299311	u1457	m98	INDY	What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
L299310	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
L299306	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
L299305	u1457	m98	INDY	An old man's dream.
L299304	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
L299303	u1457	m98	INDY	The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
L299302	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
L299301	u1457	m98	INDY	Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.
L299298	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
L299297	u1457	m98	INDY	Where did this come from?
L299296	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	That was our assessment as well.
L299295	u1457	m98	INDY	Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
L299294	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
L299293	u1457	m98	INDY	I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
L299292	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
L299985	u1455	m98	ELSA	I can reach it. I can reach it...
L299984	u1457	m98	INDY	Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
L299982	u1457	m98	INDY	Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
L299981	u1455	m98	ELSA	It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
L299980	u1457	m98	INDY	Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
L299912	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
L299911	u1455	m98	ELSA	I never expected to see you again.
L299745	u1455	m98	ELSA	All I have to do is scream.
L299744	u1457	m98	INDY	All I have to do is squeeze.
L299743	u1455	m98	ELSA	You do.
L299742	u1457	m98	INDY	Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
L299741	u1455	m98	ELSA	Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
L299740	u1457	m98	INDY	My father didn't want it incinerated.
L299739	u1455	m98	ELSA	You came back for the book? Why?
L299738	u1457	m98	INDY	Where is it? I want it.
L299737	u1455	m98	ELSA	How did you get here?
L299606	u1457	m98	INDY	So it did.
L299605	u1455	m98	ELSA	This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
L299514	u1455	m98	ELSA	How do you know?
L299513	u1457	m98	INDY	This one. I think he's in here.
L299502	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't know. Think of something.
L299501	u1455	m98	ELSA	What are you going to do?
L299500	u1455	m98	ELSA	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
L299499	u1457	m98	INDY	What do you know about this place?
L299493	u1455	m98	ELSA	It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
L299492	u1457	m98	INDY	No. You like the way I do things.
L299491	u1455	m98	ELSA	No?
L299490	u1457	m98	INDY	Knock it off. You're not mad.
L299489	u1455	m98	ELSA	Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
L299488	u1457	m98	INDY	At least I let you tag along.
L299486	u1455	m98	ELSA	You had it? You didn't trust me!
L299485	u1457	m98	INDY	Uh-huh.
L299484	u1455	m98	ELSA	The Grail Diary.
L299483	u1457	m98	INDY	This.
L299482	u1455	m98	ELSA	What were they looking for?
L299481	u1457	m98	INDY	Mine, too.
L299480	u1455	m98	ELSA	My room!
L299442	u1457	m98	INDY	I said don't go between them!
L299441	u1455	m98	ELSA	You said go between them!
L299440	u1457	m98	INDY	I said go around!
L299434	u1455	m98	ELSA	What?
L299433	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't wander off.
L299429	u1457	m98	INDY	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
L299428	u1455	m98	ELSA	Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
L299426	u1457	m98	INDY	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
L299425	u1455	m98	ELSA	What's that?
L299422	u1455	m98	ELSA	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
L299421	u1457	m98	INDY	It must be one of these...
L299413	u1457	m98	INDY	Pretty sure.
L299412	u1455	m98	ELSA	Are you sure?
L299411	u1457	m98	INDY	The Ark of the Covenant.
L299407	u1455	m98	ELSA	The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
L299406	u1457	m98	INDY	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
L299405	u1455	m98	ELSA	Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
L299402	u1455	m98	ELSA	Lower me down.
L299401	u1457	m98	INDY	Except he's lost, and I'm not.
L299400	u1455	m98	ELSA	You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
L299399	u1457	m98	INDY	Bingo.
L299387	u1455	m98	ELSA	Find something?
L299386	u1457	m98	INDY	My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
L299369	u1457	m98	INDY	Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
L299368	u1455	m98	ELSA	But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
L299367	u1457	m98	INDY	It would make me very happy.
L299366	u1455	m98	ELSA	In that case, I permit you.
L299365	u1457	m98	INDY	I usually don't either.
L299364	u1455	m98	ELSA	I usually don't.
L299363	u1457	m98	INDY	Fraulein -- will you permit me?
L299362	u1457	m98	INDY	Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
L299361	u1455	m98	ELSA	The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
L299356	u1455	m98	ELSA	Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
L299355	u1457	m98	INDY	And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
L299353	u1455	m98	ELSA	I knew it was you --
L299352	u1457	m98	INDY	Yes?
L299351	u1455	m98	ELSA	Doctor Jones?
L300012	u1457	m98	INDY	Yes, sir!  Haaa!
L300011	u1456	m98	HENRY	After you, Junior.
L300010	u1457	m98	INDY	Uh-huh.
L300007	u1456	m98	HENRY	Ready.
L300006	u1457	m98	INDY	Ready?
L300002	u1456	m98	HENRY	We named the dog Indiana.
L300001	u1457	m98	INDY	I like Indiana.
L299998	u1457	m98	INDY	Junior?! Dad...
L299997	u1456	m98	HENRY	What did you find, Junior?
L299996	u1456	m98	HENRY	Me?... Illumination.
L299995	u1457	m98	INDY	What did you find, Dad?
L299994	u1456	m98	HENRY	Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
L299989	u1457	m98	INDY	I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
L299988	u1456	m98	HENRY	Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
L299945	u1457	m98	INDY	J.
L299944	u1456	m98	HENRY	"But in the Latin alphabet, ""Jehovah"" begins with an ""I""."
L299932	u1457	m98	INDY	The penitent man is humble...
L299931	u1456	m98	HENRY	Penitent. Penitent...
L299930	u1457	m98	INDY	The penitent man is humble before God.
L299929	u1456	m98	HENRY	The penitent man. The penitent...
L299928	u1457	m98	INDY	The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
L299927	u1456	m98	HENRY	Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.
L299920	u1456	m98	HENRY	Junior...
L299919	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad?!
L299894	u1457	m98	INDY	Get out of there, Dad!
L299893	u1456	m98	HENRY	You call this archaeology?
L299892	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad?
L299849	u1457	m98	INDY	Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
L299848	u1456	m98	HENRY	Now, who are all these people?
L299839	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, we're well out of range.
L299838	u1456	m98	HENRY	What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
L299810	u1457	m98	INDY	This could be close.
L299809	u1456	m98	HENRY	This is intolerable!
L299808	u1457	m98	INDY	It happens to me all the time.
L299807	u1456	m98	HENRY	It's a new experience for me.
L299806	u1457	m98	INDY	I know, Dad!
L299805	u1456	m98	HENRY	Those people are trying to kill us!
L299804	u1457	m98	INDY	Thanks.
L299803	u1456	m98	HENRY	Nice landing.
L299801	u1456	m98	HENRY	More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
L299800	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, are we hit?!
L299798	u1456	m98	HENRY	What happens at eleven o'clock?
L299797	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
L299794	u1457	m98	INDY	Fly... yes. Land... no.
L299793	u1456	m98	HENRY	I didn't know you could fly a plane.
L299789	u1456	m98	HENRY	I don't know. We'll find out.
L299788	u1457	m98	INDY	What does that mean?
L299787	u1456	m98	HENRY	"Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  ""First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."""
L299786	u1457	m98	INDY	Well... I can't think of anything.
L299784	u1456	m98	HENRY	Very well. I'm here now.
L299783	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, how can you?
L299782	u1456	m98	HENRY	You left just when you were becoming interesting.
L299781	u1457	m98	INDY	What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
L299780	u1456	m98	HENRY	Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
L299779	u1457	m98	INDY	When?
L299778	u1456	m98	HENRY	Actually, I was a wonderful father.
L299777	u1457	m98	INDY	A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
L299776	u1456	m98	HENRY	And do I detect a rebuke?
L299775	u1457	m98	INDY	We didn't talk. We never talked.
L299774	u1456	m98	HENRY	Hmmm... What did we talk about?
L299773	u1457	m98	INDY	Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
L299772	u1456	m98	HENRY	Ships that pass in the night...
L299771	u1457	m98	INDY	I was the next man.
L299770	u1456	m98	HENRY	Well, I'm as human as the next man.
L299769	u1457	m98	INDY	That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
L299768	u1456	m98	HENRY	You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
L299752	u1457	m98	INDY	Relax.
L299751	u1456	m98	HENRY	When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
L299749	u1456	m98	HENRY	Good.
L299748	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
L299747	u1456	m98	HENRY	What did you get?
L299734	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
L299733	u1457	m98	INDY	This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
L299732	u1456	m98	HENRY	That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
L299731	u1457	m98	INDY	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
L299730	u1456	m98	HENRY	Marcus would agree with me.
L299729	u1457	m98	INDY	What about Marcus?
L299728	u1456	m98	HENRY	Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
L299727	u1457	m98	INDY	Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
L299726	u1456	m98	HENRY	I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
L299725	u1457	m98	INDY	But what are they? Can't you remember?
L299724	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
L299723	u1457	m98	INDY	Booby traps?
L299722	u1456	m98	HENRY	Three devices of such lethal cunning.
L299721	u1457	m98	INDY	What final challenge?
L299720	u1456	m98	HENRY	Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
L299719	u1457	m98	INDY	All right Dad -- tell me.
L299718	u1456	m98	HENRY	There is more in the Diary than just the map.
L299717	u1457	m98	INDY	You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
L299716	u1456	m98	HENRY	My Diary's in Berlin.
L299715	u1457	m98	INDY	Brody's this way.
L299714	u1456	m98	HENRY	You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
L299713	u1456	m98	HENRY	Stop! Stop!
L299712	u1457	m98	INDY	What?
L299711	u1456	m98	HENRY	Stop!
L299707	u1456	m98	HENRY	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
L299706	u1457	m98	INDY	Come on, Dad. Come on!
L299702	u1456	m98	HENRY	...the solution presents itself.
L299701	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299695	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm out, Dad!
L299694	u1456	m98	HENRY	This is intolerable!
L299687	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh.
L299686	u1457	m98	INDY	Head for the fireplace!
L299685	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299684	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299683	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299682	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299681	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299680	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299675	u1457	m98	INDY	All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
L299674	u1456	m98	HENRY	And the chair.
L299673	u1457	m98	INDY	What???
L299672	u1456	m98	HENRY	The floor's on fire! See?!
L299671	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
L299670	u1456	m98	HENRY	I ought to tell you something.
L299668	u1457	m98	INDY	Try and burn through the ropes.
L299667	u1456	m98	HENRY	Feels like a cigarette lighter.
L299666	u1457	m98	INDY	My lucky charm.
L299665	u1456	m98	HENRY	What am I looking for?
L299663	u1457	m98	INDY	Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
L299662	u1456	m98	HENRY	You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
L299661	u1457	m98	INDY	Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
L299660	u1456	m98	HENRY	So did I.
L299659	u1457	m98	INDY	Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
L299598	u1456	m98	HENRY	She talks in her sleep.
L299597	u1457	m98	INDY	How did you she was a Nazi?
L299596	u1456	m98	HENRY	Umh?
L299595	u1457	m98	INDY	She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
L299587	u1456	m98	HENRY	Don't worry. He won't.
L299586	u1457	m98	INDY	No! Don't Shoot!
L299571	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
L299570	u1457	m98	INDY	I came here to save you.
L299569	u1456	m98	HENRY	Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
L299568	u1457	m98	INDY	Will you take it easy!
L299567	u1456	m98	HENRY	I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
L299566	u1457	m98	INDY	Look, can we discuss this later?
L299565	u1456	m98	HENRY	You did!!
L299564	u1457	m98	INDY	Well, uh...
L299563	u1456	m98	HENRY	You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
L299554	u1457	m98	INDY	Yeah?
L299553	u1456	m98	HENRY	They want my diary.
L299552	u1457	m98	INDY	Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
L299551	u1456	m98	HENRY	Rats?
L299550	u1457	m98	INDY	There were rats, Dad.
L299549	u1456	m98	HENRY	If only I could have been with you.
L299548	u1457	m98	INDY	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
L299547	u1456	m98	HENRY	...you did it.
L299546	u1456	m98	HENRY	Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
L299545	u1457	m98	INDY	Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
L299544	u1456	m98	HENRY	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
L299543	u1457	m98	INDY	Well, what was left of him.
L299542	u1456	m98	HENRY	He was actually there? You saw him?
L299541	u1457	m98	INDY	Found it.
L299540	u1456	m98	HENRY	I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
L299539	u1457	m98	INDY	Right.
L299538	u1456	m98	HENRY	Through the library?
L299537	u1457	m98	INDY	I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
L299536	u1456	m98	HENRY	Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
L299534	u1456	m98	HENRY	Good point.
L299533	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, they come in through the doors.
L299532	u1456	m98	HENRY	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
L299531	u1457	m98	INDY	No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
L299529	u1456	m98	HENRY	Thank God!
L299528	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
L299527	u1456	m98	HENRY	I'll never forgive myself --
L299526	u1457	m98	INDY	And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
L299525	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh, it breaks the heart.
L299523	u1457	m98	INDY	I came to get you! What do you think?
L299522	u1456	m98	HENRY	But what are you doing here?
L299521	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't call me that, please.
L299520	u1456	m98	HENRY	It is you Junior!
L299246	u1456	m98	HENRY	Junior!
L299245	u1457	m98	INDY	No, Dad. You listen to me --
L299244	u1456	m98	HENRY	Then wait -- count to twenty.
L299243	u1457	m98	INDY	It's important!
L299242	u1456	m98	HENRY	Out!
L299241	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299961	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
L299960	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
L299959	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
L299958	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	A long time to wait.
L299957	u1457	m98	INDY	That was seven hundred years ago.
L299956	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
L299955	u1457	m98	INDY	Who are you?
L299954	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
L299876	u1460	m98	SALLAH	They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
L299875	u1457	m98	INDY	Where's my father?
L299874	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
L299873	u1457	m98	INDY	Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
L299854	u1457	m98	INDY	No camels!
L299853	u1460	m98	SALLAH	But, Indy --
L299852	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't need camels.
L299851	u1460	m98	SALLAH	I'll take the camels.
L299850	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm going after those horses.
L299841	u1457	m98	INDY	Come on -- come on!
L299840	u1460	m98	SALLAH	That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
L299829	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
L299828	u1457	m98	INDY	What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
L299827	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Get that camel out of the way!
L299463	u1458	m98	KAZIM	In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
L299462	u1457	m98	INDY	I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
L299461	u1458	m98	KAZIM	Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
L299459	u1458	m98	KAZIM	The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
L299458	u1457	m98	INDY	And why were you trying to kill me?
L299457	u1458	m98	KAZIM	My name is Kazim.
L299456	u1457	m98	INDY	Who are you?
L299455	u1458	m98	KAZIM	If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
L299454	u1457	m98	INDY	All right! Where's my father
L299453	u1458	m98	KAZIM	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
L299452	u1457	m98	INDY	This is your last chance.
L299451	u1458	m98	KAZIM	My soul is prepared. How's yours?
L299450	u1457	m98	INDY	Then we'll die.
L299449	u1458	m98	KAZIM	If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
L299448	u1457	m98	INDY	Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
L299447	u1458	m98	KAZIM	No.
L299446	u1457	m98	INDY	My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
L299445	u1458	m98	KAZIM	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
L299444	u1457	m98	INDY	Why are you trying to kill us?
L300572	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
L300571	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
L300570	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
L300343	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
L300342	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
L300312	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
L300311	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Just a routine inspection tour.
L300310	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	"Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the ""natives""."
L300568	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
L300567	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
L300565	u1463	m99	INDIANA	When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
L300564	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Miss Scott panicked?
L300563	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
L300380	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
L300379	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
L300360	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Something magical. A sacred rock.
L300359	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
L300326	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
L300325	u1463	m99	INDIANA	The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
L300324	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
L300323	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
L300322	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
L300321	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You think so?
L300320	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
L300319	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
L300318	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Charming.
L300317	u1463	m99	INDIANA	No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
L300316	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Interested in local curios?
L300551	u1468	m99	WILLIE	It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
L300550	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Who?
L300547	u1468	m99	WILLIE	We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
L300546	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	What?
L300545	u1468	m99	WILLIE	No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
L300544	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
L300329	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Finally!
L300328	u1461	m99	CAPT. BLUMBURTT	I believe we're being called to dinner.
L300553	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
L300552	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
L300549	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
L300548	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
L300315	u1468	m99	WILLIE	No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
L300314	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
L300313	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
L300303	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
L300302	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
L300301	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
L300300	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
L300299	u1468	m99	WILLIE	"He's not exactly what we call ""a spring chicken""."
L300295	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You should have been there...
L300294	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
L300291	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
L300290	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Hard to believe, isn't it...?
L300594	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
L300593	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	You understand what he tells us?
L300588	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Yes, I understand.
L300587	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
L300372	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
L300371	u1463	m99	INDIANA	That was a misunderstanding.
L300370	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
L300369	u1463	m99	INDIANA	The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
L300368	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
L300367	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
L300363	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
L300362	u1463	m99	INDIANA	When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
L300361	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	There, you see, Captain. A rock!
L300358	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
L300357	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
L300356	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
L300350	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
L300349	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Their stories are just fear and folklore.
L300348	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
L300347	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	There are no stories anymore.
L300346	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
L300341	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
L300340	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
L300339	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
L300297	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
L300296	u1463	m99	INDIANA	We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
L300289	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
L300288	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
L300287	u1462	m99	CHATTAR LAL	I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
L300046	u1464	m99	LAO	At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
L300045	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Now what about the antidote, Lao.
L300040	u1464	m99	LAO	A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
L300039	u1463	m99	INDIANA	What's that?
L300025	u1464	m99	LAO	Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
L300024	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
L300023	u1464	m99	LAO	You have insulted my son.
L300021	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
L300020	u1464	m99	LAO	So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
L300018	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I don't like to show off.
L300017	u1464	m99	LAO	You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
L300015	u1464	m99	LAO	Nee chin lie how ma?
L300014	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Lao She.
L300013	u1464	m99	LAO	Dr. Jones.
L300651	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	What?
L300650	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Let up on the brake!
L300649	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Read you loud and clear, Indy!
L300648	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
L300625	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Behind you!
L300624	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Come one, what's wrong?
L300516	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Why?
L300515	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
L300499	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.
L300498	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Why they glow like that?
L300497	u1463	m99	INDIANA	The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
L300441	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth.
L300440	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	What does it mean, Indy?
L300422	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
L300421	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
L300395	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Yeah, that's what happened...
L300394	u1463	m99	INDIANA	He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
L300393	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
L300392	u1463	m99	INDIANA	No.
L300391	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
L300390	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You don't like him do you?
L300389	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
L300276	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Just a statue.
L300275	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	What you look at, Indy?
L300273	u1463	m99	INDIANA	That's it. Pankot Palace.
L300272	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Indy, look!
L300185	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
L300184	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	I ride with you, Indy?
L300159	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
L300158	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
L300122	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Okay, Shorty.
L300121	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Indy?
L300081	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
L300080	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You got the tickets, Short Round?
L300067	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
L300066	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Step on it, Short Round!
L300065	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
L300688	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You're betrayed Shiva. 
L300687	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	No, the stones are mine!
L300685	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
L300684	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	Give me the stones!
L300679	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
L300678	u1463	m99	INDIANA	That's far enough!
L300532	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
L300531	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
L300530	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
L300529	u1463	m99	INDIANA	That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
L300528	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
L300527	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Two are still missing.
L300526	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
L300525	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
L300524	u1465	m99	MOLA RAM	You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
L300173	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
L300172	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
L300166	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
L300165	u1463	m99	INDIANA	But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
L300163	u1463	m99	INDIANA	And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
L300162	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	Long ago -- before my father's father.
L300161	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
L300157	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
L300156	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
L300155	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	It is why Krishna brought you here.
L300152	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
L300151	u1463	m99	INDIANA	What evil?
L300150	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
L300149	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I don't understand. What's happened here?
L300148	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
L300147	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
L300146	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
L300145	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	You will go to palace there.
L300144	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
L300143	u1466	m99	SHAMAN	On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
L300702	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
L300701	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
L300700	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
L300699	u1468	m99	WILLIE	And they don't even know what it really is.
L300698	u1463	m99	INDIANA	The last Sankara Stone.
L300691	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Not quite.
L300690	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
L300659	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
L300658	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Anymore ideas...?
L300653	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What above the curves?!
L300652	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
L300621	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Go!
L300620	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I can't!
L300616	u1463	m99	INDIANA	There's got to be another way out.
L300615	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What're we going to do?!
L300581	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
L300580	u1463	m99	INDIANA	No... they won't kill me.
L300579	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
L300577	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Yes, they believe you.
L300576	u1468	m99	WILLIE	So now they believe me.
L300575	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Yes.
L300574	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Indy? Did you talk to them?
L300562	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
L300561	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I want to go home...
L300560	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You've got to go to sleep now.
L300559	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What?
L300557	u1468	m99	WILLIE	They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
L300556	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It's okay. You're all right now.
L300507	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Maybe... someday.  Not today.
L300506	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
L300505	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I'm not leaving without those stones.
L300504	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
L300503	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I'm going down.
L300502	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Wait -- what're you doing?
L300496	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Quiet!
L300495	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Let's go! Let's get out of here!
L300492	u1463	m99	INDIANA	No... the heart's still beating!
L300491	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
L300490	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
L300489	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What is it...?
L300484	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Willie!
L300483	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
L300479	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I am -- it looks horrible!
L300478	u1463	m99	INDIANA	That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
L300477	u1468	m99	WILLIE	There's a hole! I found a square hole!
L300475	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
L300474	u1463	m99	INDIANA	A fulcrum release lever!
L300473	u1468	m99	WILLIE	A what?!
L300472	u1463	m99	INDIANA	GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
L300470	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
L300469	u1468	m99	WILLIE	There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
L300465	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
L300464	u1463	m99	INDIANA	WILLIE?!
L300460	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
L300459	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What?!
L300436	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
L300435	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
L300434	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Oh no -- oh no!!
L300432	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
L300431	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Get -- the -- bug -- off!
L300430	u1463	m99	INDIANA	What -- the bug?
L300429	u1468	m99	WILLIE	No -- don't you see -- crawling --
L300417	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
L300416	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
L300415	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Dr. Jones?
L300414	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Don't catch cold.
L300413	u1468	m99	WILLIE	We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
L300412	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
L300411	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
L300410	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
L300409	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
L300408	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You're talking to an authority in that area.
L300407	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Primitive sexual practices?
L300404	u1463	m99	INDIANA	"I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain ""nocturnal activities"" --"
L300403	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
L300402	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
L300401	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
L300399	u1463	m99	INDIANA	No -- real food.
L300398	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Not leftovers?
L300334	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I've never been so hungry in my life...
L300333	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
L300332	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Maybe he likes older women.
L300331	u1468	m99	WILLIE	That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
L300308	u1468	m99	WILLIE	She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
L300307	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
L300283	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
L300282	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Any more complaints?
L300280	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
L300279	u1463	m99	INDIANA	He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
L300278	u1468	m99	WILLIE	He's afraid of something.
L300268	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Just try and control yourself.
L300267	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Couldn't keep away, huh?
L300265	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
L300264	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
L300261	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
L300260	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
L300259	u1468	m99	WILLIE	That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
L300258	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
L300257	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What does the writing say?
L300256	u1463	m99	INDIANA	The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
L300253	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Maybe...
L300252	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
L300251	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
L300250	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Oh really?
L300249	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I'd like to find one of those myself.
L300248	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
L300247	u1463	m99	INDIANA	What about the future?
L300246	u1468	m99	WILLIE	"Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that ""a girl could go places in the Orient..."" So, look where I got."
L300245	u1463	m99	INDIANA	By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
L300243	u1468	m99	WILLIE	He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
L300242	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
L300241	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
L300240	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
L300238	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I know the feeling...
L300237	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
L300234	u1463	m99	INDIANA	That's good -- you're doing fine.
L300233	u1468	m99	WILLIE	It's starting to let go!
L300232	u1463	m99	INDIANA	What's happening?
L300231	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Keep stroking it!
L300230	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
L300229	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
L300228	u1468	m99	WILLIE	THE WHAT?!
L300227	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
L300226	u1468	m99	WILLIE	PET IT??!!
L300225	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
L300224	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Just one arm!
L300223	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Can you move your arm?
L300222	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What?!
L300221	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
L300219	u1468	m99	WILLIE	It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
L300218	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Don't let it curl around you!
L300217	u1468	m99	WILLIE	It's pulling me deeper!
L300216	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Don't let it pull you deeper!
L300214	u1463	m99	INDIANA	First of all -- don't panic!
L300213	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What?!
L300212	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
L300211	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
L300210	u1468	m99	WILLIE	A SNAKE!!
L300209	u1463	m99	INDIANA	A what...?
L300208	u1468	m99	WILLIE	A snake!
L300207	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
L300206	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Indy! Help me!
L300205	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Somehow I feel safer in here.
L300204	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
L300203	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
L300202	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
L300179	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
L300178	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What'd he say now?
L300170	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Their children?
L300169	u1463	m99	INDIANA	And then they took their children.
L300154	u1463	m99	INDIANA	It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
L300153	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Took what?
L300135	u1463	m99	INDIANA	That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
L300134	u1468	m99	WILLIE	God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
L300132	u1463	m99	INDIANA	He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
L300131	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
L300130	u1463	m99	INDIANA	The old man saw it in a dream.
L300129	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What do you mean -- how?
L300128	u1463	m99	INDIANA	He told me they knew I was coming here.
L300127	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What'd he say?
L300126	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
L300125	u1463	m99	INDIANA	India...
L300124	u1468	m99	WILLIE	No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
L300123	u1463	m99	INDIANA	You all right?
L300119	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
L300118	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
L300093	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Oh yeah?
L300092	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
L300091	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
L300090	u1468	m99	WILLIE	So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
L300086	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
L300085	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Siam.
L300084	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
L300079	u1463	m99	INDIANA	The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
L300078	u1468	m99	WILLIE	What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
L300073	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
L300072	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You don't look very good.
L300071	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
L300070	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
L300069	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
L300068	u1468	m99	WILLIE	For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
L300059	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Who cares? Where's that diamond!
L300058	u1463	m99	INDIANA	Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
L300053	u1463	m99	INDIANA	No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.
L300052	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Hey, he's not a waiter...
L300051	u1463	m99	INDIANA	I like the service here.
L300642	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	Willie, come on!
L300641	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
L300355	u1468	m99	WILLIE	I'm going to puke in it...
L300354	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	What for?
L300353	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Give me your hat...
L300190	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
L300189	u1468	m99	WILLIE	Figures...
L300188	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
L300187	u1468	m99	WILLIE	This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
L300115	u1468	m99	WILLIE	You got it!
L300114	u1467	m99	SHORT ROUND	I get it!
L303627	u1469	m100	AL	Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
L303626	u1475	m100	JOE	What are you doing?
L303551	u1475	m100	JOE	That's nice.
L303550	u1469	m100	AL	In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
L303543	u1469	m100	AL	Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
L303542	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll get us out of here.
L303541	u1469	m100	AL	Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
L303537	u1469	m100	AL	I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
L303536	u1475	m100	JOE	Awwww...
L303533	u1475	m100	JOE	I want to thank you for what you've done.
L303532	u1469	m100	AL	I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
L303531	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
L303528	u1475	m100	JOE	You're lovely.
L303527	u1469	m100	AL	She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
L303523	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah, sure.
L303522	u1469	m100	AL	You're a lucky man.
L303515	u1475	m100	JOE	They can?
L303514	u1469	m100	AL	She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
L303513	u1469	m100	AL	I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
L303508	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh no!
L303507	u1469	m100	AL	Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
L303506	u1469	m100	AL	Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
L303503	u1475	m100	JOE	You've changed your mind.
L303502	u1469	m100	AL	She is beautiful.
L303491	u1475	m100	JOE	No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
L303490	u1469	m100	AL	I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
L303489	u1475	m100	JOE	You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
L303488	u1469	m100	AL	Now, you're too suspicious.
L303487	u1475	m100	JOE	She works for them.
L303486	u1469	m100	AL	Rene?
L303485	u1475	m100	JOE	Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
L303484	u1469	m100	AL	About what?
L303483	u1475	m100	JOE	I have been... I think you're right.
L303482	u1469	m100	AL	Keep thinking.
L303481	u1475	m100	JOE	I can always flush you down the toilet.
L303480	u1475	m100	JOE	Looks like you can have all you want.
L303479	u1469	m100	AL	Gimme a minute.
L303478	u1475	m100	JOE	We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
L303477	u1469	m100	AL	Never mind that, where are we now.
L303476	u1475	m100	JOE	Where've you been?
L303475	u1469	m100	AL	Be quiet.
L303466	u1469	m100	AL	Losing power. The laser drained it.
L303465	u1475	m100	JOE	What happened?
L303456	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know.
L303455	u1469	m100	AL	What exactly?
L303454	u1475	m100	JOE	Do something.
L303450	u1469	m100	AL	Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
L303449	u1475	m100	JOE	Pretty advanced, isn't it?
L303432	u1475	m100	JOE	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
L303431	u1469	m100	AL	This may hurt.
L303430	u1469	m100	AL	And don't let her know, either.
L303429	u1475	m100	JOE	There's a lot you don't know.
L303415	u1469	m100	AL	GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
L303414	u1475	m100	JOE	Dieter!
L303413	u1469	m100	AL	The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
L303412	u1475	m100	JOE	He aready made the deal..
L303410	u1469	m100	AL	...Shit! It's just money.
L303409	u1475	m100	JOE	Holy...
L303401	u1475	m100	JOE	Aim what?
L303400	u1469	m100	AL	Aim just in front of his face.
L303396	u1475	m100	JOE	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
L303395	u1469	m100	AL	Are you alright?
L303386	u1469	m100	AL	Don't worry, I can.
L303385	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't handle that thing.
L303384	u1469	m100	AL	Do it.
L303382	u1469	m100	AL	He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
L303381	u1475	m100	JOE	Then, why'd he lead us here.
L303380	u1469	m100	AL	He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
L303379	u1475	m100	JOE	And Dieter?
L303378	u1469	m100	AL	It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
L303349	u1475	m100	JOE	Where?
L303348	u1469	m100	AL	While he makes the run.
L303347	u1475	m100	JOE	He hung us up dry.
L303341	u1469	m100	AL	It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
L303340	u1475	m100	JOE	Well...?
L303339	u1469	m100	AL	Left...The one with the red dot.
L303332	u1469	m100	AL	Cash.
L303331	u1475	m100	JOE	haka xuki. What's that mean?
L303330	u1469	m100	AL	haka xuki.
L303329	u1469	m100	AL	You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
L303328	u1475	m100	JOE	What was it? What'd I say?
L303326	u1469	m100	AL	Just say the words. Just like I told you.
L303325	u1475	m100	JOE	Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
L303324	u1469	m100	AL	Not sure at all.
L303323	u1475	m100	JOE	You sure this will work?
L303320	u1475	m100	JOE	I was afraid of that.
L303319	u1469	m100	AL	I've got an idea.
L303318	u1469	m100	AL	Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
L303311	u1475	m100	JOE	Come on.
L303310	u1469	m100	AL	It's him.
L303295	u1475	m100	JOE	Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
L303294	u1469	m100	AL	I don't trust her.
L303293	u1475	m100	JOE	Probably.
L303292	u1469	m100	AL	Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
L303275	u1469	m100	AL	No. You can't trust her.
L303274	u1475	m100	JOE	I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
L303249	u1475	m100	JOE	You were with GRUNER!
L303248	u1469	m100	AL	He was with Gruner!
L303242	u1469	m100	AL	Never mind, just say it.
L303241	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L303225	u1469	m100	AL	Neither can they.
L303224	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't see a thing.
L303223	u1469	m100	AL	Door to the right. Get up and run.
L303222	u1469	m100	AL	A hard left. A hard left.
L303221	u1475	m100	JOE	Ow!
L303213	u1469	m100	AL	Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
L303212	u1475	m100	JOE	What are you doing?
L303210	u1475	m100	JOE	...imagine a better grape for the region.
L303209	u1469	m100	AL	You have to! Quickly!
L303208	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't...
L303205	u1469	m100	AL	Drink lots of water.
L303204	u1475	m100	JOE	What next!
L303199	u1475	m100	JOE	Too late.
L303198	u1469	m100	AL	...drink it.
L303190	u1475	m100	JOE	Don't worry!
L303189	u1469	m100	AL	Don't touch a thing.
L303184	u1475	m100	JOE	I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
L303183	u1469	m100	AL	One of your instincts?
L303182	u1475	m100	JOE	I told you, I have a feeling...
L303181	u1469	m100	AL	Yeah...You've fallen for her.
L303148	u1475	m100	JOE	You think. That's what you're good at.
L303147	u1469	m100	AL	What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
L303146	u1475	m100	JOE	It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
L303145	u1469	m100	AL	Relax. Make your mind a blank.
L303144	u1469	m100	AL	Relax. Let me do this.
L303143	u1475	m100	JOE	What do I do?
L303142	u1469	m100	AL	`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
L303135	u1475	m100	JOE	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
L303134	u1469	m100	AL	Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
L303133	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are you going?
L303132	u1469	m100	AL	Just stay here and rest.
L303131	u1475	m100	JOE	Sapporo..
L303130	u1469	m100	AL	That's not funny.
L303129	u1475	m100	JOE	Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
L303126	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't keep up.
L303125	u1469	m100	AL	Come on, she's getting away.
L303124	u1469	m100	AL	Run, stupid!
L303123	u1475	m100	JOE	On what?
L303122	u1469	m100	AL	Follow her.
L303121	u1475	m100	JOE	What do I do?
L303120	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
L303119	u1469	m100	AL	We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
L303118	u1475	m100	JOE	Don't you think I stand out like this.
L303117	u1469	m100	AL	Fountainhead of High-Tech.
L303116	u1475	m100	JOE	Osaka?
L303115	u1469	m100	AL	Osaka.
L303114	u1475	m100	JOE	That's good. It's not better. Where?
L303113	u1469	m100	AL	Better. I found Ryuji.
L303112	u1475	m100	JOE	You found her.
L303111	u1469	m100	AL	Bingo.
L303110	u1475	m100	JOE	Why don't you get out of my face.
L303109	u1469	m100	AL	Some agent you are.
L303108	u1475	m100	JOE	It wasn't like that.
L303107	u1469	m100	AL	You been had. We have.
L303103	u1469	m100	AL	I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
L303102	u1475	m100	JOE	No. What will you do.
L303101	u1475	m100	JOE	No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
L303096	u1469	m100	AL	You get time off to sleep.
L303095	u1475	m100	JOE	It's not your time. I get time off.
L303094	u1469	m100	AL	And on my time.
L303093	u1469	m100	AL	Shit! You're in love.
L303092	u1475	m100	JOE	She's got the most beautiful...s
L303090	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
L303089	u1469	m100	AL	Is that all?
L303088	u1475	m100	JOE	Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
L303087	u1469	m100	AL	What she say. What'd you get out of her?
L303086	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know!
L303085	u1469	m100	AL	What Happened?
L303055	u1475	m100	JOE	I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
L303054	u1469	m100	AL	Joe! It's 56 hours!
L303053	u1475	m100	JOE	You shut down your sensors.
L303052	u1469	m100	AL	Oh come on.
L303051	u1475	m100	JOE	You got any books in there?
L303050	u1469	m100	AL	What am I supposed to do?
L303049	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
L303048	u1469	m100	AL	What if she says something important?
L303047	u1475	m100	JOE	It's embarrassing.
L303046	u1475	m100	JOE	You can't listen. You can't watch either.
L303045	u1469	m100	AL	What is it?
L303044	u1475	m100	JOE	Not her. You!
L303043	u1469	m100	AL	You're doing great with her.
L303042	u1475	m100	JOE	This just won't work.
L303041	u1469	m100	AL	What is it, your charm?
L303023	u1475	m100	JOE	Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
L303022	u1469	m100	AL	Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
L303021	u1475	m100	JOE	Maybe she's telling the truth.
L303020	u1469	m100	AL	She's the toughest to read.
L303019	u1475	m100	JOE	Even Rene?
L303018	u1475	m100	JOE	Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
L303017	u1469	m100	AL	Voice stress analyzer.
L303016	u1475	m100	JOE	How do you know?
L303015	u1469	m100	AL	They're all in it.
L303009	u1475	m100	JOE	...I've lost something. I must get it back.
L303008	u1469	m100	AL	Joe, be careful!
L302982	u1469	m100	AL	Don't get too cute.
L302981	u1475	m100	JOE	My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
L302980	u1469	m100	AL	He recognises you, throw him off.
L302969	u1469	m100	AL	It lends you an air of mystery.
L302968	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know what's going on.
L302967	u1469	m100	AL	Just don't show fear.
L302962	u1475	m100	JOE	Killer!
L302961	u1469	m100	AL	The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
L302960	u1475	m100	JOE	Which one?
L302956	u1469	m100	AL	Just hold them close and stay still.
L302955	u1475	m100	JOE	I feel like an idiot.
L302950	u1475	m100	JOE	Are you serious?
L302949	u1469	m100	AL	Follow that busboy.
L302948	u1469	m100	AL	The drinks...Stay on them.
L302947	u1475	m100	JOE	What glasses.
L302946	u1469	m100	AL	Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
L302943	u1475	m100	JOE	That's a big if.
L302942	u1469	m100	AL	Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
L302941	u1475	m100	JOE	You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
L302940	u1475	m100	JOE	Who, me?
L302939	u1469	m100	AL	You're not just after this girl, are you?
L302921	u1475	m100	JOE	That place. By the window.
L302920	u1469	m100	AL	Get close to them.
L302916	u1475	m100	JOE	You have no taste.
L302915	u1469	m100	AL	They both look good to me.
L302914	u1475	m100	JOE	The beautiful one.
L302913	u1469	m100	AL	Which one is she?
L302912	u1469	m100	AL	Doesn't.
L302911	u1475	m100	JOE	You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
L302910	u1469	m100	AL	What did that cost?
L302904	u1475	m100	JOE	Why not?!
L302903	u1469	m100	AL	Not that tie with that coat.
L302900	u1475	m100	JOE	But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
L302899	u1469	m100	AL	It is my business. It's my name.
L302898	u1475	m100	JOE	Mind your own business.
L302896	u1475	m100	JOE	Not blue enough.
L302895	u1469	m100	AL	Much too blue.
L302891	u1475	m100	JOE	This...is not going to work out.
L302890	u1469	m100	AL	You really like that shirt?
L302889	u1469	m100	AL	Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
L302888	u1475	m100	JOE	What is it?
L302885	u1469	m100	AL	Is something glinting?
L302884	u1475	m100	JOE	What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
L302883	u1469	m100	AL	But what's it look like?
L302881	u1469	m100	AL	What are you looking at?
L302880	u1475	m100	JOE	Now, where would I be?
L302876	u1469	m100	AL	But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
L302875	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah. I did it.
L302874	u1469	m100	AL	Well you did it today.
L302873	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
L302872	u1475	m100	JOE	Rene...
L302871	u1469	m100	AL	You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
L302870	u1475	m100	JOE	I made it work.
L302869	u1469	m100	AL	It worked.
L302868	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
L302867	u1469	m100	AL	Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
L302866	u1475	m100	JOE	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
L302865	u1469	m100	AL	Without your pants.
L302864	u1475	m100	JOE	To the hotel. To register.
L302863	u1469	m100	AL	Where are you going?
L302862	u1475	m100	JOE	...Rene...
L302861	u1469	m100	AL	What happened?
L302851	u1469	m100	AL	No...you idiot!
L302850	u1475	m100	JOE	...Joe.
L302836	u1469	m100	AL	Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
L302835	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L302834	u1469	m100	AL	Touch her.
L302828	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are you staying?
L302827	u1469	m100	AL	Where is she staying?
L302826	u1475	m100	JOE	Wait.
L302825	u1469	m100	AL	Wait.
L302813	u1475	m100	JOE	.
L302812	u1469	m100	AL	.
L302797	u1469	m100	AL	Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
L302796	u1475	m100	JOE	What?
L302795	u1469	m100	AL	Don't just stand there, say something.
L302794	u1475	m100	JOE	What do I do?
L302791	u1469	m100	AL	What can I do? You're on your own.
L302790	u1475	m100	JOE	Help me out, will you?
L302787	u1469	m100	AL	How should I know?
L302786	u1475	m100	JOE	Which language?
L302785	u1469	m100	AL	Try another language.
L302784	u1475	m100	JOE	She doesn't seem to understand.
L302783	u1469	m100	AL	What's happening?
L302782	u1475	m100	JOE	You're beautiful..
L302780	u1475	m100	JOE	She's beautiful...! What do I do?
L302779	u1469	m100	AL	What is it?
L302778	u1469	m100	AL	You're out of shape.
L302777	u1475	m100	JOE	She's...pretty fast.
L302774	u1469	m100	AL	Follow it.
L302773	u1475	m100	JOE	This must be business, there's nothing else here.
L302772	u1475	m100	JOE	A girl.
L302771	u1469	m100	AL	What was?
L302770	u1475	m100	JOE	Beautiful!
L302768	u1475	m100	JOE	Are you screwing with any nerves?
L302767	u1469	m100	AL	What? What do you mean?
L302766	u1475	m100	JOE	Al, are you doing anything in there?
L302763	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are you going? Wait!
L302762	u1469	m100	AL	Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
L302761	u1469	m100	AL	For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
L302760	u1475	m100	JOE	It's sand.
L302759	u1469	m100	AL	Why not?
L302758	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't want to eat it.
L302757	u1469	m100	AL	Eat it.
L302756	u1475	m100	JOE	Eat it?
L302755	u1469	m100	AL	The sand.
L302754	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what?
L302753	u1469	m100	AL	I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
L302752	u1475	m100	JOE	You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
L302751	u1469	m100	AL	You eat it.
L302750	u1475	m100	JOE	Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
L302749	u1475	m100	JOE	Little late for that.
L302748	u1469	m100	AL	Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
L302747	u1475	m100	JOE	Good Idea!
L302746	u1469	m100	AL	Swim.
L302745	u1475	m100	JOE	The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
L302744	u1469	m100	AL	Do you notice anything.
L302743	u1475	m100	JOE	...Just beautiful.
L302742	u1469	m100	AL	What is it?
L302741	u1475	m100	JOE	Holy shit!
L302740	u1469	m100	AL	Just get there.
L302739	u1475	m100	JOE	Eating sushi?
L302738	u1469	m100	AL	How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
L302737	u1475	m100	JOE	The beach?
L302736	u1469	m100	AL	The beach.
L302735	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what?
L302732	u1475	m100	JOE	You leave my glands alone!
L302731	u1469	m100	AL	Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
L302730	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
L302729	u1469	m100	AL	You'll be me.
L302728	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh yeah, to what?
L302727	u1469	m100	AL	Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
L302726	u1475	m100	JOE	What's wrong with how I carry myself.
L302725	u1469	m100	AL	It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
L302724	u1475	m100	JOE	It's just not enough.
L302723	u1469	m100	AL	We'll change your appearance.
L302722	u1475	m100	JOE	They'll know who I am.
L302720	u1469	m100	AL	Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
L302719	u1475	m100	JOE	...and a license to kill...
L302717	u1469	m100	AL	You are in trouble. Now do it.
L302716	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll get in trouble.
L302715	u1469	m100	AL	Who cares?
L302714	u1475	m100	JOE	It's illegal.
L302713	u1469	m100	AL	Why not?
L302712	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't do that.
L302711	u1469	m100	AL	Use my credit cards.
L302710	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't have any.
L302709	u1469	m100	AL	What about it?
L302708	u1475	m100	JOE	What about money?
L302706	u1475	m100	JOE	We get on which plane?
L302705	u1469	m100	AL	We get on a plane.
L302704	u1475	m100	JOE	You mean...just leave.
L302701	u1469	m100	AL	You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
L302700	u1475	m100	JOE	Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
L302699	u1469	m100	AL	Send a man there. A secret agent.
L302698	u1475	m100	JOE	What do we do?
L302693	u1469	m100	AL	Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
L302692	u1475	m100	JOE	What is it?
L302689	u1469	m100	AL	Nothing. You just do nothing.
L302688	u1475	m100	JOE	What am I supposed to do?
L302687	u1469	m100	AL	Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
L302685	u1469	m100	AL	Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
L302684	u1475	m100	JOE	Who is it?
L302682	u1469	m100	AL	Good. Get to a phone.
L302681	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm at the airport.
L302680	u1469	m100	AL	I'm back.
L302678	u1475	m100	JOE	The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
L302677	u1469	m100	AL	I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
L302676	u1475	m100	JOE	Just scratched my arm, why?
L302675	u1469	m100	AL	Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
L302674	u1475	m100	JOE	Nothing!
L302673	u1469	m100	AL	Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
L302671	u1469	m100	AL	You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
L302670	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
L302669	u1469	m100	AL	You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
L302668	u1475	m100	JOE	You need ID in there?
L302667	u1469	m100	AL	Don't know.
L302666	u1475	m100	JOE	Gone where?
L302665	u1469	m100	AL	They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
L302664	u1475	m100	JOE	That's not a good idea.
L302663	u1469	m100	AL	That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
L302662	u1475	m100	JOE	Black suits and helmets.
L302661	u1469	m100	AL	What do you mean?
L302660	u1475	m100	JOE	Like the guys that attacked us.
L302658	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't remember..
L302657	u1469	m100	AL	Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
L302655	u1475	m100	JOE	The man.
L302654	u1469	m100	AL	Who did?
L302653	u1475	m100	JOE	I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
L302652	u1469	m100	AL	Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
L302651	u1475	m100	JOE	A lab and equipment.
L302647	u1475	m100	JOE	Where are we going?
L302646	u1469	m100	AL	Take a left and your next right.
L302645	u1475	m100	JOE	Corridor A.
L302644	u1469	m100	AL	What does it say.
L302643	u1475	m100	JOE	Which way do I go?
L302642	u1469	m100	AL	With Authority!
L302641	u1475	m100	JOE	Just walk down the hall?
L302640	u1469	m100	AL	Go out, take your first left.
L302639	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what.
L302638	u1469	m100	AL	See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
L302637	u1475	m100	JOE	Door's locked.
L302636	u1469	m100	AL	We have to get out of here.
L302635	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't like the sound of that.
L302630	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll sue.
L302629	u1469	m100	AL	Sue them.
L302611	u1475	m100	JOE	Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
L302610	u1469	m100	AL	They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
L302609	u1469	m100	AL	I'm not gonna make it easy.
L302608	u1475	m100	JOE	Find You?
L302607	u1469	m100	AL	Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
L302602	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm not leaving until you do.
L302601	u1469	m100	AL	Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
L302600	u1475	m100	JOE	Thanks.
L302599	u1469	m100	AL	We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
L302598	u1475	m100	JOE	I did. I brought you back here.
L302597	u1469	m100	AL	You gotta help.
L302596	u1475	m100	JOE	What do you mean we.
L302595	u1469	m100	AL	You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
L302594	u1475	m100	JOE	You are CRAZY!
L302593	u1469	m100	AL	I am. You are.
L302592	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah...Who is?
L302591	u1469	m100	AL	"They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."""
L302590	u1475	m100	JOE	Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
L302589	u1469	m100	AL	I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
L302588	u1475	m100	JOE	They could put you back in the tube..
L302586	u1469	m100	AL	I don't know. I don't want to find out.
L302585	u1475	m100	JOE	JOE Or what?
L302580	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L302579	u1469	m100	AL	It can't take that long.
L302558	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
L302557	u1469	m100	AL	Did you hear that?
L302537	u1469	m100	AL	No. Don't tell the guards.
L302536	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know...To get Al.
L302529	u1475	m100	JOE	How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
L302528	u1469	m100	AL	Calm Down! Act rational.
L302527	u1469	m100	AL	You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
L302526	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
L302525	u1475	m100	JOE	Why? AL  You know too much.
L302524	u1469	m100	AL	Too late...They want you.
L302523	u1475	m100	JOE	I want out.
L302516	u1475	m100	JOE	Can't see a Goddamn thi..
L302515	u1469	m100	AL	Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
L302514	u1469	m100	AL	Then what are you stopping for?
L302513	u1475	m100	JOE	I wouldn't say that.
L302511	u1469	m100	AL	Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
L302510	u1475	m100	JOE	Now what?
L302509	u1475	m100	JOE	This is a Fiesta!
L302508	u1469	m100	AL	Outrun them.
L302507	u1475	m100	JOE	What do I do?
L302504	u1475	m100	JOE	He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
L302503	u1469	m100	AL	What'd he look like?
L302502	u1475	m100	JOE	Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
L302501	u1469	m100	AL	What's that?
L302500	u1475	m100	JOE	Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
L302499	u1469	m100	AL	Behind us?
L302498	u1475	m100	JOE	No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
L302497	u1469	m100	AL	Anyone there?
L302495	u1469	m100	AL	If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
L302494	u1475	m100	JOE	If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
L302493	u1469	m100	AL	I'll tell you what to say.
L302492	u1475	m100	JOE	Oh...Gooood!
L302491	u1469	m100	AL	I'll talk to them.
L302490	u1475	m100	JOE	Why not?
L302489	u1469	m100	AL	No they won't.
L302488	u1469	m100	AL	Why don't you?
L302487	u1475	m100	JOE	Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
L302486	u1469	m100	AL	You weren't listening!
L302485	u1475	m100	JOE	Who was that? Somebody out there?
L302484	u1469	m100	AL	What was that?
L302479	u1469	m100	AL	Yeah.
L302478	u1475	m100	JOE	With a man in my head...
L302477	u1469	m100	AL	You'll be alive.
L302476	u1469	m100	AL	Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
L302475	u1475	m100	JOE	Why he's argumentative?
L302474	u1469	m100	AL	Yeah.
L302473	u1469	m100	AL	Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
L302472	u1475	m100	JOE	You're gonna explain.
L302471	u1469	m100	AL	You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
L302470	u1475	m100	JOE	Then I'm crazy.
L302469	u1469	m100	AL	Of course you do!
L302468	u1475	m100	JOE	Hear voices don't I.
L302467	u1469	m100	AL	You're not crazy.
L302466	u1475	m100	JOE	Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
L302465	u1469	m100	AL	Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
L302464	u1475	m100	JOE	Yep.
L302463	u1469	m100	AL	Are you crazy?
L302462	u1475	m100	JOE	Kill myself.
L302461	u1469	m100	AL	What for?
L302460	u1475	m100	JOE	Loading a gun.
L302459	u1469	m100	AL	What are you doing?
L302458	u1475	m100	JOE	You said it.
L302457	u1469	m100	AL	I know...it sounds insane.
L302455	u1469	m100	AL	Then how'd I get here?
L302454	u1475	m100	JOE	I just went there for a job.
L302453	u1469	m100	AL	You've heard of U.S.T.?
L302452	u1475	m100	JOE	No.
L302451	u1469	m100	AL	The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
L302450	u1475	m100	JOE	I don't know what you're talking about.
L302449	u1469	m100	AL	Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
L302448	u1475	m100	JOE	Me? What'd I do?
L302447	u1469	m100	AL	Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
L302446	u1469	m100	AL	I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
L302445	u1475	m100	JOE	Are you threatening me?
L302443	u1475	m100	JOE	That a new Datsun?
L302442	u1469	m100	AL	You've heard of the PEM114...
L302440	u1475	m100	JOE	What are you doing in my head, Al?
L302439	u1469	m100	AL	I told you, my name is Al.
L302438	u1475	m100	JOE	It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
L302437	u1469	m100	AL	Quit screwing around, this is important.
L302436	u1475	m100	JOE	Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
L302435	u1469	m100	AL	Yeah...Who?
L302434	u1475	m100	JOE	Who am I?
L302433	u1469	m100	AL	Who are you?
L302430	u1475	m100	JOE	Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
L302429	u1469	m100	AL	I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
L302428	u1475	m100	JOE	Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
L302427	u1469	m100	AL	Right.
L302426	u1475	m100	JOE	You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
L302425	u1469	m100	AL	No.
L302424	u1475	m100	JOE	My place, can't you see?
L302423	u1469	m100	AL	Where are we now?

L303098	u1469	m100	AL	I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
L302703	u1469	m100	AL	Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
L302702	u1477	m100	OUTSIDE -	JOE What abilities...?
L302697	u1469	m100	AL	It's all we've got.

L303354	u1475	m100	JOE	If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
L303351	u1475	m100	JOE	Where would you go to sell a chip?
L303350	u1479	m100	RENE	Where what?
L303346	u1479	m100	RENE	Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
L303345	u1475	m100	JOE	Get us one.
L303344	u1479	m100	RENE	That must be him. Water taxi.
L303337	u1475	m100	JOE	Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
L303336	u1479	m100	RENE	How?
L303335	u1475	m100	JOE	We figure out if it's in here.
L303334	u1479	m100	RENE	Now what?
L303322	u1475	m100	JOE	He plays it all the time.
L303321	u1479	m100	RENE	What?
L303316	u1479	m100	RENE	Then where's the chip.
L303315	u1475	m100	JOE	Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
L303314	u1479	m100	RENE	This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
L303313	u1475	m100	JOE	Beats me.
L303312	u1479	m100	RENE	Where we going?
L303308	u1479	m100	RENE	It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
L303307	u1475	m100	JOE	And you?
L303306	u1479	m100	RENE	Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
L303305	u1475	m100	JOE	And Dieter.
L303304	u1479	m100	RENE	Ryuji and Gruner.
L303303	u1475	m100	JOE	Who was?
L303302	u1479	m100	RENE	They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
L303301	u1475	m100	JOE	What's Gruner like?
L303300	u1475	m100	JOE	You think I'm like that?
L303299	u1479	m100	RENE	Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
L303298	u1475	m100	JOE	Then why are you smiling like that?
L303297	u1479	m100	RENE	Oh sure.
L303296	u1475	m100	JOE	You don't believe me.
L303291	u1475	m100	JOE	Get your things.
L303290	u1479	m100	RENE	Hiroshima.
L303289	u1475	m100	JOE	What is it?
L303288	u1479	m100	RENE	I don't know. He mentioned a city.
L303286	u1475	m100	JOE	Got to trust someone.
L303285	u1479	m100	RENE	How do you know you can trust me?
L303284	u1475	m100	JOE	The most important one. Can you help me find him?
L303283	u1479	m100	RENE	One chip?
L303282	u1475	m100	JOE	A chip. Goes in a computer.
L303281	u1479	m100	RENE	What'd he steal?
L303280	u1475	m100	JOE	We're very close.
L303279	u1479	m100	RENE	He must be a good friend.
L303278	u1475	m100	JOE	He stole something. From a friend of mine.
L303277	u1479	m100	RENE	What's he done?
L303276	u1475	m100	JOE	You know where he went?
L303270	u1479	m100	RENE	Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
L303269	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm just on vacation.
L303268	u1479	m100	RENE	Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
L303267	u1475	m100	JOE	I'm sorry. What will you do?
L303266	u1479	m100	RENE	This business is over.
L303265	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L303264	u1479	m100	RENE	I'm leaving too.
L303263	u1475	m100	JOE	Food doesn't agree with me.
L303262	u1479	m100	RENE	You're leaving.
L303192	u1475	m100	JOE	This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
L303191	u1479	m100	RENE	I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
L303179	u1479	m100	RENE	You did.
L303178	u1475	m100	JOE	Who did?
L303177	u1479	m100	RENE	No.
L303176	u1475	m100	JOE	He didn't.
L303175	u1479	m100	RENE	No, he didn't do that.
L303174	u1475	m100	JOE	Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
L303173	u1479	m100	RENE	Last night?
L303172	u1475	m100	JOE	Were you working for him last night?
L303171	u1479	m100	RENE	Sometimes. I told you I did.
L303170	u1475	m100	JOE	You work for Ryuji?
L303169	u1479	m100	RENE	I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
L303168	u1475	m100	JOE	Why did they leave?
L303167	u1479	m100	RENE	There's not much to tell.
L303166	u1475	m100	JOE	What did you tell them?
L303165	u1479	m100	RENE	They kidded me a little.
L303164	u1475	m100	JOE	Your friends, did they ask about me?
L303163	u1479	m100	RENE	What do you mean?
L303162	u1475	m100	JOE	Who else is interested in me?
L303161	u1479	m100	RENE	You seemed interesting.
L303160	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L303159	u1479	m100	RENE	Wanted to get to know you.
L303158	u1475	m100	JOE	Why did you stay with me?
L303157	u1475	m100	JOE	Why didn't you tell me?
L303156	u1479	m100	RENE	They left. I had to go with them.
L303155	u1475	m100	JOE	Why did you leave?
L303150	u1475	m100	JOE	Why'd you run off?
L303149	u1479	m100	RENE	Joe! What happened to you?
L303083	u1479	m100	RENE	That depends...
L303082	u1475	m100	JOE	And you, what do you like?
L303081	u1479	m100	RENE	He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
L303080	u1475	m100	JOE	How often they come here?
L303079	u1479	m100	RENE	To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
L303078	u1475	m100	JOE	Hires you for what?
L303077	u1479	m100	RENE	No. Ryuji just hires us.
L303076	u1475	m100	JOE	Is that Ryuji?
L303075	u1479	m100	RENE	Trans Ocean Travel.
L303074	u1475	m100	JOE	No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
L303073	u1479	m100	RENE	Who do you work for?
L303072	u1475	m100	JOE	...Naw. Made that up.
L303071	u1479	m100	RENE	...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
L303070	u1475	m100	JOE	Just Okay...
L303069	u1479	m100	RENE	You're doing...Okay.
L303068	u1475	m100	JOE	And how'm I doing?
L303067	u1479	m100	RENE	You're talking to me.
L303066	u1475	m100	JOE	That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
L303065	u1479	m100	RENE	You did.
L303064	u1475	m100	JOE	If I was with you, I wouldn't
L303063	u1479	m100	RENE	Why do you do it?
L303062	u1475	m100	JOE	But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
L303061	u1479	m100	RENE	You talk to yourself.
L303060	u1475	m100	JOE	I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
L303059	u1479	m100	RENE	That you're not crazy.
L303058	u1475	m100	JOE	Promise you what?
L303039	u1479	m100	RENE	Are you alright?
L303038	u1475	m100	JOE	You are.
L303037	u1479	m100	RENE	Can I help?
L303036	u1475	m100	JOE	I am sort of scattered.
L303035	u1479	m100	RENE	As if your mind's not all there.
L303034	u1475	m100	JOE	Disinterest?
L303033	u1479	m100	RENE	...and sort of...disinterest.
L303032	u1475	m100	JOE	It's not apparent.
L303031	u1479	m100	RENE	I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
L303029	u1479	m100	RENE	...I...don't know.
L303028	u1475	m100	JOE	Why?
L303027	u1479	m100	RENE	I waited for you.
L303026	u1475	m100	JOE	Me still. They left you alone?
L303025	u1479	m100	RENE	You again.
L303004	u1479	m100	RENE	I just work for the travel firm.
L303003	u1475	m100	JOE	And you?
L302993	u1475	m100	JOE	Yes, of course.
L302992	u1479	m100	RENE	You mean from it.
L302860	u1479	m100	RENE	...Rene.
L302859	u1475	m100	JOE	Wait. What's your name?
L302856	u1479	m100	RENE	Like there's someone else here.
L302855	u1475	m100	JOE	What way?
L302854	u1479	m100	RENE	Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
L302853	u1475	m100	JOE	What's so funny?
L302843	u1479	m100	RENE	Without what?
L302842	u1475	m100	JOE	Let you leave without it.
L302841	u1479	m100	RENE	Do what?
L302840	u1475	m100	JOE	I can't do that?
L302832	u1479	m100	RENE	Haven't seen you around.
L302831	u1475	m100	JOE	...right here too.
L302830	u1479	m100	RENE	And you.
L302824	u1479	m100	RENE	Oh...I can't. Business.
L302823	u1475	m100	JOE	Dinner...tonight.
L302822	u1479	m100	RENE	Where?
L302821	u1475	m100	JOE	I'll be right there.
L302815	u1475	m100	JOE	Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
L302814	u1479	m100	RENE	Blake said that?
L302811	u1479	m100	RENE	Yes?
L302810	u1475	m100	JOE	The poet...something he said...
L302809	u1479	m100	RENE	Blake?
L302808	u1475	m100	JOE	...Blake
L302806	u1479	m100	RENE	I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
L302805	u1475	m100	JOE	No. No one to speak of.
L302804	u1479	m100	RENE	Is someone else here?
L302799	u1475	m100	JOE	...I'm looking for someone.
L302798	u1479	m100	RENE	What do you do about what?
L303260	u1480	m100	RYUJI	I don't know.
L303259	u1475	m100	JOE	What about the others.
L303258	u1480	m100	RYUJI	Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
L303257	u1475	m100	JOE	Why'd you invite me here?
L303256	u1480	m100	RYUJI	We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
L303255	u1475	m100	JOE	Why are you on to him?
L303254	u1480	m100	RYUJI	I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
L303201	u1475	m100	JOE	Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
L303200	u1480	m100	RYUJI	Excuse me?
L303011	u1475	m100	JOE	...Piece of mind.
L303010	u1480	m100	RYUJI	What could you find in this place?
L302989	u1475	m100	JOE	It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
L302988	u1480	m100	RYUJI	Must be a fulfilling occupation.
L302188	u1475	m100	JOE	Thanks.
L302187	u1478	m100	RECEPTIONIST.	Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
L302186	u1475	m100	JOE	A drink...

L302184	u1478	m100	RECEPTIONIST.	...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
L302183	u1475	m100	JOE	I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
L302182	u1478	m100	RECEPTIONIST.	I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.

L302211	u1476	m100	LEADER	That's alright. Just tear it apart.
L302210	u1482	m100	TECH 3	I can't get it out. It would take hours.
L302209	u1476	m100	LEADER	Could I have it, please.
L302208	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Just one. The back up.
L302207	u1476	m100	LEADER	It will be fine. You have another.
L302206	u1482	m100	TECH 3	It is?
L302205	u1476	m100	LEADER	It's alright.
L302204	u1482	m100	TECH 3	The experiment. The danger...
L302203	u1476	m100	LEADER	Why not?
L302202	u1482	m100	TECH 3	You can't take that.
L302201	u1476	m100	LEADER	Why?
L302200	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Wait.
L302228	u1481	m100	TECH 2	No?
L302227	u1476	m100	LEADER	It doesn't hurt.
L302226	u1481	m100	TECH 2	It will.

L302198	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Right there.
L302574	u1482	m100	TECH 3	What about Al...
L302573	u1481	m100	TECH 2	So we better get started.
L302572	u1482	m100	TECH 3	It'l take months.
L302564	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Whoever took it does.
L302563	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Look, nobody knows we did it.
L302561	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Too much.
L302560	u1482	m100	TECH 3	What does he know?
L302559	u1481	m100	TECH 2	What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
L302258	u1481	m100	TECH 2	Poor bastard.
L302257	u1482	m100	TECH 3	Screw the PEM...What about Al...
L338835	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338834	u1715	m113	LYSSA	That's a better one.
L338820	u1715	m113	LYSSA	That way. I can feel the cold.
L338819	u1712	m113	COLWYN	In the Arctic ice.
L338791	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
L338790	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ...
L338787	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I knew you would come.
L338786	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
L338785	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Yes.
L338782	u1715	m113	LYSSA	All directions are the same here.
L338781	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Take the western passage.
L338778	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
L338777	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't know how.
L338776	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Will your power outward.
L338772	u1715	m113	LYSSA	All the passages are guarded.
L338771	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You must move away from the Center.
L338770	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn ...
L338385	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
L338384	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
L338383	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I know it.
L338382	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will find you. I will be with you.
L338381	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
L338380	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Where is the Fortress?
L338379	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn ...
L338378	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ...
L338281	u1715	m113	LYSSA	In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
L338280	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
L338278	u1715	m113	LYSSA	No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
L338277	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Have they harmed you?
L338276	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn.
L338275	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
L338216	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I can't wait either.
L338215	u1715	m113	LYSSA	About what?
L338214	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I lied.
L338213	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I can't.
L338212	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Thank you, but I can wait.
L338211	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
L338210	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
L338209	u1715	m113	LYSSA	There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
L338204	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Never mind my ears! Go away!
L338203	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
L338188	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
L338187	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We're not married <u>yet</u>.
L338186	u1715	m113	LYSSA	We're almost married.
L338185	u1712	m113	COLWYN	<u>What</u>?
L338184	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
L338183	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I have no intention of getting used to it.
L338182	u1712	m113	COLWYN	If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
L338181	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
L338180	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Well, you're beautiful.
L338179	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
L338178	u1712	m113	COLWYN	That's worse.
L338177	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
L338176	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
L338175	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Me too.
L338174	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
L338173	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
L338172	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't have to go through with it either.
L338171	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
L338236	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
L338235	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
L338234	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
L338233	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I won't leave you here.
L338232	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will go alone.
L338230	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
L338229	u1712	m113	COLWYN	They have Lyssa!
L338219	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Of course it was.
L338218	u1712	m113	COLWYN	It was a platonic kiss, Father.
L338217	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
L338804	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I forbid you!
L338803	u1725	m113	YNYR	I can. Because I choose it.
L338802	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No! You cannot know that!
L338801	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
L338800	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You're coming with us.
L338799	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
L338798	u1725	m113	YNYR	Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
L338797	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
L338796	u1725	m113	YNYR	Use your sword.
L338795	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She can see the Beast!
L338794	u1725	m113	YNYR	I chose the wrong passage.
L338793	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
L338784	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Where the spiral begins.
L338783	u1725	m113	YNYR	The spiral begins in the west.
L338774	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
L338773	u1725	m113	YNYR	She must make a glaive.
L338768	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
L338767	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The Beast will kill her.
L338766	u1725	m113	YNYR	They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
L338721	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Let us wish him peace.
L338720	u1725	m113	YNYR	He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
L338560	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
L338559	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You will tell me her name and we will go together.
L338558	u1725	m113	YNYR	From here, I must go alone.
L338551	u1725	m113	YNYR	He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
L338550	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
L338548	u1725	m113	YNYR	He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
L338547	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
L338525	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.
L338524	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
L338523	u1725	m113	YNYR	You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
L338522	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Never.
L338521	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. She must agree of her own free will.
L338520	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Can she be forced?
L338519	u1725	m113	YNYR	Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
L338518	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
L338517	u1725	m113	YNYR	He has come for Lyssa.
L338516	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338515	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
L338514	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
L338458	u1725	m113	YNYR	You will know, in good time.
L338457	u1712	m113	COLWYN	But you suspect.
L338456	u1725	m113	YNYR	I'm not sure.
L338455	u1712	m113	COLWYN	<u>Why</u>?
L338454	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
L338453	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
L338450	u1725	m113	YNYR	She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
L338449	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot reach her.
L338390	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will find her!
L338389	u1725	m113	YNYR	The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
L338388	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
L338387	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
L338386	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
L338377	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
L338376	u1725	m113	YNYR	What do you see?
L338375	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I can't reach her.
L338367	u1725	m113	YNYR	Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
L338366	u1712	m113	COLWYN	They know when they're going to die?
L338325	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
L338324	u1725	m113	YNYR	You choose these?
L338294	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
L338293	u1725	m113	YNYR	You have not slept in two days.
L338292	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
L338291	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
L338290	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
L338289	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
L338288	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The Fortress moves?
L338287	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
L338286	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
L338285	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
L338274	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
L338273	u1725	m113	YNYR	Reach out farther. Call to her.
L338272	u1712	m113	COLWYN	There is nothing.
L338269	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You won't have to.
L338268	u1725	m113	YNYR	I am too old to climb down a rope.
L338267	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have rope?
L338266	u1725	m113	YNYR	But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
L338264	u1712	m113	COLWYN	But there is another entrance to this place.
L338263	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is no other way.
L338262	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
L338261	u1725	m113	YNYR	With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
L338259	u1712	m113	COLWYN	In the old books. It's called a glaive.
L338258	u1725	m113	YNYR	Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
L338257	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I have no extraordinary powers.
L338256	u1725	m113	YNYR	This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
L338254	u1725	m113	YNYR	I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
L338253	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
L338252	u1725	m113	YNYR	Turold's son was to marry her.
L338251	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The new Queen lives.
L338250	u1725	m113	YNYR	Does the Queen live?
L338249	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The White Castle has fallen.
L338719	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Each to his fate.
L338718	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Each to his fate.
L338714	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Yes. It is today.
L338713	u1712	m113	COLWYN	It is today?
L338705	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Saddles.
L338704	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I road them often in my youth.
L338703	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have done it?
L338702	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	They can be saddled.
L338542	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What will happen?
L338541	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Do not let the waters touch you.
L338537	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	We must enter the swamp.
L338536	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Slayers!
L338501	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
L338500	u1712	m113	COLWYN	How did you know?
L338689	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot.
L338688	u1722	m113	VELLA	You will not, then?
L338687	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
L338686	u1722	m113	VELLA	One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
L338685	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot betray my bride.
L338684	u1722	m113	VELLA	Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
L338683	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot take comfort when she has none.
L338682	u1722	m113	VELLA	Let me comfort you.
L338681	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I ache with it.
L338680	u1722	m113	VELLA	You too are lonely.
L338668	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338667	u1722	m113	VELLA	Even by you?
L338666	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338665	u1722	m113	VELLA	Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
L338664	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338663	u1722	m113	VELLA	Am I not worth returning to?
L338662	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't think that.
L338661	u1722	m113	VELLA	Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
L338660	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I know the cruelty of such a fate.
L338576	u1714	m113	ERGO	What else is left for a man without friends.
L338575	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You and I will guard the fire.
L338574	u1714	m113	ERGO	Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
L338411	u1714	m113	ERGO	<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
L338410	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
L338408	u1714	m113	ERGO	No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
L338407	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I have need of friends.
L338406	u1714	m113	ERGO	My <u>friend</u>.
L338405	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I was hoping I might be your friend.
L338404	u1714	m113	ERGO	Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
L338371	u1712	m113	COLWYN	He saved our lives.
L338370	u1714	m113	ERGO	Once is enough, thank you.
L338309	u1714	m113	ERGO	Staying alive.
L338308	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What business?
L338307	u1714	m113	ERGO	I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
L338302	u1714	m113	ERGO	For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
L338301	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Perhaps he expected to eat it.
L338300	u1714	m113	ERGO	Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
L338299	u1712	m113	COLWYN	A forest near the Valley of Needles.
L338298	u1714	m113	ERGO	It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
L338297	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
L338296	u1714	m113	ERGO	Help! Help! I'm drowning!
L338824	u1712	m113	COLWYN	There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
L338823	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
L338822	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
L338744	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Perhaps. If the pay is good.
L338743	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
L338742	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
L338741	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Naturally.
L338740	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Subject to the King, no doubt.
L338739	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
L338723	u1712	m113	COLWYN	At the gallop!
L338722	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
L338701	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
L338700	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We could reach it on fire-mares.
L338573	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Yes, my lord.
L338572	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Go. I command you.
L338571	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
L338570	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
L338569	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	What kind of friend do you think I am?
L338568	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Go, join them.
L338557	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
L338556	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
L338484	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	A flicker of talent.
L338483	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Hand over your dinner.
L338482	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
L338481	u1712	m113	COLWYN	These we'll pay for.
L338480	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
L338479	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We must try to get horses.
L338478	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You've eaten nothing.
L338416	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
L338415	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Well, I'm not impressed.
L338394	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
L338393	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
L338352	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No.
L338351	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Not sleepy, either?
L338350	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I'm not hungry.
L338347	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
L338346	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
L338345	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I'm all right.
L338344	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	When did you last sleep, boy?
L338334	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
L338333	u1712	m113	COLWYN	That I promise you.
L338332	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	It should be an interesting journey, then.
L338331	u1712	m113	COLWYN	To the place where Death lives.
L338330	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	And where do you lead, boy?
L338329	u1712	m113	COLWYN	So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
L338328	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
L338327	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You will follow me.
L338326	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
L338323	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I know you.
L338322	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Hah! You don't know me, boy.
L338321	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
L338320	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	How did you know I had sons?
L338319	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Fame is what you leave to your sons.
L338318	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
L338317	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Fame.
L338316	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
L338315	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't think you'll grow careless.
L338716	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	And mine goes with you.
L338715	u1714	m113	ERGO	My heart stays here.
L338712	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I cannot go with you, my friend.
L338711	u1714	m113	ERGO	Quell?
L338632	u1714	m113	ERGO	And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
L338631	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	A small house.
L338630	u1714	m113	ERGO	A venison pie as big as a house.
L338566	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	No.
L338565	u1714	m113	ERGO	Can't I come, too?
L338564	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	We'll meet you at the inn.
L338563	u1714	m113	ERGO	Where are you going?
L338535	u1714	m113	ERGO	I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
L338534	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
L338533	u1714	m113	ERGO	What is that awful looking place?
L338467	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I am Quell.
L338466	u1714	m113	ERGO	Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
L338465	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
L338464	u1714	m113	ERGO	You!
L338463	u1714	m113	ERGO	A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
L338462	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Would you settle for a boar?
L338461	u1714	m113	ERGO	Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
L338758	u1714	m113	ERGO	No, no. I'm with you, boy.
L338757	u1719	m113	TITCH	Would you desert your friends?
L338756	u1714	m113	ERGO	Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
L338634	u1714	m113	ERGO	And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
L338633	u1719	m113	TITCH	We meant only to please you.
L338629	u1719	m113	TITCH	It's right behind you.
L338628	u1714	m113	ERGO	Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
L338627	u1719	m113	TITCH	I don't think it's working.
L338626	u1714	m113	ERGO	What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
L338625	u1714	m113	ERGO	First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
L338624	u1719	m113	TITCH	Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
L338490	u1714	m113	ERGO	A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
L338489	u1719	m113	TITCH	I only want one.
L338488	u1714	m113	ERGO	One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
L338487	u1719	m113	TITCH	I'd wish for a puppy.
L338486	u1714	m113	ERGO	If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
L338469	u1714	m113	ERGO	Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
L338468	u1719	m113	TITCH	I'm hungry.
L338448	u1719	m113	TITCH	I ...  ... am Titch.
L338447	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
L338446	u1719	m113	TITCH	You can have half.
L338445	u1714	m113	ERGO	You do?
L338444	u1719	m113	TITCH	I have a cinnamon bar.
L338443	u1714	m113	ERGO	What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
L338442	u1719	m113	TITCH	No.
L338441	u1714	m113	ERGO	Sugarballs?
L338440	u1719	m113	TITCH	No.
L338439	u1714	m113	ERGO	Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
L338637	u1714	m113	ERGO	No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
L338636	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Look at its insides.
L338635	u1714	m113	ERGO	Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
L338554	u1714	m113	ERGO	Hush!
L338553	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I can't hold the weight of both of you!
L338477	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
L338476	u1714	m113	ERGO	The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
L338475	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Passable, pimple, very passable.
L338374	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Oh, my poor stomach.
L338373	u1714	m113	ERGO	Oh, my poor stew!
L338361	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
L338360	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am being exploited! Where are you going?
L338359	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
L338358	u1714	m113	ERGO	Food for crows.
L338357	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We have plenty of hares.
L338356	u1714	m113	ERGO	And do you think I live on air?
L338355	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
L338354	u1714	m113	ERGO	What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
L338342	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
L338341	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You had better manners as a pig.
L338340	u1714	m113	ERGO	Put me down, you lout!
L338312	u1714	m113	ERGO	Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
L338311	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
L338710	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. He will master the leader.
L338709	u1714	m113	ERGO	They'll trample him to death!
L338403	u1714	m113	ERGO	Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
L338402	u1725	m113	YNYR	He is the King.
L338401	u1714	m113	ERGO	And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
L338400	u1725	m113	YNYR	He didn't join them. They joined him.
L338365	u1725	m113	YNYR	If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
L338364	u1714	m113	ERGO	He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
L338363	u1725	m113	YNYR	The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
L338362	u1714	m113	ERGO	One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
L338306	u1714	m113	ERGO	<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
L338305	u1725	m113	YNYR	The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
L338304	u1714	m113	ERGO	My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
L338697	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	He will not come. You will be my queen.
L338696	u1715	m113	LYSSA	He will come for me.
L338679	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then he will die!
L338678	u1715	m113	LYSSA	He will not!
L338677	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
L338676	u1715	m113	LYSSA	It's a lie!
L338675	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then look!
L338674	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
L338653	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
L338652	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I do not want your power. It is hideous.
L338208	u1716	m113	QUEEN	They will have the life that you and I might have had.
L338207	u1721	m113	TUROLD	A fine match.
L338206	u1716	m113	QUEEN	A match for your son, I think.
L338205	u1721	m113	TUROLD	A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
L338200	u1721	m113	TUROLD	That I am, my lady.
L338199	u1716	m113	QUEEN	You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
L338198	u1721	m113	TUROLD	I knew.
L338197	u1716	m113	QUEEN	I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
L338196	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Yes.
L338195	u1721	m113	TUROLD	It is important to assure the succession.
L338194	u1716	m113	QUEEN	For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
L338191	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
L338190	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
L338166	u1721	m113	TUROLD	We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
L338165	u1716	m113	QUEEN	It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
L338164	u1721	m113	TUROLD	The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
L338163	u1716	m113	QUEEN	It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
L338162	u1721	m113	TUROLD	It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
L338161	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Freylag's stronghold?
L338160	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
L338159	u1716	m113	QUEEN	What news from our friends?
L338193	u1721	m113	TUROLD	He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
L338192	u1717	m113	ROWAN	Modred! Impossible!
L338151	u1721	m113	TUROLD	We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
L338150	u1717	m113	ROWAN	Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
L338149	u1721	m113	TUROLD	How many did you lose?
L338148	u1717	m113	ROWAN	I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
L338147	u1717	m113	ROWAN	You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
L338146	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Yes. We lost five.
L338145	u1717	m113	ROWAN	You were attacked in the forest?
L338438	u1718	m113	SEER	They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
L338437	u1725	m113	YNYR	The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
L338429	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
L338428	u1718	m113	SEER	Can you see?
L338427	u1718	m113	SEER	I will seek the Fortress for you.
L338426	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is the time.
L338425	u1718	m113	SEER	Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
L338424	u1725	m113	YNYR	You know the voice.
L338423	u1718	m113	SEER	With an old voice?
L338422	u1725	m113	YNYR	The new King.
L338421	u1718	m113	SEER	Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
L338420	u1725	m113	YNYR	We seek the Fortress of Krull.
L338808	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	That is true.
L338807	u1725	m113	YNYR	Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
L338764	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is too late. He has drunk.
L338763	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Kegan!
L338736	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
L338735	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Look.
L338734	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is not necessary. They will not follow.
L338733	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
L338699	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	It's a hundred leagues from here.
L338698	u1725	m113	YNYR	We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
L338562	u1725	m113	YNYR	Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
L338561	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Each to his fate, lad.
L338539	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Fewer will survive them.
L338538	u1725	m113	YNYR	Few have survived it.
L338513	u1725	m113	YNYR	She had another name once.
L338512	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Her name is Death.
L338511	u1725	m113	YNYR	Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
L338510	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	She has the power to kill.
L338509	u1725	m113	YNYR	She has the power of vision.
L338508	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
L338507	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.
L338506	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	The Widow of the Web?
L338505	u1725	m113	YNYR	I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
L338452	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
L338451	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	The leader of the Dark Ones?
L338397	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
L338396	u1725	m113	YNYR	Many have perished in that maze.
L338395	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
L338392	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
L338391	u1725	m113	YNYR	We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
L338369	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
L338368	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Knowledge I wouldn't want.
L338622	u1724	m113	WIDOW	There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
L338621	u1725	m113	YNYR	You will come with me.
L338620	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
L338619	u1725	m113	YNYR	I cannot stop the sand.
L338616	u1725	m113	YNYR	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
L338615	u1724	m113	WIDOW	It will not help.
L338614	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
L338613	u1725	m113	YNYR	A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
L338612	u1724	m113	WIDOW	No.
L338611	u1725	m113	YNYR	Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
L338610	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You lie!
L338609	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
L338608	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Why must you know?
L338607	u1725	m113	YNYR	The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
L338606	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Of what?
L338605	u1725	m113	YNYR	Knowledge.
L338604	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
L338603	u1725	m113	YNYR	Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
L338602	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Yes.
L338601	u1725	m113	YNYR	You see?
L338600	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
L338599	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is no trickery.
L338598	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Do not try your trickery on me!
L338597	u1724	m113	WIDOW	I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
L338596	u1725	m113	YNYR	Where is he? My son.
L338595	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
L338594	u1725	m113	YNYR	You said nothing. You told me nothing.
L338593	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You had a son.
L338592	u1725	m113	YNYR	We had no children.
L338591	u1724	m113	WIDOW	She bore you many children?
L338590	u1725	m113	YNYR	No, she was not as beautiful.
L338589	u1724	m113	WIDOW	She was not as beautiful.
L338588	u1725	m113	YNYR	Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
L338587	u1724	m113	WIDOW	But you would not stay with me.
L338586	u1725	m113	YNYR	The most beautiful woman in the world.
L338585	u1724	m113	WIDOW	I was beautiful then.
L338584	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
L338583	u1724	m113	WIDOW	It is fifty years since I heard that name.
L338582	u1725	m113	YNYR	Ynyr!
L338581	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Who speaks that name!
L346420	u1782	m118	BARON	Purely a precaution...
L346419	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Fire moat... why do that?
L346418	u1782	m118	BARON	Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
L346417	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	We come watch... we come watch...
L346412	u1782	m118	BARON	I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
L346411	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	You go?  Not watch fun?
L346408	u1782	m118	BARON	Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
L346407	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Then we smash 'em?
L346406	u1782	m118	BARON	Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
L346385	u1782	m118	BARON	Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
L346384	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Fool's magic.
L346381	u1782	m118	BARON	Faith.
L346380	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Why so few?
L346416	u1782	m118	BARON	To finish last evening's delightful work.
L346415	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	You go to lady now?
L346414	u1782	m118	BARON	This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
L346413	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	More fun win battle?
L346410	u1782	m118	BARON	Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
L346409	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	We watch... good fun...
L346392	u1782	m118	BARON	I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
L346391	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	Birdies... pretty...
L346389	u1782	m118	BARON	No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
L346388	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	We go out, smash 'em now?
L346387	u1782	m118	BARON	Always.
L346386	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
L346383	u1782	m118	BARON	Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
L346382	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	What?
L346490	u1782	m118	BARON	So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
L346489	u1788	m118	LILI	To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
L346488	u1782	m118	BARON	Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
L346487	u1788	m118	LILI	Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
L346486	u1782	m118	BARON	Or looked so beautiful...
L346485	u1788	m118	LILI	Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
L346484	u1782	m118	BARON	And, now?
L346483	u1788	m118	LILI	It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
L346482	u1782	m118	BARON	Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
L346481	u1788	m118	LILI	And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
L346480	u1782	m118	BARON	Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
L346479	u1788	m118	LILI	Might we watch, too?
L346478	u1782	m118	BARON	From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
L346477	u1788	m118	LILI	It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
L346476	u1782	m118	BARON	It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
L346475	u1788	m118	LILI	What was that?  Did you hear that?
L346350	u1782	m118	BARON	Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
L346349	u1788	m118	LILI	You're a beast!
L346348	u1782	m118	BARON	My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
L346347	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't expect you'd understand.
L346346	u1782	m118	BARON	Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
L346345	u1788	m118	LILI	Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
L346344	u1782	m118	BARON	I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
L346343	u1788	m118	LILI	I see...
L346342	u1782	m118	BARON	When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
L346341	u1788	m118	LILI	What will become of me then?
L346340	u1782	m118	BARON	Yes?
L346339	u1788	m118	LILI	And then?
L346338	u1782	m118	BARON	A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
L346337	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, yes...
L346336	u1782	m118	BARON	We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
L346335	u1782	m118	BARON	At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
L346334	u1788	m118	LILI	What do you want from me?
L346333	u1782	m118	BARON	Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
L346332	u1788	m118	LILI	Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
L346331	u1782	m118	BARON	I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
L346330	u1788	m118	LILI	No more... please...
L346329	u1782	m118	BARON	Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
L346328	u1788	m118	LILI	Kill me... I want... so nice...
L346327	u1782	m118	BARON	Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
L346216	u1782	m118	BARON	Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
L346215	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
L346213	u1782	m118	BARON	No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
L346212	u1788	m118	LILI	Do it now!
L346211	u1782	m118	BARON	When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
L346207	u1782	m118	BARON	We're both of us damned, my beauty.
L346206	u1788	m118	LILI	Damn you!
L346204	u1788	m118	LILI	I'd soon die.
L346203	u1782	m118	BARON	To be my bride, of course.
L346202	u1788	m118	LILI	Why have you brought me here?
L346201	u1782	m118	BARON	I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
L346200	u1788	m118	LILI	Do you feed on mice and rats?
L346199	u1782	m118	BARON	I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
L346198	u1788	m118	LILI	Like some vile toadstool.
L346197	u1782	m118	BARON	I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
L346196	u1788	m118	LILI	Protection?
L346195	u1782	m118	BARON	I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
L346194	u1788	m118	LILI	Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
L346193	u1782	m118	BARON	I am afraid of nothing.
L346192	u1788	m118	LILI	And you... are you not also afraid?
L346191	u1782	m118	BARON	We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
L346190	u1788	m118	LILI	You... you're a beast!
L346189	u1782	m118	BARON	Not from me, surely...
L346188	u1788	m118	LILI	God protect me.
L346187	u1782	m118	BARON	You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
L346186	u1788	m118	LILI	You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
L346185	u1782	m118	BARON	On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
L346184	u1788	m118	LILI	Grotesque... monstrous...
L346183	u1782	m118	BARON	You're magnificent.
L346182	u1788	m118	LILI	But I'm hideous!
L346181	u1782	m118	BARON	I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
L346180	u1788	m118	LILI	You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
L346179	u1782	m118	BARON	I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
L346178	u1788	m118	LILI	Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
L346177	u1782	m118	BARON	Your love.
L346176	u1788	m118	LILI	What do you want with me?
L346175	u1782	m118	BARON	My generosity is not so large as that.
L345926	u1783	m118	DRAGON	No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
L345925	u1785	m118	JACK	No, wait... please... listen...
L345923	u1785	m118	JACK	Oh no... Don't you understand?
L345922	u1783	m118	DRAGON	You come stealee tleasoo?
L345921	u1785	m118	JACK	I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
L345920	u1783	m118	DRAGON	An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
L345919	u1785	m118	JACK	It's terrible.
L345918	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Flozen foleva not good.
L345917	u1785	m118	JACK	Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
L345916	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
L345915	u1785	m118	JACK	You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
L345914	u1783	m118	DRAGON	You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
L345913	u1785	m118	JACK	East of Mercia?
L345912	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
L345911	u1785	m118	JACK	Cathay?
L345910	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
L345909	u1785	m118	JACK	Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
L345908	u1783	m118	DRAGON	No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
L345907	u1785	m118	JACK	Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
L345906	u1783	m118	DRAGON	You come stealee tleasoo?
L345905	u1785	m118	JACK	I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
L345904	u1783	m118	DRAGON	What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
L345903	u1785	m118	JACK	I didn't know... I --
L345902	u1783	m118	DRAGON	What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
L346236	u1789	m118	OGG	There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
L346235	u1784	m118	GUMP	We be honored, friend Ogg.
L346234	u1789	m118	OGG	Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
L346098	u1784	m118	GUMP	Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
L346097	u1789	m118	OGG	Who might these friends be?
L346096	u1784	m118	GUMP	Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
L346095	u1789	m118	OGG	Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
L346094	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
L346093	u1789	m118	OGG	Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
L346092	u1784	m118	GUMP	Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
L346625	u1784	m118	GUMP	You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
L346624	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll try.
L346623	u1784	m118	GUMP	You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
L346622	u1784	m118	GUMP	That's it then... the ring!
L346621	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
L346620	u1784	m118	GUMP	And did you?
L346619	u1785	m118	JACK	She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
L346618	u1784	m118	GUMP	Go on... go on...
L346617	u1785	m118	JACK	By the pond.  She was teasing me.
L346616	u1784	m118	GUMP	Where?
L346615	u1785	m118	JACK	I was with the Princess.
L346614	u1784	m118	GUMP	Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
L346613	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll do anything... face any challenge!
L346612	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
L346611	u1785	m118	JACK	The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
L346607	u1785	m118	JACK	She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
L346606	u1784	m118	GUMP	She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
L346605	u1785	m118	JACK	Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
L346604	u1784	m118	GUMP	Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
L346603	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
L346602	u1784	m118	GUMP	On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
L346601	u1784	m118	GUMP	Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
L346600	u1785	m118	JACK	Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
L346599	u1784	m118	GUMP	I've not heard a note out of you.
L346598	u1785	m118	JACK	A good day for singing...
L346583	u1784	m118	GUMP	You're on your own... like a true champion.
L346582	u1785	m118	JACK	He'll not escape me.
L346581	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ride like wild fire, Jack.
L346575	u1785	m118	JACK	Sapphire!
L346574	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
L346571	u1785	m118	JACK	I could have struck off his head just now!
L346570	u1784	m118	GUMP	Never show mercy!
L346569	u1785	m118	JACK	He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
L346562	u1785	m118	JACK	Hurry up!
L346561	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't get too far!
L346560	u1785	m118	JACK	Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
L346557	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
L346556	u1785	m118	JACK	Can't we move any faster?
L346552	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
L346551	u1785	m118	JACK	Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
L346550	u1784	m118	GUMP	Patience, lad.
L346549	u1785	m118	JACK	Will you explain what's going on?
L346545	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
L346544	u1785	m118	JACK	Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
L346543	u1784	m118	GUMP	Sunlight.
L346542	u1785	m118	JACK	What weapon?
L346541	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
L346540	u1785	m118	JACK	Did you bring me here to sup?
L346539	u1784	m118	GUMP	The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
L346537	u1784	m118	GUMP	I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
L346536	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not afraid of the dark.
L346535	u1784	m118	GUMP	Mean you to seek him out below?
L346534	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
L346533	u1784	m118	GUMP	Sunlight, you say?
L346532	u1785	m118	JACK	Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
L346531	u1784	m118	GUMP	In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
L346530	u1785	m118	JACK	The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
L346529	u1784	m118	GUMP	The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
L346528	u1785	m118	JACK	I don't... understand.
L346527	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
L346526	u1785	m118	JACK	Can you save her?
L346525	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
L346524	u1785	m118	JACK	The wound is mortal.
L346523	u1784	m118	GUMP	She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
L346522	u1785	m118	JACK	... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
L346521	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nonsense!  Course it matters.
L346520	u1785	m118	JACK	It doesn't matter.
L346519	u1784	m118	GUMP	Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
L346465	u1784	m118	GUMP	It's what we'll find there worries me.
L346464	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  We're good as inside.
L346463	u1784	m118	GUMP	Best get down close to the moat, lad.
L346462	u1785	m118	JACK	He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
L346454	u1784	m118	GUMP	Fire away!
L346453	u1785	m118	JACK	Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
L346452	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
L346451	u1785	m118	JACK	Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
L346450	u1784	m118	GUMP	That's it!
L346449	u1785	m118	JACK	One more turn...
L346435	u1785	m118	JACK	There must be some way to get it up there.
L346434	u1784	m118	GUMP	Will you chance a miss?
L346433	u1785	m118	JACK	That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
L346432	u1784	m118	GUMP	Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
L346431	u1785	m118	JACK	What magic have we on our side?
L346430	u1784	m118	GUMP	Been telling you that all along, lad.
L346429	u1785	m118	JACK	There isn't much time!
L346428	u1784	m118	GUMP	And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
L346427	u1785	m118	JACK	Water doesn't burn...
L346404	u1785	m118	JACK	Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
L346403	u1784	m118	GUMP	There aren't enough arrows.
L346402	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
L346401	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easily spoken...
L346400	u1785	m118	JACK	Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
L346399	u1784	m118	GUMP	A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
L346375	u1785	m118	JACK	We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
L346374	u1784	m118	GUMP	Why not mine the damned walls?
L346373	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
L346372	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
L346370	u1784	m118	GUMP	Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
L346369	u1785	m118	JACK	On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
L346368	u1784	m118	GUMP	That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
L346363	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
L346362	u1785	m118	JACK	There's more than one way to spring a trap.
L346361	u1784	m118	GUMP	It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
L346360	u1785	m118	JACK	Give in to despair and all is lost.
L346357	u1785	m118	JACK	It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
L346356	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
L346352	u1785	m118	JACK	The chill is worse this night.
L346351	u1784	m118	GUMP	Never felt so cold in all me born days...
L346324	u1784	m118	GUMP	No... but what choice have we?
L346323	u1785	m118	JACK	Can we trust him?
L346305	u1785	m118	JACK	But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
L346304	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
L346296	u1784	m118	GUMP	I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
L346295	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
L346294	u1784	m118	GUMP	Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
L346290	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  This time we strike first!
L346289	u1784	m118	GUMP	Wait, Jack.
L346287	u1784	m118	GUMP	Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
L346286	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll never find the Baron's castle.
L346285	u1784	m118	GUMP	Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
L346284	u1785	m118	JACK	Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
L346275	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
L346274	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll trust in faith, Gump.
L346273	u1784	m118	GUMP	Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
L346272	u1785	m118	JACK	Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
L346271	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
L346270	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll find it.
L346269	u1784	m118	GUMP	We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
L346268	u1785	m118	JACK	No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
L346267	u1784	m118	GUMP	Is she... dead?
L346262	u1784	m118	GUMP	Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
L346261	u1785	m118	JACK	Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
L346256	u1784	m118	GUMP	Willful creature, that one...
L346255	u1785	m118	JACK	Wait!
L346249	u1785	m118	JACK	It bodes evil.
L346248	u1784	m118	GUMP	What make ye of that, Jack?
L346247	u1785	m118	JACK	There's the way, mates.
L346246	u1784	m118	GUMP	God's blessing.
L346244	u1784	m118	GUMP	Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
L346243	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
L346242	u1784	m118	GUMP	... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
L346230	u1784	m118	GUMP	Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
L346229	u1785	m118	JACK	Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
L346140	u1784	m118	GUMP	Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
L346139	u1785	m118	JACK	God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
L346138	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
L346137	u1785	m118	JACK	We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
L346136	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
L346134	u1784	m118	GUMP	Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
L346133	u1785	m118	JACK	I pray always to be worthy of it.
L346116	u1785	m118	JACK	Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
L346115	u1784	m118	GUMP	I should hope not!
L346112	u1784	m118	GUMP	Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
L346111	u1785	m118	JACK	Certainly understandable.
L346110	u1784	m118	GUMP	Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
L346109	u1784	m118	GUMP	Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
L346108	u1785	m118	JACK	Ogg's footprints!
L346107	u1784	m118	GUMP	Something the matter?
L346106	u1785	m118	JACK	My God!  Look!
L346089	u1784	m118	GUMP	Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
L346088	u1785	m118	JACK	Nice piece of work.
L346083	u1785	m118	JACK	Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
L346082	u1784	m118	GUMP	Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
L346081	u1785	m118	JACK	Better to kill than be disturbed.
L346080	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
L346079	u1785	m118	JACK	And this?  Some of their handiwork?
L346078	u1784	m118	GUMP	Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
L346077	u1785	m118	JACK	I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
L346076	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
L346075	u1785	m118	JACK	Twould appear other travelers precede us.
L346074	u1784	m118	GUMP	Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
L346073	u1785	m118	JACK	Good.
L346070	u1784	m118	GUMP	That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
L346069	u1785	m118	JACK	Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
L346065	u1785	m118	JACK	Stealing his arms?
L346064	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
L346063	u1785	m118	JACK	There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
L346062	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
L346061	u1785	m118	JACK	What know you of fields of war?
L346060	u1784	m118	GUMP	Worse than the battlefield.
L346056	u1784	m118	GUMP	Jack, don't!
L346055	u1785	m118	JACK	The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
L346054	u1784	m118	GUMP	Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
L346053	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
L346052	u1784	m118	GUMP	Blackheart?
L346051	u1785	m118	JACK	This is ogre's magic.
L346036	u1784	m118	GUMP	Good plan that.
L346035	u1785	m118	JACK	Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
L346034	u1784	m118	GUMP	How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
L346022	u1784	m118	GUMP	Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
L346021	u1785	m118	JACK	Beware.
L346020	u1784	m118	GUMP	Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
L346019	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
L346018	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
L346017	u1785	m118	JACK	"Jenny Greenteeth said:  ""Follow the raven in her flight..."""
L346016	u1784	m118	GUMP	Whatever for?
L346015	u1785	m118	JACK	We must follow that bird.
L346010	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
L346009	u1784	m118	GUMP	Track the demon to his lair.
L346008	u1785	m118	JACK	A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
L346007	u1784	m118	GUMP	How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
L346006	u1785	m118	JACK	We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
L346005	u1784	m118	GUMP	Fine-looking army.
L346004	u1785	m118	JACK	Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
L346003	u1784	m118	GUMP	I'll drop a cow on the knave!
L346002	u1785	m118	JACK	You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
L346001	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye!  That too.
L346000	u1785	m118	JACK	Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
L345999	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
L345998	u1785	m118	JACK	We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
L345997	u1784	m118	GUMP	I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
L345996	u1785	m118	JACK	The colt's still too small.
L345995	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
L345975	u1784	m118	GUMP	Careful, lad.
L345974	u1785	m118	JACK	Damn them!
L345969	u1785	m118	JACK	It would appear so.
L345968	u1784	m118	GUMP	Pregnant, is she?
L345965	u1784	m118	GUMP	Something's coming.
L345964	u1785	m118	JACK	What is it?
L345955	u1784	m118	GUMP	Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
L345954	u1785	m118	JACK	Shhhh!
L345947	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
L345946	u1785	m118	JACK	I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
L345943	u1784	m118	GUMP	No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
L345942	u1785	m118	JACK	By the grace of God.
L345938	u1785	m118	JACK	Better we eat him than the other way round.
L345937	u1784	m118	GUMP	There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
L345898	u1784	m118	GUMP	You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
L345897	u1785	m118	JACK	What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
L345896	u1784	m118	GUMP	There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
L345895	u1785	m118	JACK	You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
L345894	u1784	m118	GUMP	Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
L345893	u1785	m118	JACK	Knaves and robbers...
L345892	u1784	m118	GUMP	Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
L345891	u1785	m118	JACK	So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
L345890	u1784	m118	GUMP	No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
L345889	u1785	m118	JACK	And who might that be?
L345888	u1784	m118	GUMP	A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
L345887	u1785	m118	JACK	Have we turned grave-robber, then?
L345886	u1784	m118	GUMP	There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
L345885	u1784	m118	GUMP	I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
L345884	u1785	m118	JACK	Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
L345883	u1784	m118	GUMP	Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
L345882	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
L345881	u1784	m118	GUMP	Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
L345880	u1785	m118	JACK	If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
L345879	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
L345878	u1785	m118	JACK	Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
L345877	u1784	m118	GUMP	Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
L345876	u1785	m118	JACK	The princess is dead.
L345828	u1784	m118	GUMP	Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
L345827	u1785	m118	JACK	And if she thinks me a liar?
L345826	u1784	m118	GUMP	Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
L345825	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
L345824	u1785	m118	JACK	What do I do?
L345823	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
L345822	u1785	m118	JACK	Are we here?
L345820	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
L345819	u1785	m118	JACK	Will you lead me to her?
L345818	u1784	m118	GUMP	Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
L345817	u1785	m118	JACK	How is it this hag knows the truth?
L345816	u1784	m118	GUMP	Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
L345815	u1785	m118	JACK	Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
L345814	u1784	m118	GUMP	True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
L345813	u1785	m118	JACK	There must be an answer somewhere.
L345812	u1784	m118	GUMP	Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
L345811	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't you care about what's happened?
L345810	u1784	m118	GUMP	If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
L345809	u1785	m118	JACK	Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
L345808	u1784	m118	GUMP	That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
L345806	u1784	m118	GUMP	If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
L345805	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't you know?
L345804	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
L345803	u1785	m118	JACK	Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
L345802	u1784	m118	GUMP	Big question that, lad.  Why what?
L345801	u1785	m118	JACK	But... but, why?
L345799	u1784	m118	GUMP	He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
L345798	u1785	m118	JACK	Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
L345797	u1784	m118	GUMP	Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
L345796	u1785	m118	JACK	Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
L345795	u1784	m118	GUMP	Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
L345794	u1785	m118	JACK	It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
L345793	u1784	m118	GUMP	Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
L345791	u1785	m118	JACK	What does she want from me?
L345790	u1784	m118	GUMP	Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
L345783	u1784	m118	GUMP	Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
L345782	u1785	m118	JACK	I fear she's lost.
L345781	u1784	m118	GUMP	I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
L345780	u1785	m118	JACK	Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
L345779	u1784	m118	GUMP	You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
L345778	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
L345777	u1784	m118	GUMP	You be our guest, Jack.
L345776	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
L345775	u1785	m118	JACK	A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
L345774	u1784	m118	GUMP	Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
L345773	u1785	m118	JACK	The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
L345772	u1784	m118	GUMP	What!
L345771	u1785	m118	JACK	It's bluebells!
L345768	u1784	m118	GUMP	Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
L345767	u1785	m118	JACK	And if I cannot?
L345766	u1784	m118	GUMP	Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
L345765	u1785	m118	JACK	I meant no disrespect.
L345764	u1784	m118	GUMP	You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
L345763	u1785	m118	JACK	No... I... I need to rest.
L345762	u1784	m118	GUMP	And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
L345761	u1785	m118	JACK	Enough!
L345758	u1784	m118	GUMP	Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
L345757	u1785	m118	JACK	No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
L345754	u1784	m118	GUMP	To be sure.
L345753	u1785	m118	JACK	Faerie ring?
L345752	u1784	m118	GUMP	Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
L345751	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm in no mood for dancing.
L345750	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
L345749	u1785	m118	JACK	Gump, is it?
L345748	u1784	m118	GUMP	So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
L346568	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Sorry.
L346567	u1784	m118	GUMP	Dolt!
L346547	u1784	m118	GUMP	They'll do nicely.
L346546	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	How're these?
L346448	u1784	m118	GUMP	Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
L346447	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
L346446	u1784	m118	GUMP	Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
L346441	u1784	m118	GUMP	Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
L346440	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Aye... my Lord...
L346439	u1784	m118	GUMP	You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
L346438	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
L346426	u1784	m118	GUMP	They've fired the moat!
L346425	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Sweet slippers of Oisin!
L346424	u1784	m118	GUMP	Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
L346423	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
L346266	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Three cheers for our champion.
L346265	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well done, lad.
L346104	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Gonna make ogre-stew!
L346103	u1784	m118	GUMP	We seek to undo the curse.
L346072	u1784	m118	GUMP	Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
L346071	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
L346048	u1784	m118	GUMP	These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
L346047	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	You see!  You see!
L346040	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	No, no, no... this is different!
L346039	u1784	m118	GUMP	Barely living, from the looks of it.
L345982	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
L345981	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
L345941	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
L345940	u1784	m118	GUMP	Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
L345939	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
L346655	u1785	m118	JACK	Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
L346654	u1788	m118	LILI	Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
L346653	u1785	m118	JACK	Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
L346652	u1788	m118	LILI	I can't see a thing.
L346651	u1785	m118	JACK	Everywhere!  Ow!
L346650	u1788	m118	LILI	Pinching?  Where?
L346649	u1785	m118	JACK	Pinching me!
L346648	u1788	m118	LILI	Biting you?
L346647	u1785	m118	JACK	Ouch!  Something's biting me.
L346646	u1788	m118	LILI	What's the matter?
L346644	u1788	m118	LILI	And I love you, my husband.
L346643	u1785	m118	JACK	Lili... I love you!
L346642	u1788	m118	LILI	You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
L346641	u1785	m118	JACK	But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
L346640	u1788	m118	LILI	Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
L346639	u1785	m118	JACK	You're teasing still.
L346638	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
L346637	u1785	m118	JACK	Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
L346636	u1788	m118	LILI	Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
L346635	u1785	m118	JACK	I can't have been under much more than a minute.
L346634	u1788	m118	LILI	Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
L346633	u1785	m118	JACK	Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
L346632	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
L346518	u1788	m118	LILI	And I... love you...
L346517	u1785	m118	JACK	No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
L346516	u1788	m118	LILI	In the dark... where I join him...
L346515	u1785	m118	JACK	So, he's hiding in the dark...
L346514	u1788	m118	LILI	That's why he goes masked during the day...
L346513	u1785	m118	JACK	Sunlight?
L346512	u1788	m118	LILI	Sunlight... It destroys him.
L346511	u1785	m118	JACK	What?
L346510	u1788	m118	LILI	No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
L346509	u1785	m118	JACK	It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
L346508	u1788	m118	LILI	You've freed me, Jack...
L346507	u1785	m118	JACK	No!  I won't let it happen...
L346505	u1785	m118	JACK	They told me you were dead.
L346504	u1788	m118	LILI	I was bewitched... it's better this way...
L346503	u1785	m118	JACK	I thought you were dead... I --
L346502	u1788	m118	LILI	Only what's right...
L346501	u1785	m118	JACK	What have I done?
L346500	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack... Forgive me...
L346499	u1785	m118	JACK	Lili!  No!
L345741	u1785	m118	JACK	What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
L345740	u1788	m118	LILI	Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
L345739	u1785	m118	JACK	If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
L345738	u1788	m118	LILI	Then, perchance you'll me.
L345737	u1785	m118	JACK	I have no wife.
L345736	u1788	m118	LILI	Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
L345735	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis not fit for a princess.
L345734	u1788	m118	LILI	Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
L345733	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm afraid it may storm.
L345731	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, la...
L345730	u1785	m118	JACK	My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
L345729	u1788	m118	LILI	Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
L345728	u1785	m118	JACK	My lady mocks me.
L345727	u1788	m118	LILI	If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
L345726	u1785	m118	JACK	There's no happier thought under heaven.
L345725	u1788	m118	LILI	A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
L345724	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis the truth.
L345723	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
L345722	u1785	m118	JACK	Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
L345720	u1785	m118	JACK	Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
L345719	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
L345718	u1785	m118	JACK	Its powers are strong.
L345717	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't want it on me.
L345716	u1785	m118	JACK	There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
L345715	u1785	m118	JACK	Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
L345714	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
L345713	u1785	m118	JACK	He did run?
L345712	u1788	m118	LILI	It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
L345711	u1785	m118	JACK	How bad was the unicorn's wound?
L345710	u1788	m118	LILI	My own father...
L345709	u1785	m118	JACK	They tricked you.
L345708	u1788	m118	LILI	I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
L345707	u1785	m118	JACK	Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
L345706	u1788	m118	LILI	My father and the Baron.
L345705	u1785	m118	JACK	Who?
L345704	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
L345703	u1785	m118	JACK	What happened?
L345700	u1785	m118	JACK	To fetch your napkin.
L345699	u1788	m118	LILI	Where are you going?
L345698	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
L345697	u1788	m118	LILI	I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
L345696	u1785	m118	JACK	Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
L345695	u1788	m118	LILI	He'll not flee if I show myself?
L345694	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
L345693	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack!
L345692	u1785	m118	JACK	Are you honest?
L345691	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
L345690	u1785	m118	JACK	They rival the angels of paradise.
L345689	u1788	m118	LILI	Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
L345686	u1785	m118	JACK	In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
L345685	u1788	m118	LILI	I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
L345684	u1785	m118	JACK	Shhh!
L345683	u1788	m118	LILI	How much longer?
L345679	u1785	m118	JACK	Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
L345678	u1788	m118	LILI	The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
L345677	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not its master.
L345676	u1788	m118	LILI	Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
L345675	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll go search for it.
L345674	u1788	m118	LILI	I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
L345673	u1785	m118	JACK	What's the matter?
L345672	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, dear.
L345671	u1785	m118	JACK	Be patient.
L345670	u1788	m118	LILI	What shall we do?
L345669	u1785	m118	JACK	That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
L345668	u1788	m118	LILI	I detest serpents.
L345667	u1785	m118	JACK	Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
L345666	u1788	m118	LILI	A gentleman would offer water.
L345665	u1785	m118	JACK	Stop complaining.
L345664	u1788	m118	LILI	Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
L345663	u1785	m118	JACK	All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
L345662	u1788	m118	LILI	A promise is a sacred oath.
L345661	u1785	m118	JACK	Unicorn?
L345660	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
L345659	u1785	m118	JACK	Blackheart.  Aptly named.
L345658	u1788	m118	LILI	The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
L345657	u1785	m118	JACK	Sport, indeed.
L345656	u1788	m118	LILI	It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
L345655	u1785	m118	JACK	Or perchance...
L345654	u1788	m118	LILI	Liar!
L345653	u1785	m118	JACK	I may have said perhaps...
L345652	u1788	m118	LILI	But you did... you did!
L345651	u1785	m118	JACK	Never.
L345650	u1788	m118	LILI	You promised!
L345648	u1788	m118	LILI	If you like.
L345647	u1785	m118	JACK	These for me?
L345646	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
L345645	u1785	m118	JACK	Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
L346128	u1789	m118	OGG	Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
L346127	u1785	m118	JACK	Sigurd's sword...
L346114	u1785	m118	JACK	His feet shall never cross my lips.
L346113	u1789	m118	OGG	Step lively now!
L346102	u1789	m118	OGG	Thought the weather terrible of late.
L346101	u1785	m118	JACK	We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
L346100	u1789	m118	OGG	Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
L346099	u1785	m118	JACK	Honored to make your acquaintance.
L345875	u1786	m118	JENNY	What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
L345874	u1785	m118	JACK	As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
L345873	u1786	m118	JENNY	You'll visit again?
L345872	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
L345871	u1786	m118	JENNY	Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
L345870	u1785	m118	JACK	This is sad news, be it true.
L345869	u1786	m118	JENNY	Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
L345868	u1785	m118	JACK	I don't believe you.
L345867	u1786	m118	JENNY	Dead, dead, dead.
L345866	u1785	m118	JACK	No!
L345865	u1786	m118	JENNY	She's dead!
L345864	u1785	m118	JACK	Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
L345863	u1786	m118	JENNY	As fair as me?
L345862	u1785	m118	JACK	Exceeding fair.
L345861	u1786	m118	JENNY	Is she fair, this princess?
L345860	u1785	m118	JACK	Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
L345859	u1786	m118	JENNY	Princess?  I know of no princess.
L345858	u1785	m118	JACK	What became of the princess?
L345857	u1786	m118	JENNY	Ask away, sweet man.
L345856	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
L345855	u1786	m118	JENNY	Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
L345854	u1785	m118	JACK	Not very precise directions.
L345853	u1786	m118	JENNY	Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
L345852	u1785	m118	JACK	Where do I find the Baron's castle?
L345851	u1786	m118	JENNY	You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
L345850	u1785	m118	JACK	How do I get the horn back?
L345849	u1786	m118	JENNY	That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
L345848	u1785	m118	JACK	He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
L345847	u1786	m118	JENNY	Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
L345846	u1785	m118	JACK	Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
L345845	u1786	m118	JENNY	Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
L345844	u1785	m118	JACK	A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
L345843	u1785	m118	JACK	Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
L345842	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
L345841	u1786	m118	JENNY	I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
L345840	u1785	m118	JACK	The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
L345839	u1786	m118	JENNY	The moon is too round of face, methinks.
L345838	u1785	m118	JACK	The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
L345837	u1786	m118	JENNY	Think me fair, do you, Jack?
L345836	u1785	m118	JACK	Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
L345835	u1786	m118	JENNY	Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
L345834	u1785	m118	JACK	They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
L345833	u1786	m118	JENNY	Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
L345832	u1785	m118	JACK	I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
L345831	u1786	m118	JENNY	What's this now?
L346252	u1790	m118	OONA	True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
L346251	u1785	m118	JACK	Heading north still?
L346250	u1790	m118	OONA	Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
L346226	u1790	m118	OONA	You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
L346225	u1785	m118	JACK	Be fair, Oona.
L346224	u1790	m118	OONA	I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
L346223	u1785	m118	JACK	And as barren of love as stone.
L346222	u1790	m118	OONA	What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
L346221	u1785	m118	JACK	Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
L346220	u1790	m118	OONA	Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
L346219	u1785	m118	JACK	Please...
L346218	u1790	m118	OONA	You... you... you mortal you!
L346217	u1785	m118	JACK	Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
L346167	u1790	m118	OONA	What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
L346166	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm promised to another!
L346165	u1790	m118	OONA	A faerie's love makes anything possible.
L346164	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
L346163	u1790	m118	OONA	Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
L346162	u1785	m118	JACK	Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
L346161	u1790	m118	OONA	And sweet?
L346160	u1785	m118	JACK	You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
L346159	u1790	m118	OONA	Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
L346158	u1785	m118	JACK	How so?
L346157	u1790	m118	OONA	Jest with me then.
L346156	u1785	m118	JACK	That was in jest.
L346155	u1790	m118	OONA	Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
L346154	u1785	m118	JACK	Wondrously so.
L346153	u1790	m118	OONA	And am I not fair?
L346152	u1785	m118	JACK	In every way.
L346151	u1790	m118	OONA	Do I not please you, Jack?
L346150	u1785	m118	JACK	I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
L346149	u1790	m118	OONA	Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
L346148	u1785	m118	JACK	And charmed, of course.
L346147	u1790	m118	OONA	Only that?
L346146	u1785	m118	JACK	I'd be honored.
L346145	u1790	m118	OONA	I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
L346144	u1785	m118	JACK	I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
L346143	u1790	m118	OONA	Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
L346142	u1785	m118	JACK	Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
L345992	u1785	m118	JACK	No fear of that now.
L345991	u1790	m118	OONA	Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
L345985	u1790	m118	OONA	No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
L345984	u1785	m118	JACK	Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
L345983	u1790	m118	OONA	Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
L345959	u1790	m118	OONA	Sorry.
L345958	u1785	m118	JACK	This is not the time for squabbling.
L345900	u1785	m118	JACK	I pray God grants it me.
L345899	u1790	m118	OONA	Courage, Jack.
L346627	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
L346626	u1785	m118	JACK	Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
L346573	u1785	m118	JACK	It's done... we'll never catch him.
L346572	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Sorry, Jack.
L346472	u1785	m118	JACK	Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
L346471	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Hello, Jack.
L346444	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
L346443	u1785	m118	JACK	Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
L346442	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
L346085	u1785	m118	JACK	Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
L346084	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What care the bones when the soul is free?
L346067	u1785	m118	JACK	His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
L346066	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
L346045	u1785	m118	JACK	Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
L346044	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Up ahead!
L346043	u1785	m118	JACK	Where?
L346038	u1785	m118	JACK	Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
L346037	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
L345990	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Small miracles better than no miracles...
L345989	u1785	m118	JACK	Praise be to God.
L345980	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
L345979	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm in your debt, Screwball.
L345967	u1785	m118	JACK	I think she's about to foal.
L345966	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What's she doing?
L345961	u1785	m118	JACK	We wait.
L345960	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What do we do now?
L345949	u1785	m118	JACK	I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
L345948	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	The fastest in the world.
L346238	u1792	m118	THURGIS	May God protect you.
L346237	u1785	m118	JACK	You're with us in battle.
L346131	u1792	m118	THURGIS	You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
L346130	u1785	m118	JACK	Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
L346129	u1792	m118	THURGIS	Uhm... fine work.
L346126	u1792	m118	THURGIS	Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
L346125	u1785	m118	JACK	The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
L346122	u1785	m118	JACK	I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
L346121	u1792	m118	THURGIS	How came you by this blade?
L346120	u1785	m118	JACK	Oh, but I have.
L346119	u1792	m118	THURGIS	Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
L346367	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
L346366	u1787	m118	JIMMY	In a dream.
L346365	u1785	m118	JACK	You've been inside?
L346364	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
L346355	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
L346354	u1785	m118	JACK	A castle's but stone and mortar --
L346353	u1787	m118	JIMMY	It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
L346322	u1787	m118	JIMMY	You follow.
L346321	u1785	m118	JACK	Let that be our problem, just get us there.
L346318	u1787	m118	JIMMY	That very nice.
L346317	u1785	m118	JACK	There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
L346316	u1787	m118	JIMMY	To Castle Couer de Noir?
L346315	u1785	m118	JACK	Can you show us the way?
L346312	u1785	m118	JACK	You do know where it is?
L346311	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
L346310	u1785	m118	JACK	Simple as that, eh?
L346308	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
L346307	u1785	m118	JACK	Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
L346306	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Lost?
L346303	u1787	m118	JIMMY	The Black Baron, you say?
L346302	u1785	m118	JACK	Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
L346300	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
L346299	u1785	m118	JACK	Is he a friend, then?
L346293	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm sending you back to Hell!
L346292	u1787	m118	JIMMY	No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
L357776	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	"Let me have it.  ""Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."""
L357775	u1892	m124	CLERK	Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
L357774	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
L357773	u1892	m124	CLERK	Yes, sir.
L357772	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
L357771	u1892	m124	CLERK	All of it?
L357768	u1892	m124	CLERK	Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford.
L357767	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	Oh, read it!
L357766	u1892	m124	CLERK	Cable from Gainsford.
L357226	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes.
L357225	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Two years!?
L357218	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
L357217	u1890	m124	BARNARD	What about those men we met this morning?
L357208	u1891	m124	CHANG	It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
L357207	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Not even a radio?
L357201	u1891	m124	CHANG	Thank you.
L357200	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
L357199	u1891	m124	CHANG	She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
L357198	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
L357661	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village?
L357660	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
L357527	u1890	m124	BARNARD	In a quandary.
L357526	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
L357525	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Come on, Lovey.
L357524	u1898	m124	LOVETT	They were in a quandary, and?
L357523	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
L357522	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"?then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, ""Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed."" And then the mama bear said, ""Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" And then the big papa bear, he roared, ""And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!"
L357520	u1898	m124	LOVETT	This doesn't obligate me in any way.
L357519	u1890	m124	BARNARD	There you are!
L357516	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Certainly not!
L357515	u1898	m124	LOVETT	And be poisoned out here in the open?
L357514	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
L357513	u1898	m124	LOVETT	So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
L357512	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
L357506	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Horns? What kind of horns?
L357505	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah. You know.
L357504	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Horns?
L357503	u1890	m124	BARNARD	They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
L357502	u1898	m124	LOVETT	And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
L357501	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, Lovey.
L357500	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
L357499	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Just call me Barney.
L357498	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
L357408	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sounds like a stall to me.
L357407	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.
L357377	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
L357376	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
L357375	u1898	m124	LOVETT	colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people?
L357374	u1890	m124	BARNARD	That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
L357368	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
L357367	u1898	m124	LOVETT	The police?
L357366	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
L357365	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Certainly not.
L357362	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
L357361	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Have I?
L357360	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
L357359	u1890	m124	BARNARD	And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
L357241	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
L357240	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.
L357239	u1890	m124	BARNARD	No kidding?
L357238	u1898	m124	LOVETT	As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
L357237	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
L357236	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm thinking.
L357235	u1890	m124	BARNARD	How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
L357179	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
L357178	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
L357177	u1898	m124	LOVETT	All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
L357176	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
L357174	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Please don't call me Lovey.
L357173	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
L357172	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
L357171	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
L357170	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
L357169	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Something tells me this means food. Come on!
L357168	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
L357167	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
L357166	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Will you stop squawking!
L357165	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
L357143	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Do you think they're cannibals?
L357142	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yes!
L357141	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Where are they? Do you see them?
L357124	u1890	m124	BARNARD	All right, all right. Keep quiet.
L357123	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
L357042	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
L357041	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
L357028	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
L357027	u1890	m124	BARNARD	He might have lost his way.
L357021	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Now you're irritating and absurd!
L357020	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
L357019	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is?  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
L357018	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yes.
L357017	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, really?
L357016	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
L357015	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south?
L357014	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Look here?
L357013	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It certainly is.
L357012	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Is it?
L357011	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's ridiculous.
L357010	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
L357009	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why, of course. Yes.
L357008	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
L357007	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm never conversational before I coffee.
L357006	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
L357005	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I see.
L357004	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I see.
L357003	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
L357000	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Good morning?
L356999	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I say, good morning, Lovey.
L356998	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I beg your pardon.
L356997	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Good morning, Lovey.
L356970	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
L356969	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Don't call me brother.
L356968	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, brother.
L356967	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes, it just shows?  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
L356965	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
L356964	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
L356963	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
L356962	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
L356961	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
L356960	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.
L356959	u1898	m124	LOVETT	This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
L356958	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sorry.
L356957	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Not at all.
L356956	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
L356955	u1898	m124	LOVETT	When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
L356954	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.
L356953	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Found in Asia!
L356952	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, what do you know about that!
L356951	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
L356950	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, I see.
L356949	u1898	m124	LOVETT	A paleontologist.
L356948	u1890	m124	BARNARD	A what?
L356947	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm a paleontologist.
L356946	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Fossils, huh?
L356945	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Fossils.
L356944	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
L357590	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right.
L357589	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
L357588	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Gold. You were going to?
L357587	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Huh?
L357586	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Say, what about that gold deal?
L357585	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Think of it! In times like these.
L357584	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's unbelievable.
L357583	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
L357404	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
L357403	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
L357370	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
L357369	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Chalmers Bryant!
L357364	u1890	m124	BARNARD	All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
L357363	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
L357351	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
L357350	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
L357234	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
L357233	u1890	m124	BARNARD	That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
L357181	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I'll say.
L357180	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
L357115	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
L357114	u1890	m124	BARNARD	What are we going to do?
L357040	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
L357039	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, that's that, I guess.
L357038	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
L357037	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Charming chap.
L357645	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
L357644	u1895	m124	GLORIA	If you want me to!
L357631	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
L357630	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
L357629	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
L357356	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Why, you look beautiful.
L357355	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Nothing. Why?
L357354	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey, what's happened to you?
L356975	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
L356974	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Say, you're an American, aren't you?
L356973	u1895	m124	GLORIA	No.
L356972	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I say, will you have a cigarette?
L357643	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
L357642	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
L357641	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business?
L357640	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
L357639	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well - I'm?
L357638	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You mean you don't want to go?
L357637	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
L357636	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
L357635	u1890	m124	BARNARD	When are you going to start?
L357634	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
L357633	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Leaving?
L357632	u1894	m124	GEORGE	There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
L357140	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Look, Bob!
L357139	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey - look!
L357138	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Over by that hill.
L357137	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Cave, eh? Where?
L357619	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
L357618	u1891	m124	CHANG	You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
L357613	u1891	m124	CHANG	Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
L357612	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
L357611	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
L357610	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
L357609	u1891	m124	CHANG	Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
L357608	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Suppose she should leave it?
L357607	u1891	m124	CHANG	Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
L357606	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
L357605	u1891	m124	CHANG	Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
L357604	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
L357603	u1891	m124	CHANG	Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
L357602	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes, charming.
L357601	u1891	m124	CHANG	Charming, isn't she?
L357598	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
L357597	u1891	m124	CHANG	Shall we have another?
L357596	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes. I'm afraid it does.
L357413	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
L357412	u1891	m124	CHANG	The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
L357411	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
L357410	u1891	m124	CHANG	The only one.
L357409	u1893	m124	CONWAY	One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
L357332	u1891	m124	CHANG	Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
L357331	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
L357330	u1891	m124	CHANG	I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
L357329	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I surprise you? Now that's news.
L357328	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
L357327	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
L357326	u1891	m124	CHANG	And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
L357325	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Very often.
L357324	u1891	m124	CHANG	"Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, ""He worried himself to death?"" or, ""This thing or that killed him?"""
L357323	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
L357322	u1891	m124	CHANG	You're startled?
L357321	u1893	m124	CONWAY	108 and still active?
L357320	u1891	m124	CHANG	Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
L357319	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, is it?
L357318	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
L357317	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, they didn't actually mean that.
L357316	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
L357315	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He amputated his own leg?
L357314	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
L357313	u1893	m124	CONWAY	When was all this?
L357312	u1891	m124	CHANG	A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
L357311	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who?
L357310	u1891	m124	CHANG	That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
L357309	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
L357308	u1891	m124	CHANG	Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
L357307	u1893	m124	CONWAY	?buy and sell?
L357306	u1891	m124	CHANG	Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
L357305	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
L357304	u1891	m124	CHANG	Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
L357303	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
L357302	u1891	m124	CHANG	Centuries.
L357301	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, it must have taken?
L357300	u1891	m124	CHANG	They were.
L357299	u1893	m124	CONWAY	But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
L357296	u1891	m124	CHANG	You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
L357295	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
L357294	u1891	m124	CHANG	Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
L357293	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
L357292	u1891	m124	CHANG	Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
L357291	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You have no disputes over women?
L357290	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
L357289	u1893	m124	CONWAY	How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
L357288	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, good heavens, no!
L357287	u1893	m124	CONWAY	How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
L357286	u1891	m124	CHANG	We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
L357285	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's intelligent.
L357284	u1891	m124	CHANG	To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including?  ?the excess of virtue itself.
L357283	u1891	m124	CHANG	We follow many.
L357282	u1893	m124	CONWAY	By the way, what religion do you follow here?
L357275	u1891	m124	CHANG	Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
L357274	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
L357273	u1891	m124	CHANG	There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
L357272	u1893	m124	CONWAY	For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
L357271	u1891	m124	CHANG	In time you will meet them all.
L357270	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who, for instance?
L357269	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, yes.
L357268	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So there are others?
L357267	u1891	m124	CHANG	Goodness, no!
L357266	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
L357265	u1891	m124	CHANG	It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
L357203	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
L357202	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And the wine - excellent.
L357160	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Thank you.
L357159	u1891	m124	CHANG	You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
L357154	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
L357153	u1891	m124	CHANG	Where is your mad pilot?
L357150	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction?
L357149	u1891	m124	CHANG	How do you do?
L357148	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And mine's Conway.

L357582	u1891	m124	CHANG	Thank you.
L357581	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, thank you. Thank you!
L357580	u1891	m124	CHANG	Then it's done.
L357579	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, immediately.
L357578	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
L357577	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
L357576	u1891	m124	CHANG	Splendid!
L357575	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
L357574	u1891	m124	CHANG	Now, what would you like to do?
L357573	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"Ungrateful fool . . . !  Those were my very words to myself last night. ""Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."""
L357572	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, no.
L357571	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, ""Lovey""?  Mr. Lovett! ""Mr. Lovett,"" I said, ""you are an ungrateful fool . . . """
L357570	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, I'm so glad.
L357569	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
L357568	u1891	m124	CHANG	You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
L357567	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
L357566	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes.
L357565	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
L357402	u1898	m124	LOVETT	The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
L357401	u1891	m124	CHANG	You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
L357224	u1891	m124	CHANG	Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
L357223	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"What exactly do you mean by ""almost any time now""?"
L357216	u1891	m124	CHANG	No.
L357215	u1898	m124	LOVETT	No porters here!!
L357214	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
L357213	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
L357617	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out?porters or no porters!
L357616	u1891	m124	CHANG	Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't?
L357615	u1894	m124	GEORGE	A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
L357406	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
L357405	u1891	m124	CHANG	The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
L357222	u1891	m124	CHANG	In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now?
L357221	u1894	m124	GEORGE	How can we get in touch with them?
L357220	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
L357212	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, dear.
L357211	u1894	m124	GEORGE	As far away as I ever want to be.
L357210	u1891	m124	CHANG	Are you so certain you are away from it?
L357209	u1894	m124	GEORGE	In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
L357156	u1891	m124	CHANG	Pardon me?
L357155	u1894	m124	GEORGE	We were just going to bury him when you came along.
L357761	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hey!
L357760	u1899	m124	MARIA	No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
L357743	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
L357742	u1899	m124	MARIA	Are you taking me?
L357734	u1899	m124	MARIA	No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
L357733	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're lying, aren't you?
L357730	u1899	m124	MARIA	I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
L357729	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes.
L357728	u1899	m124	MARIA	Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
L357727	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
L357726	u1899	m124	MARIA	He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
L357725	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault is dead.
L357724	u1899	m124	MARIA	The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
L357723	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
L357722	u1899	m124	MARIA	I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
L357721	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
L357720	u1899	m124	MARIA	It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
L357435	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
L357434	u1893	m124	CONWAY	But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
L357433	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
L357432	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
L357431	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
L357430	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, the girl at the piano?
L357429	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sondra Bizet.
L357428	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
L357427	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
L357425	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
L357424	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago?  ?you're still alive, Father Perrault!
L357423	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	What is it, my son?
L357422	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's astonishing - and incredible, but?
L357421	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as?
L357420	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
L357419	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Yes.
L357418	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Are you the High Lama?
L357417	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
L357627	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Do you think this will come in my time?
L357626	u1897	m124	LAMA	I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
L357624	u1897	m124	LAMA	Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
L357623	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mine?
L357622	u1897	m124	LAMA	You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
L357621	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
L357620	u1897	m124	LAMA	Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
L357763	u1893	m124	CONWAY	As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
L357762	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
L357759	u1893	m124	CONWAY	There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
L357758	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
L357750	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
L357749	u1894	m124	GEORGE	was saying?
L357748	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What was that?
L357747	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
L357741	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! We're wasting time!
L357740	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
L357739	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What about the others?
L357738	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, everything!
L357737	u1893	m124	CONWAY	The clothes?
L357736	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L357735	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You say the porters are waiting for us?
L357732	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
L357731	u1894	m124	GEORGE	She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
L357714	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
L357713	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
L357712	u1894	m124	GEORGE	So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
L357711	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
L357710	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're wrong, George.
L357709	u1894	m124	GEORGE	This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
L357708	u1893	m124	CONWAY	She came here in 1888!
L357707	u1894	m124	GEORGE	"What do you mean - ""fade away like an echo""?"
L357706	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
L357705	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why not?
L357704	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You can't take her away from here!
L357702	u1894	m124	GEORGE	She's going with me.
L357701	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What's she got to do with it?
L357700	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, the little Russian girl.
L357699	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Maria?
L357698	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
L357697	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
L357696	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
L357695	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
L357694	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'd go mad!
L357693	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
L357692	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
L357691	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, George . . .
L357690	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
L357689	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
L357688	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned?
L357687	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
L357686	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
L357685	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
L357684	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
L357683	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
L357682	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
L357681	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Is that all my story meant to you?
L357680	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
L357679	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't need any proof.
L357678	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
L357677	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
L357676	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
L357675	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So you think I'm mad?
L357674	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
L357672	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
L357671	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
L357670	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
L357669	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
L357668	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
L357667	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why not? What's going to stop me?
L357666	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You can't leave, George.
L357665	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
L357594	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't see that there's anything to say.
L357593	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
L357445	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
L357444	u1894	m124	GEORGE	For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of?
L357442	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why - I'm sorry - but I?
L357441	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
L357440	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Porters?
L357439	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What about the porters?
L357392	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right. Sorry, George.
L357391	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Let me up! Let me up!
L357387	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Chang! Chang! Chang!
L357386	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, come back!
L357385	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Let me go, Bob!
L357384	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, what do you think you're doing?
L357349	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Shhh!
L357348	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
L357347	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
L357346	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
L357345	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Porters?
L357344	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Nothing about the porters yet?
L357343	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
L357264	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's what's on the other side of the hill.
L357263	u1894	m124	GEORGE	There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
L357262	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Uh-huh.
L357261	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Chang's first question was about the pilot.
L357260	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
L357259	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
L357258	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well - I mean?
L357257	u1894	m124	GEORGE	That's what you said.
L357256	u1893	m124	CONWAY	"Did I say ""if""?"
L357255	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What do you mean if we should get out?
L357254	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
L357253	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
L357252	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
L357251	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
L357250	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know.
L357249	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What are you talking about?
L357248	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
L357247	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You talk as though you intend on staying.
L357246	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
L357245	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
L357244	u1893	m124	CONWAY	We've had plenty of it the last few days.
L357243	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
L357242	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello, George.  Cigarette?
L357108	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
L357107	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What's it mean?
L357106	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
L357105	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L357104	u1893	m124	CONWAY	See that spot?
L357103	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What is it?
L357101	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Dead?
L357100	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He's dead.
L357098	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
L357097	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What is it? Has he fainted?
L357084	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
L357083	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh George, come on.
L357064	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
L357063	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What are these people?
L357048	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
L357047	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, what are you going to do?
L357034	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
L357033	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, stop it!
L356995	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
L356994	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Do try to sleep, Bob.
L356993	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
L356991	u1893	m124	CONWAY	"Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, ""Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?""  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - ""Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?"" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants?  ?and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum."
L356990	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
L356989	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
L356988	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356987	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Did you say we saved ninety white people?
L356986	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, Bob.
L356985	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
L356982	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
L356981	u1894	m124	GEORGE	"How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, ""There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."""
L356980	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hurray!
L356979	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
L356978	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You?
L356977	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Just what I needed too.
L356943	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
L356942	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
L356926	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! Quick! This way.
L356925	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob, these are all that are left.
L356921	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Right, Bob.
L356920	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
L356919	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
L356918	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
L356904	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello? Colonel?
L356903	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356902	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And be sure that none of the natives get in.
L356901	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356900	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
L356899	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob! I think I hear motors!
L357152	u1893	m124	CONWAY	We'd be eternally grateful if you?
L357151	u1898	m124	LOVETT	At the mercy of a mad pilot.
L357080	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
L357079	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
L357067	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Where are we going? Huh?
L357066	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
L357060	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
L357059	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why, you - you? Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
L357058	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What do you suggest?
L357057	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
L357056	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
L357055	u1898	m124	LOVETT	In for what?
L357054	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I guess we're in for it.
L357052	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
L357051	u1898	m124	LOVETT	We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
L357050	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What if he refuses?
L357049	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Good.
L357046	u1898	m124	LOVETT	What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
L357045	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That fellow got on at Baskul.
L357044	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
L357043	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
L356941	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
L356940	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly?
L356939	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Where were you hiding?
L356936	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why aren't you registered through our office?
L356935	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
L356934	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Where did you come from?
L357564	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
L357563	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
L357561	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357560	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I'd love it!
L357559	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Would you like to wring my little neck?
L357558	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
L357557	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why, mother?
L357556	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
L357555	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I was just going to.
L357554	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
L357553	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357552	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
L357551	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Struggling, why?
L357550	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
L357549	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357548	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
L357547	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
L357546	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
L357545	u1900	m124	SONDRA	You see, it's not a dream.
L357544	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Ouch!
L357543	u1893	m124	CONWAY	When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
L357542	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Bump?
L357541	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
L357497	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
L357496	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
L357495	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I wonder.
L357494	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
L357493	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
L357492	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm so glad.
L357491	u1893	m124	CONWAY	On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
L357490	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
L357489	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
L357488	u1900	m124	SONDRA	What is?
L357485	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
L357484	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm thirty.
L357483	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
L357482	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes, I know.
L357481	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
L357480	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
L357479	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Thank you.
L357478	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
L357477	u1893	m124	CONWAY	There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
L357476	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
L357475	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
L357474	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
L357473	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes.
L357472	u1893	m124	CONWAY	A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
L357471	u1900	m124	SONDRA	As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
L357470	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
L357469	u1893	m124	CONWAY	A man whose life was empty!
L357468	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I saw a man whose life was empty.
L357467	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
L357466	u1900	m124	SONDRA	That was easy. I read your books.
L357465	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
L357464	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes. Hold this pigeon.
L357463	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Was this your idea?
L357460	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Oh, you mean my pigeons.
L357459	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
L357458	u1893	m124	CONWAY	hope you'll forgive me for?
L357457	u1900	m124	SONDRA	My name's Sondra.
L357456	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
L357654	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.  Barney!
L357653	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'll wait till you rot!
L357652	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
L357651	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
L357650	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
L357649	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
L357648	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Go? Where?
L357647	u1894	m124	GEORGE	How about you? Do you want to go?
L357231	u1894	m124	GEORGE	We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
L357230	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
L357205	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
L357204	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
L357147	u1898	m124	LOVETT	English!

L357129	u1898	m124	LOVETT	What is it?
L357082	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
L357081	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What do you want him to do?
L357026	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It's Fenner.
L357025	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
L357024	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
L357023	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
L356938	u1898	m124	LOVETT	How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
L356937	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It would serve you right if you were left behind.
L357539	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
L357538	u1899	m124	MARIA	Thank you.
L357537	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right, I'll be there.

L357535	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Perhaps.
L357534	u1899	m124	MARIA	I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
L357533	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
L357532	u1899	m124	MARIA	You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
L357278	u1899	m124	MARIA	Please don't go.
L357277	u1894	m124	GEORGE	EXCUSE ME?
L381603	u1906	m125	KAY	Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
L381602	u1901	m125	COWAN	And if I say yes?
L381601	u1906	m125	KAY	It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
L381598	u1906	m125	KAY	Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
L381597	u1901	m125	COWAN	Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.

L381565	u1906	m125	KAY	It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
L381564	u1901	m125	COWAN	Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
L381558	u1906	m125	KAY	Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
L381557	u1901	m125	COWAN	of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
L381556	u1906	m125	KAY	Cowan--
L381555	u1901	m125	COWAN	"Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking ""how can he think with a hook for a head?"" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--"

L381544	u1906	m125	KAY	I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.

L381640	u1901	m125	COWAN	So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
L381634	u1913	m125	ZED	Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.

L381600	u1901	m125	COWAN	What happens if I say no?
L381599	u1913	m125	ZED	Only the damn guy won't know it.
L381594	u1913	m125	ZED	Mrs. Edelson?
L381593	u1901	m125	COWAN	No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
L381592	u1913	m125	ZED	You think we're nuts.
L381538	u1913	m125	ZED	We're the government, Cowan.
L381537	u1901	m125	COWAN	Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
L381536	u1913	m125	ZED	For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
L381535	u1901	m125	COWAN	"Well... you know, when you say ""normal,"" what, exactly..."
L381521	u1901	m125	COWAN	"I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. ""Best of the best of the best... "" I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir."

L381513	u1913	m125	ZED	They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
L381512	u1901	m125	COWAN	They don't?
L381511	u1913	m125	ZED	Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
L381510	u1901	m125	COWAN	... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
L381505	u1901	m125	COWAN	Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.

L381503	u1901	m125	COWAN	All the time, sir.
L381502	u1911	m125	WALLACE	Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
L381501	u1901	m125	COWAN	Actually, sir--
L381500	u1911	m125	WALLACE	Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
L381499	u1901	m125	COWAN	Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
L381498	u1911	m125	WALLACE	Well this didn't.

L381773	u1904	m125	JAY	Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.

L381737	u1906	m125	KAY	You don't know the half of it.
L381736	u1904	m125	JAY	I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
L381735	u1906	m125	KAY	If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.

L381730	u1904	m125	JAY	I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
L381729	u1906	m125	KAY	She didn't even know you. .
L381728	u1904	m125	JAY	I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.

L381693	u1906	m125	KAY	Keep her out of here while I check it out.
L381692	u1904	m125	JAY	I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.

L381667	u1904	m125	JAY	I know, but we're on a college campus...
L381666	u1906	m125	KAY	It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
L381665	u1904	m125	JAY	I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
L381660	u1904	m125	JAY	Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
L381659	u1906	m125	KAY	So what's the problem?
L381658	u1904	m125	JAY	So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
L381655	u1904	m125	JAY	But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
L381654	u1906	m125	KAY	Right.
L381653	u1904	m125	JAY	It's a bug.
L381650	u1904	m125	JAY	I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
L381649	u1906	m125	KAY	The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
L381648	u1904	m125	JAY	Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
L381647	u1906	m125	KAY	We wear black.
L381646	u1904	m125	JAY	Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
L382030	u1904	m125	JAY	Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
L382029	u1913	m125	ZED	I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.

L382012	u1913	m125	ZED	Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
L381938	u1904	m125	JAY	Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
L381937	u1913	m125	ZED	Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
L381936	u1904	m125	JAY	I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
L382236	u1904	m125	JAY	Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
L382235	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Yeah ... ?
L382234	u1904	m125	JAY	They respond to fear, right?
L382233	u1907	m125	LAUREL	What are you doing?
L382230	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Are you sure you don't?
L382229	u1904	m125	JAY	What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
L382228	u1907	m125	LAUREL	The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
L382227	u1904	m125	JAY	Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
L382189	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Out of focus?
L382188	u1904	m125	JAY	Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
L382157	u1904	m125	JAY	Actually... I don't know.
L382156	u1907	m125	LAUREL	What the hell does that mean?
L382155	u1904	m125	JAY	What do we do?    Lean into it.
L382154	u1907	m125	LAUREL	What do we do?
L382110	u1904	m125	JAY	So... how did they get here?
L382109	u1907	m125	LAUREL	It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
L382108	u1904	m125	JAY	When?
L382099	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
L382098	u1904	m125	JAY	But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
L382097	u1907	m125	LAUREL	It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
L382096	u1904	m125	JAY	What is it?
L382095	u1907	m125	LAUREL	I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
L382075	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
L382074	u1904	m125	JAY	Why not?
L382073	u1907	m125	LAUREL	I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
L382072	u1904	m125	JAY	I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
L382071	u1907	m125	LAUREL	It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
L382068	u1904	m125	JAY	Actually, you may have.
L382067	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
L381710	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Do have any idea what I just said?
L381709	u1904	m125	JAY	Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
L381708	u1907	m125	LAUREL	With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
L381707	u1904	m125	JAY	Right, right-- I like that stuff.
L381698	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
L381697	u1904	m125	JAY	Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
L381696	u1907	m125	LAUREL	So... how'd you hear about this?
L381683	u1904	m125	JAY	I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
L381682	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
L381681	u1907	m125	LAUREL	Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
L381680	u1904	m125	JAY	So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
L381864	u1905	m125	JEEBS	You're not taking me in!

L381846	u1906	m125	KAY	You figured what?

L381839	u1906	m125	KAY	Maybe you need a closer look.
L381838	u1905	m125	JEEBS	No.
L381837	u1906	m125	KAY	What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?

L382194	u1906	m125	KAY	Goodwill...
L382179	u1912	m125	YAZ	Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
L382178	u1906	m125	KAY	Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?

L381995	u1906	m125	KAY	Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
L381994	u1912	m125	YAZ	How could it not?
L381993	u1906	m125	KAY	Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?

L381933	u1906	m125	KAY	Dee?  What are you doing here?
L381932	u1913	m125	ZED	They're gone.
L381888	u1906	m125	KAY	Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
L381887	u1913	m125	ZED	Hard to tell.  I hope not.
L381886	u1906	m125	KAY	Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
L381885	u1913	m125	ZED	Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
L381884	u1913	m125	ZED	Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
L381883	u1906	m125	KAY	What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
L381882	u1913	m125	ZED	He's gone, too.
L381780	u1906	m125	KAY	What the hell is going on?
L381779	u1913	m125	ZED	I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
L381778	u1906	m125	KAY	Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
L381777	u1913	m125	ZED	Kay?  What's your 20?
L381596	u1913	m125	ZED	So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
L381595	u1906	m125	KAY	Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
L381468	u1906	m125	KAY	Fine.  Good.
L381467	u1913	m125	ZED	How's Dee?
L381992	u1912	m125	YAZ	That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
L381991	u1910	m125	PRESIDENT	And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
L381990	u1912	m125	YAZ	A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
L381989	u1910	m125	PRESIDENT	If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
L381988	u1912	m125	YAZ	Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
L381987	u1912	m125	YAZ	That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
L381986	u1910	m125	PRESIDENT	Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
L381985	u1912	m125	YAZ	Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
L379536	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
L379535	u2073	m134	HALDEN	You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
L379534	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	True.
L379533	u2073	m134	HALDEN	System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
L379530	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
L379529	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes, I believe he has --
L379528	u2073	m134	HALDEN	God-Damn you!
L379526	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
L379525	u2073	m134	HALDEN	They have nothing to do with this --
L379524	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379523	u2073	m134	HALDEN	There are two million people in there with you.
L379522	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	I need to take back what's mine.
L379521	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What do you need?
L379520	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
L379519	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What do you want?
L379518	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
L379517	u2073	m134	HALDEN	This is Halden.
L379663	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
L379662	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	Why --
L379661	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Because I took it out of your memory.
L379660	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	How come I can't remember?
L379659	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
L379658	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	She said I have a son...
L379656	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	To live forever.
L379655	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	Why?
L379653	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's all been transferred.
L379652	u2070	m134	DIGITAL GENA	Okay...
L379651	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's okay.
L379649	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	From the dream.
L379648	u2072	m134	GENA	Wake up?!
L379647	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's time to wake up.
L379645	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Nothing, go back to sleep.
L379644	u2072	m134	GENA	What's happening?
L379638	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
L379637	u2072	m134	GENA	But this is impossible.
L379635	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Just like you always wanted.
L379634	u2072	m134	GENA	Guests?
L379633	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	The guests are here.
L379631	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379630	u2072	m134	GENA	It's all here...
L379452	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	No...
L379451	u2072	m134	GENA	You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
L379429	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Someone who believes in miracles.
L379428	u2072	m134	GENA	Who are you?!
L379424	u2072	m134	GENA	About what?
L379423	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	You were right.
L379421	u2072	m134	GENA	I'm serious, how did you know my name?
L379420	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Do you believe in miracles?
L379418	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
L379417	u2072	m134	GENA	No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
L379416	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Your life that bad?
L379414	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- No.
L379413	u2072	m134	GENA	This is how you pick up women --
L379412	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
L379411	u2072	m134	GENA	That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
L379410	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
L379409	u2072	m134	GENA	As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
L379861	u2078	m134	TANNER	And down here --
L379860	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Only up there in the dream they called life.
L379859	u2078	m134	TANNER	But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
L379858	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	One would assume so.
L379857	u2078	m134	TANNER	Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
L379855	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379854	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- Two million people plugged-in here.
L379853	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
L379850	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
L379849	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
L379848	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
L379734	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
L379733	u2078	m134	TANNER	Dream?!
L379732	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
L379731	u2078	m134	TANNER	You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
L379730	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes...
L379729	u2078	m134	TANNER	You were the one who was dying.
L379718	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Not real?
L379717	u2078	m134	TANNER	It's not real.
L379716	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	The new world.
L379715	u2078	m134	TANNER	In a computer program.
L379714	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
L379713	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	In here I am.
L379712	u2078	m134	TANNER	You are not a God.
L379711	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Yes.
L379710	u2078	m134	TANNER	Divinity?
L379708	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	So wrong --
L379707	u2078	m134	TANNER	Not my problem.
L379706	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
L379704	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Then what?
L379703	u2078	m134	TANNER	No.
L379702	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
L379701	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	True.  But why?
L379700	u2078	m134	TANNER	The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
L379557	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	-- He will.
L379556	u2069	m134	DEX	But what if he doesn't --
L379555	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	It's his nature.
L379554	u2069	m134	DEX	You sure he's going to come?
L379553	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
L379552	u2069	m134	DEX	And what about the reconfiguration?
L379551	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Unfinished business.
L379550	u2069	m134	DEX	Where the hell are you going?
L379549	u2069	m134	DEX	Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
L379548	u2068	m134	CHRISTOPH	Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
L379543	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
L379542	u2071	m134	EMMA	The maze has been changed --
L379540	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
L379539	u2071	m134	EMMA	What about the customers with reservations?
L379538	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
L379504	u2071	m134	EMMA	At least a day.
L379503	u2073	m134	HALDEN	How long?
L379502	u2071	m134	EMMA	We're going to have to reconfigure.
L379501	u2073	m134	HALDEN	How long 'till we can eject?
L379402	u2072	m134	GENA	Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
L379401	u2078	m134	TANNER	Take care.
L379395	u2078	m134	TANNER	There is no --
L379394	u2072	m134	GENA	The woman you're stuck on.
L379393	u2078	m134	TANNER	Who?
L379392	u2072	m134	GENA	What's her name?
L379390	u2072	m134	GENA	The weather.
L379389	u2078	m134	TANNER	What?
L379387	u2072	m134	GENA	I'm South Dakota.
L379386	u2078	m134	TANNER	New York.
L379385	u2072	m134	GENA	Where you plugged-in from?
L379778	u2078	m134	TANNER	If she's alive, you get it back.
L379777	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Insurance?
L379776	u2078	m134	TANNER	Insurance.
L379775	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Need the disk back!
L379773	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Times Square.
L379772	u2078	m134	TANNER	Where?
L379771	u2073	m134	HALDEN	An interface attendant.
L379768	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Come on Tanner, think this through.
L379767	u2078	m134	TANNER	Then where is she?
L379766	u2073	m134	HALDEN	There was no need to kill her.
L379765	u2078	m134	TANNER	Try harder.
L379764	u2073	m134	HALDEN	We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
L379763	u2078	m134	TANNER	To hide the evidence.
L379762	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Why would I do that?
L379761	u2078	m134	TANNER	Then you had her killed.
L379760	u2078	m134	TANNER	Katie was digitized.
L379759	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Not his style.
L379758	u2078	m134	TANNER	The truth.
L379757	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What did he tell you?
L379617	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- Who did he digitize?!
L379616	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
L379615	u2078	m134	TANNER	Who did he digitize?
L379614	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
L379613	u2078	m134	TANNER	Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
L379610	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Good question.
L379609	u2078	m134	TANNER	Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
L379608	u2073	m134	HALDEN	That's right.
L379607	u2078	m134	TANNER	Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
L379606	u2073	m134	HALDEN	He wouldn't say.
L379605	u2078	m134	TANNER	Why?
L379604	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
L379603	u2073	m134	HALDEN	It's not used for anything.
L379602	u2078	m134	TANNER	A hotel?
L379601	u2073	m134	HALDEN	The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
L379600	u2078	m134	TANNER	What is it?
L379595	u2078	m134	TANNER	The truth.
L379594	u2073	m134	HALDEN	What?
L379593	u2078	m134	TANNER	One condition.
L379589	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- Christoph changed the maze.
L379588	u2078	m134	TANNER	You've got the keys, send someone in --
L379587	u2073	m134	HALDEN	The only way to eject it is from the inside.
L379584	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
L379583	u2078	m134	TANNER	Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
L379582	u2078	m134	TANNER	And you weren't involved.
L379581	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
L379580	u2078	m134	TANNER	Corporate fingerprints all over it.
L379579	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- I saw the program.
L379578	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
L379577	u2078	m134	TANNER	Try harder.
L379574	u2078	m134	TANNER	He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
L379573	u2073	m134	HALDEN	You're jumping to conclusions.
L379509	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Go!
L379508	u2078	m134	TANNER	We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
L379494	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- Yes.
L379493	u2078	m134	TANNER	He had access to the keys --
L379486	u2073	m134	HALDEN	-- He won't.
L379485	u2078	m134	TANNER	Won't be time if he gets access --
L379472	u2078	m134	TANNER	Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
L379471	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Two maze runners.
L379433	u2078	m134	TANNER	Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
L379432	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
L379336	u2078	m134	TANNER	But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
L379335	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
L379331	u2073	m134	HALDEN	Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
L379330	u2078	m134	TANNER	He had keys.
L379838	u2074	m134	KATIE	There was no other choice.
L379837	u2078	m134	TANNER	Sorry?!
L379836	u2074	m134	KATIE	I'm sorry.
L379832	u2074	m134	KATIE	What's the difference?
L379831	u2078	m134	TANNER	Not you.  A copy.
L379830	u2074	m134	KATIE	But you were with me.
L379829	u2078	m134	TANNER	I know.
L379828	u2074	m134	KATIE	I wasn't with you.
L379826	u2074	m134	KATIE	Way you kiss me.
L379825	u2078	m134	TANNER	What?
L379821	u2078	m134	TANNER	Yes.
L379820	u2074	m134	KATIE	And it meant something.
L379816	u2078	m134	TANNER	You weren't real.
L379815	u2074	m134	KATIE	Realize?
L379814	u2078	m134	TANNER	To see how long it would take for me to realize.
L379813	u2074	m134	KATIE	For what?
L379812	u2078	m134	TANNER	It was a test.
L379811	u2074	m134	KATIE	Why?
L379810	u2078	m134	TANNER	Once they digitized you, they added it.
L379809	u2074	m134	KATIE	But I don't know anything about programming.
L379808	u2078	m134	TANNER	Yes.
L379807	u2074	m134	KATIE	You said we were on the same programming team.
L379805	u2074	m134	KATIE	Her?
L379804	u2078	m134	TANNER	That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
L379803	u2078	m134	TANNER	Corporation can.
L379802	u2074	m134	KATIE	That's not possible.  No one can do that.
L379801	u2078	m134	TANNER	Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
L379794	u2078	m134	TANNER	Night City.
L379793	u2074	m134	KATIE	-- The inside?
L379792	u2078	m134	TANNER	We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
L379791	u2074	m134	KATIE	Who are you?!
L379790	u2078	m134	TANNER	Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
L379788	u2074	m134	KATIE	What are you talking about?
L379787	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- You told me.
L379786	u2074	m134	KATIE	Then how do you know about --
L379785	u2078	m134	TANNER	No.
L379784	u2074	m134	KATIE	You went to my high-school?
L379781	u2078	m134	TANNER	-- Katie.
L379780	u2074	m134	KATIE	I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
L379743	u2078	m134	TANNER	No.
L379742	u2074	m134	KATIE	Someone you have to get back to?
L379380	u2074	m134	KATIE	Tanner.
L379379	u2078	m134	TANNER	I've got to get back.
L379378	u2074	m134	KATIE	Some things never change, do they?
L379377	u2078	m134	TANNER	Cleaning up a mess.
L379376	u2074	m134	KATIE	What brings you inside?
L379463	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
L379462	u2075	m134	KID	Don't know what you're talking about.
L379448	u2075	m134	KID	Just like that --
L379447	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Just like that?
L379446	u2075	m134	KID	My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
L379445	u2076	m134	LAWYER	There?
L379444	u2075	m134	KID	It was just there.
L379443	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Try me.
L379442	u2075	m134	KID	Because you'll never believe me.
L379441	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Why not?
L379440	u2075	m134	KID	This.  No point to it.
L379439	u2076	m134	LAWYER	What's so funny?
L379438	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
L379437	u2075	m134	KID	Don't know what you're talking about.
L379436	u2076	m134	LAWYER	You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
L379435	u2075	m134	KID	Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
L379434	u2076	m134	LAWYER	Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

L401318	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Well, okay then.
L401317	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
L401316	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I never killed a priest before.
L401315	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	Priests. Imhotep's priests.
L401314	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Who the hell are these guys?
L401267	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
L401266	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You know where he's taking her?
L401083	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
L401082	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
L401081	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Relax, I got him.
L401080	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
L401278	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Did you say 'kill' my sister?
L401277	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
L401274	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Excuse me?
L401273	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	And then killing your sister.
L401272	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Oh yes, of course.
L401271	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	By reading the Book Of The Dead.
L401270	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And how does one do that?
L401269	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
L401268	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And what ritual would that be?
L401091	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	You're not going to kill us?
L401090	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
L401195	u2202	m142	BENI	Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
L401194	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What does he want the book for?
L401193	u2202	m142	BENI	The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
L401192	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
L401191	u2202	m142	BENI	You shall see.
L401190	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Immune from what?
L401189	u2202	m142	BENI	It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
L401188	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
L401187	u2202	m142	BENI	What friend? You're my only friend.
L401186	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Where's your new friend?
L401125	u2202	m142	BENI	Do you know where I can steal some?
L401124	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
L401123	u2202	m142	BENI	He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
L401122	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
L401121	u2202	m142	BENI	The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
L401120	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
L401119	u2202	m142	BENI	This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
L401118	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
L401117	u2202	m142	BENI	You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
L401116	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
L400968	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	'Cause I look good doin, it.
L400967	u2202	m142	BENI	Why do you like to fight so much?
L400966	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	C'mon, friend.
L400965	u2202	m142	BENI	Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
L400964	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Goin' somewhere?
L400915	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I've had worse.
L400914	u2202	m142	BENI	Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
L400856	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
L400855	u2202	m142	BENI	Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
L400836	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Sounds familiar.
L400835	u2202	m142	BENI	O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
L400834	u2202	m142	BENI	Even?
L400833	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Let's make us even, shall we?
L400832	u2202	m142	BENI	You always did have more balls than brains.
L400831	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
L400829	u2202	m142	BENI	Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
L400828	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
L400827	u2202	m142	BENI	You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
L400826	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
L400825	u2202	m142	BENI	My very good friend! What a surprise.
L400645	u2202	m142	BENI	Then what the hell are you doing here!?
L400644	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	None of the above, thank you.
L400643	u2202	m142	BENI	What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
L400641	u2202	m142	BENI	Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
L400640	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Altar boys?
L400639	u2202	m142	BENI	I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
L400638	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
L400636	u2202	m142	BENI	In the desert? What for?
L400635	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Now go find me a big stick.
L400631	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
L400630	u2202	m142	BENI	Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
L401311	u2202	m142	BENI	Yeah! Them.
L401310	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Intestines.
L401309	u2202	m142	BENI	...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
L401302	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh yes, always.
L401301	u2202	m142	BENI	Yeah?
L401290	u2202	m142	BENI	All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
L401289	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What just happened?
L401050	u2205	m142	EVELYN	That's one way of putting it.
L401049	u2202	m142	BENI	Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
L401221	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Exactly --
L401220	u2203	m142	CURATOR	-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
L401219	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
L401168	u2203	m142	CURATOR	It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
L401167	u2205	m142	EVELYN	In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
L401161	u2203	m142	CURATOR	To have stopped this creature? Yes!
L401160	u2205	m142	EVELYN	And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
L401153	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
L401152	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What is he doing here?
L401151	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
L400684	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Perhaps.
L400683	u2205	m142	EVELYN	See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
L400665	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
L400664	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
L400663	u2203	m142	CURATOR	When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
L400662	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm sorry, it was an accident.
L400779	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
L400778	u2207	m142	HOOK	It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
L400777	u2203	m142	CURATOR	And burn the map and retrieve the key.
L400776	u2207	m142	HOOK	Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
L400775	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
L400774	u2207	m142	HOOK	The key!? She has the lost key!?
L400772	u2203	m142	CURATOR	No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
L400771	u2207	m142	HOOK	She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
L401237	u2203	m142	CURATOR	If we want to kill the creature, yes.
L401236	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
L401235	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
L401225	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Correct, And that's when --
L401224	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
L401223	u2203	m142	CURATOR	-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
L401222	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
L401163	u2203	m142	CURATOR	According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
L401162	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
L401157	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Try me.
L401156	u2203	m142	CURATOR	You will not believe it.
L401155	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
L401203	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
L401202	u2204	m142	DANIELS	The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
L401180	u2204	m142	DANIELS	Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
L401179	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
L401089	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	What did you do to him!?
L401088	u2204	m142	DANIELS	You bastards!
L401054	u2204	m142	DANIELS	Water turning to blood.
L401053	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	The sun turning black.
L401032	u2204	m142	DANIELS	Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
L401031	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
L400975	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
L400974	u2204	m142	DANIELS	See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
L400900	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
L400899	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
L400798	u2210	m142	WARDEN	I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
L400797	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What are you doing here?
L400796	u2210	m142	WARDEN	A bright good morning to all.
L400767	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Forty.
L400766	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Twenty.
L400765	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Fifty percent.
L400764	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
L400763	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
L400762	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I would never!
L400761	u2210	m142	WARDEN	You lie.
L400753	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Three hundred pounds!
L400752	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Proceed!
L400751	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Two hundred pounds.
L400750	u2210	m142	WARDEN	I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
L400749	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
L400748	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I am an English woman.
L400747	u2210	m142	WARDEN	No women allowed.
L400745	u2210	m142	WARDEN	To be hanged.
L400744	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Where are they taking him?
L400710	u2210	m142	WARDEN	He said... he was just looking for a good time.
L400709	u2205	m142	EVELYN	And what did he say?
L400708	u2210	m142	WARDEN	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
L400707	u2205	m142	EVELYN	And what is he in prison for?
L401255	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
L401254	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Got guts, lady.
L401249	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I have no choice.
L401248	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Don't do it, Evelyn.
L401229	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Got what?
L401228	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Got it!
L401210	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
L401209	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I think you were jealous
L401208	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
L401207	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You called me your girl?
L401143	u2205	m142	EVELYN	The creature!? Are you sure!?
L401142	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
L401115	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	FINE.
L401114	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm staying.
L401113	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
L401112	u2205	m142	EVELYN	That's what I am to you? A contract?
L401111	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
L401110	u2205	m142	EVELYN	It's everybody's problem!
L401109	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
L401108	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
L401107	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
L401106	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
L401104	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
L401103	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
L401102	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
L401100	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No, we are not.
L401099	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
L401098	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
L401058	u2205	m142	EVELYN	It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
L401057	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
L401048	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
L401047	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
L401046	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	That bad huh?
L401045	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
L401042	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Very slowly.
L401041	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
L401020	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
L401019	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Is he supposed to look like that?
L401012	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You dream about dead guys?
L401011	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
L400998	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
L400997	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No... Why?... Should I?
L400992	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Because that's my name.
L400991	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Why would I do that?
L400990	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Not unless you call me Rick.
L400989	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm not?
L400988	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No you're not.
L400987	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
L400985	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	And what is that?
L400984	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
L400983	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
L400982	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
L400981	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Something like that.
L400980	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
L400979	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
L400957	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
L400956	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You don't believe in curses, huh?
L400955	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You two!
L400953	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
L400952	u2205	m142	EVELYN	How?
L400951	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
L400946	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Who was talking about what?
L400945	u2205	m142	EVELYN	A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
L400942	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
L400941	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
L400938	u2205	m142	EVELYN	They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
L400937	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
L400936	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
L400933	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
L400932	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
L400908	u2205	m142	EVELYN	For entering the afterlife.
L400907	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Preparation for what?
L400906	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
L400898	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
L400897	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What are those mirrors for?
L400896	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
L400895	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The things that get you excited.
L400894	u2205	m142	EVELYN	"That ""thing"" gets me excited."
L400880	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We're about to be shown the way.
L400879	u2205	m142	EVELYN	For what?
L400870	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Are you sure?
L400869	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We're almost there.
L400849	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Trust me.
L400848	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
L400847	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Can you swim?
L400843	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh that's comforting.
L400842	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
L400821	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I know my treasure.
L400820	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You know your history.
L400819	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
L400818	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
L400817	u2205	m142	EVELYN	"Ahmar is Ossirion. ""Passageway to the underworld"", actually."
L400816	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	"Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, ""the doorway to hell."""
L400815	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
L400814	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
L400813	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
L400812	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
L400811	u2205	m142	EVELYN	If you call that a kiss.
L400810	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
L400809	u2205	m142	EVELYN	The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
L400808	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
L400769	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
L400768	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
L400741	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Really want to know?
L400740	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes.
L400739	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Want to know?
L400738	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
L400737	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I found sand. I saw death.
L400736	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What did you find? What did you see?
L400735	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
L400734	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No, I mean --
L400733	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Every damn day.
L400732	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You swear?
L400731	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah, I was there.
L400730	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, well...  I know my brother.
L400729	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I just decked your brother
L400728	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You were actually at Hamunaptra?
L400724	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Because that's where I found it. I was there.
L400723	u2205	m142	EVELYN	How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
L400722	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
L400721	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No?
L400720	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No.
L400719	u2205	m142	EVELYN	We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
L400714	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Broad?!
L400713	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	So who's the broad?
L401353	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes,... I see.
L401352	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
L401350	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What's it look like!?
L401349	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
L401348	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Oh.
L401347	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Finish the inscription, idiot!
L401339	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Read the inscription on the cover!
L401338	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
L401334	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Shut-up and get me off of here!
L401333	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I found it, Evy! I found it
L401022	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
L401021	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Juicy?
L400995	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Well neither do I, thank you.
L400994	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
L400993	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
L400950	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Did you ever see him eat?
L400949	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What do you suppose killed him?
L400931	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Still...
L400930	u2205	m142	EVELYN	It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
L400919	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
L400918	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
L400884	u2205	m142	EVELYN	After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
L400883	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
L400785	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
L400784	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
L400783	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Do you really think he'll show up?
L400712	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Way to go, Evy.
L400711	u2205	m142	EVELYN	But he's just a filthy criminal?
L400706	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Picked his pocket, actually.
L400705	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
L400704	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	That just makes you more gullible.
L400703	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm your sister.
L400702	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
L400701	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You lied to me!
L400700	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I was mistaken.
L400699	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
L400693	u2205	m142	EVELYN	All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
L400692	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
L400691	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
L400687	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
L400686	u2205	m142	EVELYN	He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
L400685	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
L400682	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I think you found something.
L400681	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes?
L400680	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Jonathan?
L400676	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
L400675	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
L400673	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
L400672	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
L400671	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Right now, I only wish to join them.
L400670	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Have you no respect for the dead?
L400669	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
L400668	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You...! YOU...!
L401346	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	You have got to be joking?
L401345	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
L401298	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Got it.
L401297	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
L401296	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
L401265	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
L401264	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We gotta get her back.
L401232	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	What?
L401231	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What?
L401216	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
L401215	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
L401200	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And then he'll be coming after Evy.
L401199	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
L401198	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes, I know, I do that to people.
L401197	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
L401196	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	That looked rather painful.
L401139	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
L401138	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Who's here!?
L401063	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
L401062	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
L401044	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
L401043	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
L401035	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
L401034	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	You did not!?... We're not!?
L401029	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
L401028	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	What are you going to do? Shoot him?
L401027	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Where's my gun?
L401015	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
L401014	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Tough break.
L400944	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
L400943	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
L400929	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
L400928	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
L400922	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
L400921	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
L400920	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	None taken.
L400902	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And it stinks to high heaven in here.
L400901	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
L400893	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Be nice. That thing saved my life.
L400892	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	That thing gives me the creeps.
L400860	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Awfully.
L400859	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
L400858	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
L400857	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
L400800	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I only gamble with my life, never my money.
L400799	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
L400727	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Um, well, you see...
L400726	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Hey,... don't I know you?
L400716	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
L400715	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	She's my sister, actually.
L406493	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
L406492	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
L406490	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
L406489	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
L406488	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
L406487	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
L406486	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
L406485	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
L406484	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
L406571	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
L406570	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
L406569	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
L406568	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
L406567	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	What do you think Napoleon will do?
L406566	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
L406565	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Proceed.
L406564	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
L406563	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
L406562	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
L406561	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
L406560	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
L406559	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
L406557	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
L406556	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Ah, yes -- proceed.
L406555	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
L406554	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
L406553	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
L406552	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
L406551	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
L406550	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
L406549	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
L406548	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
L406547	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
L406546	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
L406545	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
L406544	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Proceed.
L406543	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
L406542	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
L406541	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
L406540	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
L406539	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
L406538	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
L406537	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
L406385	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
L406384	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What do you mean?
L406383	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
L406382	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	"Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. ""Berthier sees only what is in the open,"" Murat said.  ""But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest.""  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment."
L406381	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
L406380	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
L406373	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
L406372	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Whatever suggested the idea to you?
L406371	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm glad you like it.
L406370	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I think it's absolutely charming.
L406369	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah -- you approve?
L406368	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	And, what a delightful idea!
L406367	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
L405993	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
L405992	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Our lives, the revolution, my career?
L405991	u2225	m144	BARRAS	You realize what is at stake?
L405990	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm not insulted.
L405989	u2225	m144	BARRAS	I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
L405988	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Fair enough.
L405987	u2225	m144	BARRAS	In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
L405986	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
L405985	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
L405984	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
L405983	u2225	m144	BARRAS	These are odds of 8 to 1.
L405982	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Properly arranged, yes.
L405981	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
L405980	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You could have them here by daybreak.
L405979	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
L405978	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Where are they?
L405977	u2225	m144	BARRAS	There are none here.
L405976	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Any cannon?
L405975	u2225	m144	BARRAS	The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
L405974	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Cavalry?
L405973	u2225	m144	BARRAS	About 5,000 troops.
L405972	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What forces do you have at your disposal?
L405971	u2225	m144	BARRAS	I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
L405970	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Are you serious?
L405969	u2225	m144	BARRAS	To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
L405968	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What do you have in mind?
L405967	u2225	m144	BARRAS	We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
L405966	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Things are quite serious, I should say.
L405965	u2225	m144	BARRAS	I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
L405964	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, thank you.
L405963	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
L405962	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
L405961	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
L405934	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	May I come to the map?
L405933	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Please...
L405932	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
L405931	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
L405930	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I did, sir.
L405929	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Yes -- who spoke up?
L406618	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
L406617	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
L406616	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And where is Joseph?
L406615	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I don't know, sire.
L406614	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
L406613	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
L406612	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But who made this treaty?
L406611	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
L406610	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
L406609	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
L406605	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
L406604	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
L406603	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	Unhappily, it is true, sire.
L406602	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
L406601	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
L406600	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And who is defending Paris?
L406599	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	It is on this road, sire, following me.
L406598	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And where is the army?
L406597	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
L406596	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
L406706	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
L406705	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	No, sire... I was asleep.
L406704	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
L406703	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	Yes, sire?
L406702	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
L406701	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	Bertrand, sire.
L406700	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Who is there?
L406641	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
L406640	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
L406639	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
L406638	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	That is incredible.
L406637	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
L406636	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
L406635	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
L406634	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	It is a terrible shock.
L406633	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
L406173	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Let me see it.
L406172	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
L406171	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406170	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
L406169	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come back in an hour.
L406168	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	General Bonaparte?
L406107	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, shit, that's not right.
L406106	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
L406105	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Read it back.
L406079	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You may go, Captain Charles.
L406078	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
L406077	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
L406076	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Thank you, sir.
L406075	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
L406074	u2230	m144	CHARLES	No, sir, none at all.
L406073	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
L406072	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir.
L406071	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Was the trip normal in every respect?
L406070	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir.
L406069	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
L406068	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir, I am.
L406067	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
L406066	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
L406065	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
L405954	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I see...
L405953	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
L405952	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
L405951	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah-hh, no.
L405950	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
L405949	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
L405948	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
L405947	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, they're living in Nice now.
L405946	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
L405945	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I haven't been there for three years.
L405944	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Have you been back recently?
L405943	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ajaccio.
L405942	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Bastia -- and you?
L405941	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh -- where do you come from?
L405940	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
L405939	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, I am.
L405938	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
L405937	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A glass of champagne, please.
L405936	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Yes, sir?
L406587	u2247	m144	PICART	My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
L406586	u2232	m144	DIDIER	When you eat him, may I have some?
L406585	u2247	m144	PICART	His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
L406584	u2232	m144	DIDIER	Why are you carrying the dog?
L406583	u2247	m144	PICART	Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
L406582	u2232	m144	DIDIER	Hello there, Picart.
L406536	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
L406535	u2233	m144	DUROC	From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
L406534	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
L406533	u2233	m144	DUROC	We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
L406532	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Impossible, I don't believe it.
L406531	u2233	m144	DUROC	Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
L406530	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
L406529	u2233	m144	DUROC	It is the work of incendiaries.
L406528	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How did it spread so quickly?
L406527	u2233	m144	DUROC	At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
L406526	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Why didn't you wake me then?
L406525	u2233	m144	DUROC	The first reports came in at about ten.
L406524	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	When did it start?
L406523	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My God, what a fire!
L406522	u2233	m144	DUROC	Four o'clock.
L406521	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My God...!  What time is it?
L406428	u2233	m144	DUROC	May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
L406427	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
L406426	u2233	m144	DUROC	No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
L406425	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
L406424	u2233	m144	DUROC	Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
L406423	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	What is that?
L406422	u2233	m144	DUROC	The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
L406421	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	Oh?
L406420	u2233	m144	DUROC	I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
L406419	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
L406418	u2233	m144	DUROC	Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
L406417	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
L406416	u2233	m144	DUROC	Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
L406023	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
L406022	u2234	m144	EUGENE	My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
L406021	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
L406020	u2234	m144	EUGENE	No, sir.
L406019	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Does your mother know you have come?
L406018	u2234	m144	EUGENE	He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
L406017	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And he sent you to me?
L406016	u2234	m144	EUGENE	I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
L406015	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
L406014	u2234	m144	EUGENE	This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
L406013	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That is correct.
L406012	u2234	m144	EUGENE	I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
L406011	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I have met her.  What is your business with me?
L406010	u2234	m144	EUGENE	Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
L406009	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
L406008	u2234	m144	EUGENE	Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
L406007	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
L406359	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
L406358	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	No -- not as a rule.
L406357	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
L406356	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	Thank you, Napoleon.
L406354	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'll have the fire built up.
L406353	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	Thank you.
L406352	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Would you like some brandy?
L406351	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
L406350	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
L406349	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
L406348	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I see.
L406347	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
L406346	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh...?
L406345	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I very much doubt that he will.
L406344	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Will Alexander be joining us soon?
L406343	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	Yes -- an excellent idea.
L406342	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Shall we move closer to the fire?
L406341	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
L406340	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
L406339	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
L406338	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
L405901	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, yes... of course.
L405900	u2237	m144	GIRL	Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
L405899	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
L405898	u2237	m144	GIRL	Lisette La Croix.
L405897	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Only Lisette?
L405896	u2237	m144	GIRL	Lisette.
L405895	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What's your name?
L405894	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, I'm sorry about that.
L405893	u2237	m144	GIRL	Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
L405892	u2237	m144	GIRL	Do you have three francs, sir?
L405891	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
L405890	u2237	m144	GIRL	Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
L405889	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
L405888	u2237	m144	GIRL	Is it a nice warm room, sir?
L405887	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
L405886	u2237	m144	GIRL	Are you staying with a friend, sir?
L405885	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
L405884	u2237	m144	GIRL	One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
L405883	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
L405882	u2237	m144	GIRL	Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
L405881	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Then what brings you out on such a night?
L405880	u2237	m144	GIRL	Yes, I am, sir.
L405879	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
L405878	u2237	m144	GIRL	Yes, it must be.
L405877	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
L405876	u2237	m144	GIRL	The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
L405875	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Good evening, Mademoiselle.
L405874	u2237	m144	GIRL	Good evening, sir.
L406251	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
L406250	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Will you use the troops?
L406199	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
L406198	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
L406197	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
L406196	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	When is she supposed to return?
L406195	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, you shall see.
L406194	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
L406193	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Are you trying to insult me?
L406192	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
L406191	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
L406190	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
L406189	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
L406188	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	You must not act impetuously.
L406187	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
L406186	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
L406185	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I know of no better time.
L406184	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
L406183	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
L406092	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And you, Junot?
L406091	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
L406090	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
L406089	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
L406088	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Not even the slightest hint of something?
L406087	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	No... nothing at all.
L406084	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Junot?
L406083	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	No...
L406082	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
L406081	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
L406080	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
L406470	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
L406469	u2243	m144	MONTESQUIOU	And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
L406468	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, that is good.
L406467	u2243	m144	MONTESQUIOU	I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
L406466	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
L406465	u2243	m144	MONTESQUIOU	I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
L406464	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
L406331	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
L406330	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
L406329	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
L406328	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
L406325	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	It's me.
L406324	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Who is it?
L406323	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
L406322	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
L406321	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	But you will not... be safe...
L406320	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.
L406319	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Separate bedrooms?
L406311	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Goodbye.
L406310	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Five minutes.
L406309	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes!!
L406308	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Five minutes.
L406307	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
L406306	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Will you be joining us, soon?
L406305	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
L406304	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	What are you doing in there?
L406303	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
L406302	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Where is Madame Trillaud?
L406301	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
L406300	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	I know what you're doing in there.
L406299	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Go away -- I'm busy.
L406298	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Open the door.  It's me.
L406297	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes -- what is it?
L406230	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	You are my old friend.
L406229	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	All right -- I promise.
L406228	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
L406227	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Promises mean nothing.
L406226	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Promise.
L406225	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I don't understand you.
L406224	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
L406223	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I will never forgive you.
L406222	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Promise me.
L406221	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I cannot promise you that.
L406220	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Promise me you will never leave me.
L406219	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
L406218	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	She must have been in love with you.
L406217	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
L406216	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were any of them married?
L406215	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	One had better legs.
L406214	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were any of them prettier than I am?
L406213	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.
L406212	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were they pretty?
L406211	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No.
L406210	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were you in love with any of them?
L406209	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Of course.
L406208	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	But you have had mistresses while you were away.
L406207	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No.
L406206	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	And you, are you in love with any one else?
L406205	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Yes.
L406204	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Do you expect me to believe that?
L406203	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
L406202	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And now?
L406201	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	I thought I was.  I was confused.
L406200	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Were you in love with him?
L406045	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
L406044	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
L406043	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
L406040	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
L406039	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
L406038	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
L406035	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
L406034	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
L406033	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
L406032	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
L406031	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	May I offer you a drink?
L406030	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
L406029	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
L406028	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
L406027	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
L406167	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
L406166	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
L406165	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
L406164	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes, of course.  What do you want?
L406163	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Can you give me a drink, please?
L406162	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
L406161	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How did you know it was Captain Charles?
L406160	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes.
L406159	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You mean you heard them making love?
L406158	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes.
L406157	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You could hear them?
L406155	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes?
L406154	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
L406153	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How do you know?
L406152	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I know.
L406151	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How do you know?
L406150	u2240	m144	JUNOT	God help me -- yes.
L406149	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Do you know what you're saying?
L406148	u2240	m144	JUNOT	My God, what do you think?
L406147	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What was there to tell?
L406146	u2240	m144	JUNOT	About Hippolyte Charles.
L406145	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You couldn't face telling me what?
L406144	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I couldn't face telling you.
L406143	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You wrote it.
L406142	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes, I wrote it.
L406141	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What?
L406140	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I wrote it.
L406139	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.
L406138	u2240	m144	JUNOT	You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
L406137	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
L406136	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
L406135	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What the hell is the matter with you?
L406134	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
L406133	u2240	m144	JUNOT	There are some things... better left unsaid.
L406132	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
L406131	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
L406130	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
L406129	u2240	m144	JUNOT	That's all I can say.
L406128	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
L406127	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Nothing.  That's all I can say.
L406126	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What are you talking about?
L406125	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
L406124	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Why not?
L406123	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
L406122	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Certainly.
L406121	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
L406120	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
L406119	u2240	m144	JUNOT	He's downstairs -- somewhere.
L406118	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
L406117	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
L406116	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
L406115	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
L406114	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Why did you give it to him?
L406113	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
L406112	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
L406111	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
L406110	u2240	m144	JUNOT	There's probably some explanation.
L406109	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
L406104	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
L406103	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I believe you sent for me.
L406086	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
L406085	u2240	m144	JUNOT	No, one cannot simply ignore it.
L406481	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
L406480	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
L406479	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
L406478	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
L406477	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
L406476	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
L406475	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
L406474	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
L406460	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
L406459	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	No.
L406458	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
L406457	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
L406456	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
L406455	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
L406454	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
L406453	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
L406452	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
L406451	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
L406450	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
L406449	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
L406448	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
L406447	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
L406446	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
L406445	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Of course, my dear.
L406444	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
L406443	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, I do -- very much.
L406442	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Do you like music?
L406440	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
L406439	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
L406437	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
L406436	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	And, where did you see my portrait?
L406434	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
L406433	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Oh, then you are...
L406432	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
L406408	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
L406407	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
L406406	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That is a matter of opinion.
L406405	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
L406404	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
L406403	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	And where do you place Alexander?
L406402	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
L406401	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	What I am talking about is moderation.
L406400	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
L406399	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
L406398	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	We have a treaty with Austria.
L406397	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
L406396	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
L406395	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
L406394	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That is correct.
L406393	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	"Now, the section headed ""Secret Clauses of the Treaty"" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade."
L406392	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, he has.
L406391	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Has Alexander agreed to this?
L406390	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I did not ask her to go to war against me.
L406389	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Those are extremely harsh terms.
L406388	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Does she deserve anything better?
L406387	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
L405915	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
L405914	u2251	m144	VARLAC	I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
L405912	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
L405911	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
L405910	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
L405909	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
L405908	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
L405907	u2251	m144	VARLAC	A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
L405905	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
L405904	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
L405903	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
L406262	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Send him in.
L406261	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
L406260	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406255	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Let me have it.
L406254	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	A message from Citizen Fouche.
L406253	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406247	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Send him in.
L406246	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Major Lavallette to see you, General.
L406245	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406005	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Show him in.
L406004	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Yes, sir.
L406003	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Is he alone?
L406002	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Eugene de Beauharnais.
L406001	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What did you say his name was?
L406589	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
L406588	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
L406506	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
L406505	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
L406362	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
L406361	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
L406281	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
L406280	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	"On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  ""I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."""
L406062	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
L406061	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
L405873	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
L405872	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
L405871	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
L405870	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	His moods at this time were complex and varied.
L405854	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
L405853	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
L426158	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
L426157	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
L426151	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
L426150	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Our pleasure, Big Dan.
L426149	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
L426133	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
L426132	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
L426131	u2390	m153	BIG DAN	I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
L426489	u2391	m153	COOLEY	The law. Well the law is a human institution.
L426488	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It ain't the law!
L426482	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
L426481	u2391	m153	COOLEY	- and share one of your graves.
L426480	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hang on there -
L426479	u2391	m153	COOLEY	Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
L426478	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You can't do this -
L426477	u2391	m153	COOLEY	You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
L426476	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Waitaminute -
L426475	u2391	m153	COOLEY	- but now it deposits you here.
L426474	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Waitaminute -
L426473	u2391	m153	COOLEY	End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
L426493	u2401	m153	PETE	Good Lord, what do we do?
L426492	u2392	m153	DELMAR	I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
L426326	u2401	m153	PETE	Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
L426325	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Huh?!
L426324	u2401	m153	PETE	Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
L426323	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
L426322	u2401	m153	PETE	No, they never did turn me into a toad.
L426321	u2392	m153	DELMAR	We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
L426280	u2401	m153	PETE	Do not seek the treasure!
L426279	u2392	m153	DELMAR	...Pete?
L426005	u2401	m153	PETE	What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
L426004	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
L425992	u2401	m153	PETE	Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
L425991	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
L425975	u2401	m153	PETE	All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
L425974	u2392	m153	DELMAR	That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
L425973	u2401	m153	PETE	That's right!
L425911	u2401	m153	PETE	You mis'able little sneak thief...
L425910	u2392	m153	DELMAR	You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
L425903	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Gopher, Everett?
L425902	u2401	m153	PETE	We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
L425840	u2401	m153	PETE	How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
L425839	u2392	m153	DELMAR	'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
L426500	u2392	m153	DELMAR	That ain't it!
L426499	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
L426498	u2392	m153	DELMAR	A miracle! It was a miracle!
L426464	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
L426463	u2392	m153	DELMAR	We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
L426452	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
L426451	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
L426447	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Oh, okay.
L426446	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
L426445	u2392	m153	DELMAR	What sat mean exactly, Everett?
L426403	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Everett, my beard itches.
L426402	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
L426396	u2394	m153	EVERETT	He was never turned into a frog!
L426395	u2392	m153	DELMAR	'N turned into a frog -
L426354	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Oh my God!
L426353	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
L426346	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
L426345	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
L426339	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
L426338	u2392	m153	DELMAR	So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
L426274	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
L426273	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
L426272	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
L426271	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
L426270	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
L426269	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Okay, Everett.
L426268	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
L426192	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Not that I'm aware.
L426191	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete have a brother?
L426135	u2394	m153	EVERETT	We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
L426134	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Uh, we uh-
L426122	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
L426121	u2392	m153	DELMAR	I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
L426120	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
L426117	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
L426116	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...I'm not sure that's Pete.
L426113	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
L426112	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
L426109	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
L426108	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Whuhh...
L426073	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
L426072	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
L426021	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
L426020	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Yeah, look at me.
L426016	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Where's Tommy?
L426015	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
L426014	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
L426013	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
L426000	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
L425999	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Izzat right?
L425998	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Four hundred, Delmar.
L425997	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
L425954	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
L425953	u2392	m153	DELMAR	This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
L425945	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
L425944	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
L425941	u2392	m153	DELMAR	You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
L425940	u2394	m153	EVERETT	That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
L425939	u2392	m153	DELMAR	But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
L425935	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
L425934	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
L425933	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
L425932	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
L425931	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
L425898	u2394	m153	EVERETT	And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
L425897	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Gopher, Everett?
L425896	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
L425874	u2392	m153	DELMAR	Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
L425873	u2394	m153	EVERETT	NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
L425871	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Fire! I hate fire!
L425870	u2392	m153	DELMAR	What do we do now, Everett?
L425825	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
L425824	u2392	m153	DELMAR	How'd he know about the treasure?
L426391	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
L426390	u2399	m153	PAPPY	You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
L426384	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Campaign manager? Waldrip.
L426383	u2399	m153	PAPPY	What's his name again?
L426375	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Assa good idea, Pappy.
L426374	u2399	m153	PAPPY	I'm sayin' we har this man away.
L426302	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Problem a p'seption.
L426301	u2399	m153	PAPPY	Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
L426147	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Okay, Pappy.
L426146	u2399	m153	PAPPY	I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
L425988	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
L425987	u2399	m153	PAPPY	We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!

L426417	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Not out the other side his face, though.
L426416	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
L426386	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Vernon T. Waldrip.
L426385	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Vernon Waldrip.
L426382	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Powas p'suasion.
L426381	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
L426380	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
L426379	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
L426378	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
L426377	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
L426376	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Helluva idea.
L426312	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Wipin' little circles with his bread...
L426311	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Pullin' ah pants down...
L426310	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
L426309	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Well, that's how I characterize it.
L426308	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
L426307	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
L426306	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
L426305	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
L426304	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
L426303	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Ass right.
L426297	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Helluva awgazation.
L426296	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Devil his due.
L426295	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
L426294	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Suckin' away.
L426293	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Wipin' little circles with his bread.
L426292	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Latch right on to that tit.
L426291	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
L426290	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Gonna pluck us off the tit.

L425983	u2403	m153	SPIVEY	In any state.
L425982	u2393	m153	ECKARD	Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
L426536	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well sure, honey, but...
L426535	u2400	m153	PENNY	I counted to three, honey.
L426533	u2400	m153	PENNY	That wasn't my doing...
L426532	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Yes, but honey -
L426531	u2400	m153	PENNY	I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
L426530	u2394	m153	EVERETT	A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
L426529	u2400	m153	PENNY	Uh-huh.
L426528	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
L426527	u2400	m153	PENNY	Well, we need that ring.
L426526	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, I'm sorry honey -
L426525	u2400	m153	PENNY	Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
L426524	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You -
L426523	u2400	m153	PENNY	Or, it might a been under the mattress.
L426522	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You said -
L426521	u2400	m153	PENNY	I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
L426520	u2394	m153	EVERETT	You said it was in the rolltop desk!
L426519	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
L426518	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Not your...
L426517	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's not my ring.
L426516	u2394	m153	EVERETT	- in the gods - Huh?
L426515	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's not my ring.
L426514	u2394	m153	EVERETT	And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
L426513	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's good, honey.
L426512	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
L426511	u2394	m153	EVERETT	But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
L426510	u2400	m153	PENNY	That's right, honey.
L426509	u2394	m153	EVERETT	All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
L426462	u2400	m153	PENNY	No weddin'.
L426461	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It's just a symbol, honey -
L426460	u2400	m153	PENNY	Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
L426459	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
L426458	u2400	m153	PENNY	We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
L426457	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
L426456	u2400	m153	PENNY	I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
L426455	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Where's your ring, honey?
L426454	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
L426453	u2400	m153	PENNY	McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
L426262	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
L426261	u2400	m153	PENNY	I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
L426260	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
L426259	u2400	m153	PENNY	No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
L426258	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Now Penny, stop that!
L426257	u2400	m153	PENNY	That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
L426504	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
L426503	u2401	m153	PETE	That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
L426502	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
L426501	u2401	m153	PETE	We prayed to God and he pitied us!
L426405	u2394	m153	EVERETT	No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
L426404	u2401	m153	PETE	This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
L426394	u2401	m153	PETE	Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
L426393	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
L426351	u2401	m153	PETE	Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
L426350	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete... I do apologize.
L426344	u2401	m153	PETE	...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
L426343	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
L426342	u2401	m153	PETE	...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
L426341	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
L426340	u2401	m153	PETE	But...
L426337	u2401	m153	PETE	But... but...
L426336	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Fact of the matter - there never was!
L426334	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, but Pete...
L426333	u2401	m153	PETE	I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
L426332	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
L426329	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Aw, that's all right.
L426328	u2401	m153	PETE	It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
L426320	u2394	m153	EVERETT	I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
L426319	u2401	m153	PETE	They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
L426318	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
L426317	u2401	m153	PETE	It was a moment a weakness!
L426029	u2394	m153	EVERETT	...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
L426028	u2401	m153	PETE	...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
L426026	u2401	m153	PETE	Isn't it, uh...
L426025	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
L426019	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
L426018	u2401	m153	PETE	The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
L426007	u2401	m153	PETE	Well that hardly sounds like you...
L426006	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
L426003	u2394	m153	EVERETT	What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
L426002	u2401	m153	PETE	An' all my meals for free...
L425996	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Million point two.
L425995	u2401	m153	PETE	A million dollars.
L425943	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
L425942	u2401	m153	PETE	Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
L425938	u2394	m153	EVERETT	For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
L425937	u2401	m153	PETE	The preacher said it absolved us.
L425930	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, don't be ignorant-
L425929	u2401	m153	PETE	Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
L425917	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
L425916	u2401	m153	PETE	That don't make no sense!
L425915	u2394	m153	EVERETT	So I borrowed it till I did know!
L425914	u2401	m153	PETE	You didn't know that at the time!
L425913	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Who was fixing to betray us!
L425909	u2394	m153	EVERETT	It was in his bureau.
L425908	u2401	m153	PETE	To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
L425907	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
L425906	u2401	m153	PETE	How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
L425901	u2401	m153	PETE	We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
L425900	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Don't I know it.
L425899	u2401	m153	PETE	Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
L425876	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
L425875	u2401	m153	PETE	YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
L425863	u2401	m153	PETE	The hell you say! Wash is kin!
L425862	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
L425810	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
L425809	u2401	m153	PETE	Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
L425808	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
L425807	u2401	m153	PETE	Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
L425894	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!
L425893	u2402	m153	PROPRIETOR	Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
L425892	u2394	m153	EVERETT	No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
L425891	u2402	m153	PROPRIETOR	I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
L425890	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
L425889	u2402	m153	PROPRIETOR	Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
L425888	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
L425978	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
L425977	u2397	m153	MAN	Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
L425976	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
L425972	u2394	m153	EVERETT	Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
L425971	u2397	m153	MAN	Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-

L426089	u2397	m153	MAN	Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
L426088	u2395	m153	FRENCH	Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
L426087	u2397	m153	MAN	It was a powerful air.
L426086	u2395	m153	FRENCH	Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
L426085	u2397	m153	MAN	Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
L426084	u2395	m153	FRENCH	They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
L426083	u2397	m153	MAN	Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
L426082	u2395	m153	FRENCH	How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
L426081	u2397	m153	MAN	Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
L426422	u2399	m153	PAPPY	Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
L426421	u2396	m153	JUNIOR	But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
L426420	u2399	m153	PAPPY	Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
L426287	u2399	m153	PAPPY	We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
L426286	u2396	m153	JUNIOR	We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
L426285	u2399	m153	PAPPY	I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
L426142	u2396	m153	JUNIOR	Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
L426141	u2399	m153	PAPPY	...Yeah?
L426140	u2396	m153	JUNIOR	Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
L426139	u2399	m153	PAPPY	Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
L426240	u2404	m153	YOUNGEST	Buyin' nipples!
L426239	u2398	m153	MIDDLE	She's at the five and dime.
L426229	u2398	m153	MIDDLE	He's a suitor!
L426228	u2404	m153	YOUNGEST	It's bona fide!
L426217	u2404	m153	YOUNGEST	You got a maiden name, Daddy?
L426216	u2398	m153	MIDDLE	That's a maiden name.
L426211	u2404	m153	YOUNGEST	Blooey!
L426210	u2398	m153	MIDDLE	Mama said you was hit by a train!
L426206	u2398	m153	MIDDLE	He ain't our daddy!
L426205	u2404	m153	YOUNGEST	Daddy!
L442427	u2470	m159	JACK	Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
L442426	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	Aye, aye, sir!
L442425	u2470	m159	JACK	AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
L442088	u2470	m159	JACK	They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
L442087	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	How does he do that?
L442020	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	I will.
L442019	u2470	m159	JACK	You'll get it back.  Or one better.
L442018	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	That boat is my livelihood!
L442017	u2470	m159	JACK	Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
L442016	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
L442014	u2470	m159	JACK	AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
L442013	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	You stole my boat.
L442403	u2476	m159	WILL	He didn't waste it.
L442402	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
L442214	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
L442213	u2476	m159	WILL	No!  You gave your word!
L442208	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
L442207	u2476	m159	WILL	You must swear by the Holy Bible.
L442204	u2476	m159	WILL	And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
L442203	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	We got that part.  Anything else?
L442202	u2476	m159	WILL	Elizabeth goes free!
L442201	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Enough of that!  Name your terms.
L442194	u2476	m159	WILL	You can't.  I can.
L442193	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
L442192	u2476	m159	WILL	She.  Goes.  Free.
L442191	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	What's in your head, boy?
L442400	u2470	m159	JACK	Or you could surrender.
L442399	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
L442394	u2470	m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L442393	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
L442375	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Aye, for us there is.
L442374	u2470	m159	JACK	There's ... another exit?
L442372	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Men!  Are you up for it?
L442371	u2470	m159	JACK	Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
L442369	u2470	m159	JACK	Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
L442368	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That so?
L442367	u2470	m159	JACK	The situation has changed.
L442366	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
L442365	u2470	m159	JACK	Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
L442363	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	What're you suggesting?
L442362	u2470	m159	JACK	You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
L442357	u2470	m159	JACK	Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
L442356	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Why don't I want to do this?
L442355	u2470	m159	JACK	All right then.
L442354	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No, I really think I do.
L442226	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That's fair.
L442225	u2470	m159	JACK	You can go to your grave not knowing.
L442224	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	So how did you get off that island, anyway?
L442219	u2470	m159	JACK	The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
L442218	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You'd best take a swim, Jack.
L442217	u2470	m159	JACK	Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
L442216	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
L442215	u2470	m159	JACK	It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
L442164	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
L442163	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll watch my back.
L442162	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
L442161	u2470	m159	JACK	What -- you don't have the medallion?
L442159	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
L442158	u2470	m159	JACK	See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
L442157	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
L442155	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Track you down and --
L442154	u2470	m159	JACK	Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
L442153	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
L442152	u2470	m159	JACK	Wait as long as you like.
L442151	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
L442150	u2470	m159	JACK	You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
L442149	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I'll torture it out of you.
L442148	u2470	m159	JACK	You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
L442146	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I'm supposed to ... trust you?
L442145	u2470	m159	JACK	That's right.
L442144	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
L442143	u2470	m159	JACK	You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
L442142	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
L442141	u2470	m159	JACK	Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
L442140	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
L442137	u2470	m159	JACK	No you won't.
L442136	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Say the name, or I slit your throat.
L442135	u2470	m159	JACK	I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
L442361	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
L442360	u2474	m159	PINTEL	Do you believe him?
L442339	u2474	m159	PINTEL	I guess there is a reason to fret.
L442338	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
L442337	u2474	m159	PINTEL	No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
L442221	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
L442220	u2474	m159	PINTEL	That's proper, sir, according to the code.
L442200	u2474	m159	PINTEL	And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
L442199	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
L442139	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now.  No, don't kill him.
L442138	u2474	m159	PINTEL	Now?
L442206	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Will -- you can't trust him.
L442205	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
L442090	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
L442089	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	The curse drove you to gather this?
L441974	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
L441973	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It's a pirate medallion.
L441972	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Do you not know what this is, then?
L441971	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Would that I could.
L441970	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Then why aren't you eating?
L441969	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
L441964	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
L441963	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
L441962	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Maid or not, it fits you.
L441862	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
L441861	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Can I trust you?
L441860	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
L441859	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
L441858	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
L441857	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Thank you, sir.
L441856	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You've got sand, for a maid.
L441855	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
L441854	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You have a name, missy?
L441851	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Did you, now?
L441850	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
L441849	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
L441848	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I'll drop it!
L441847	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Very well.
L441846	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
L441845	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I want you to leave.  And never come back.
L441844	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
L441843	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
L441842	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
L442309	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
L442308	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	That would hardly be proper.
L442307	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Then I can wear men's clothing.
L442306	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
L442304	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I know where your heart truly lies.
L442303	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What?
L442302	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
L442299	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Not as a condition -- a request.
L442298	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
L442297	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
L442294	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, please!
L442293	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
L442292	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	No.  The pirates have taken Will --
L442289	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
L442288	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You're speaking up for him again?
L442287	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, you can't do that!
L442286	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
L441758	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
L441757	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
L441744	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
L441743	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
L441712	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I'm a bit nervous, myself --
L441711	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I can't breathe.
L441710	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
L441623	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Very good.
L441622	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
L441621	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Did he speak?
L441607	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
L441606	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Boy overboard!
L441605	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Man overboard!
L441597	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
L441596	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
L441650	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	About the day we met. Do you remember?
L441649	u2475	m159	SWANN	Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
L441638	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
L441637	u2475	m159	SWANN	I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
L441636	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Difficult ... to say.
L441634	u2475	m159	SWANN	Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
L441633	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I knew it.
L441632	u2475	m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
L441631	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Ceremony?
L441630	u2475	m159	SWANN	Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
L441629	u2475	m159	SWANN	Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
L441628	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
L441625	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes -- yes.
L441624	u2475	m159	SWANN	Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
L441602	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, father.
L441601	u2475	m159	SWANN	And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
L441600	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Actually, I find it all fascinating.
L441960	u2474	m159	PINTEL	He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
L441959	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
L441958	u2474	m159	PINTEL	You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
L441819	u2474	m159	PINTEL	It would appear, so do you.
L441818	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
L441817	u2474	m159	PINTEL	I know the code.
L441816	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
L441815	u2474	m159	PINTEL	What?
L442413	u2476	m159	WILL	-- but that was not a proper kiss.
L442412	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It doesn't!
L442411	u2476	m159	WILL	Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
L442410	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
L442172	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
L442171	u2476	m159	WILL	I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
L442170	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	-- then we never would have met.
L442169	u2476	m159	WILL	If I had known --
L442168	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
L442167	u2476	m159	WILL	Why would my father send this to me?
L442123	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
L442122	u2476	m159	WILL	I'm glad we got here in time.
L441653	u2476	m159	WILL	At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
L441652	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
L441651	u2476	m159	WILL	I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
L442324	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What's your plan?
L442323	u2470	m159	JACK	I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
L442322	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
L442321	u2470	m159	JACK	Exactly.
L442320	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
L442319	u2470	m159	JACK	Nor did you, I noticed.
L442318	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
L442283	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Exactly.
L442282	u2470	m159	JACK	You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
L442281	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
L442280	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
L442279	u2470	m159	JACK	Why?
L442278	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, the rum is gone.
L442277	u2470	m159	JACK	What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
L442276	u2470	m159	JACK	To the Black Pearl.
L442275	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	To freedom.
L442274	u2470	m159	JACK	We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
L442273	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
L442272	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
L442271	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
L442269	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
L442268	u2470	m159	JACK	When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
L442262	u2470	m159	JACK	More to drink!
L442261	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
L442260	u2470	m159	JACK	Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
L442259	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	That was before I met one, of course.
L442258	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
L442257	u2470	m159	JACK	I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
L442256	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
L442255	u2470	m159	JACK	What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
L442254	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
L442251	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Not when you can drink instead, at least.
L442250	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
L442249	u2470	m159	JACK	You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
L442248	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
L442247	u2470	m159	JACK	You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
L442246	u2470	m159	JACK	Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
L442245	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
L442244	u2470	m159	JACK	Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
L442243	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	But ... you did it before!  Last time --
L442242	u2470	m159	JACK	It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
L442241	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
L442239	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
L442238	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
L442235	u2470	m159	JACK	The trees are taller.
L442234	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Has it changed since the last time you were here?
L442126	u2470	m159	JACK	No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
L442125	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Come on!
L442118	u2470	m159	JACK	No, I'm -- rescuing you.
L442117	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You're in league with Barbossa!
L442116	u2470	m159	JACK	Me!
L442115	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You?!
L441755	u2470	m159	JACK	I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
L441754	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You are despicable.
L441752	u2470	m159	JACK	Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
L441751	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Miss Swann.
L442078	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
L442077	u2468	m159	GIBBS	How did you get off the island?
L442059	u2470	m159	JACK	We're catching up!
L442058	u2468	m159	GIBBS	What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
L442057	u2470	m159	JACK	She can hold a bit longer.
L442056	u2468	m159	GIBBS	We'd best drop canvas, sir!
L442044	u2470	m159	JACK	That he is.
L442043	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
L442040	u2468	m159	GIBBS	And you've got that, have you?
L442039	u2470	m159	JACK	Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
L442038	u2468	m159	GIBBS	A fool's errand.
L442037	u2470	m159	JACK	Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
L442036	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
L442035	u2470	m159	JACK	I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
L442034	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Say again?
L442032	u2470	m159	JACK	Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
L442031	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
L442030	u2470	m159	JACK	First -- have you found me a crew?
L442029	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
L442025	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Aye, that'll about do it.
L442024	u2470	m159	JACK	Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
L442023	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
L442188	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
L442187	u2476	m159	WILL	We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
L442186	u2468	m159	GIBBS	That we are.
L442185	u2476	m159	WILL	We're not going to just surrender!
L442184	u2468	m159	GIBBS	It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
L442074	u2476	m159	WILL	How did he get off the island?
L442073	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
L442072	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
L442071	u2476	m159	WILL	What?  He never told me that.
L442070	u2468	m159	GIBBS	I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
L442069	u2476	m159	WILL	Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
L442068	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
L442067	u2476	m159	WILL	How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
L442027	u2476	m159	WILL	I know.  That was for the smell.
L442026	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Blast it, I'm already awake!
L442422	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I don't think that will be necessary.
L442421	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
L442384	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
L442383	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
L441952	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
L441951	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
L441950	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
L441949	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
L441948	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Raise the sails.
L441927	u2470	m159	JACK	As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
L441926	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
L441925	u2470	m159	JACK	Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
L441924	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
L441923	u2470	m159	JACK	We'll see about that.
L441922	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
L441921	u2470	m159	JACK	Dead serious.
L441702	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	I said, no lies.
L441701	u2470	m159	JACK	None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
L441698	u2470	m159	JACK	Smith.
L441697	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	What's your name?
L441676	u2470	m159	JACK	That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
L441675	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
L441674	u2470	m159	JACK	That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
L441668	u2470	m159	JACK	This must be some important boat.
L441667	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
L441666	u2470	m159	JACK	Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
L441665	u2470	m159	JACK	Sorry, I didn't know.
L441664	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	This dock is off-limits to civilians.
L442336	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
L442335	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I'll be at the wheel myself.
L442334	u2470	m159	JACK	That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
L442333	u2470	m159	JACK	I knew you'd listen to reason!
L442332	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
L442331	u2470	m159	JACK	They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
L442330	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You would do that?
L442329	u2470	m159	JACK	Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
L442328	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
L442296	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
L442295	u2470	m159	JACK	Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
L442291	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
L442290	u2470	m159	JACK	We had time to get to know each other.
L441746	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Indeed.
L441745	u2470	m159	JACK	But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
L441741	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, but you have heard of me.
L441740	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
L441733	u2470	m159	JACK	Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
L441732	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
L442405	u2470	m159	JACK	The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
L442404	u2476	m159	WILL	Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
L442359	u2470	m159	JACK	-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
L442358	u2476	m159	WILL	Jack!
L442348	u2470	m159	JACK	It's the right way.
L442347	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you certain this is the right way?
L442346	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
L442345	u2476	m159	WILL	Jack!
L442344	u2470	m159	JACK	Do you have any idea where you're going?
L442197	u2476	m159	WILL	My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
L442196	u2470	m159	JACK	Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
L442131	u2470	m159	JACK	I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
L442130	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
L442129	u2470	m159	JACK	Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
L442128	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll lead them away.
L442127	u2476	m159	WILL	No.
L442121	u2470	m159	JACK	This way!
L442120	u2476	m159	WILL	Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
L442094	u2470	m159	JACK	On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
L442093	u2476	m159	WILL	On what?
L442092	u2470	m159	JACK	Depends.
L442091	u2476	m159	WILL	What's that?
L442082	u2476	m159	WILL	Barbossa.
L442081	u2470	m159	JACK	But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
L442080	u2470	m159	JACK	The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
L442079	u2476	m159	WILL	Wait -- what about the pistol?
L442054	u2470	m159	JACK	These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
L442053	u2476	m159	WILL	Shut up, before you lose them all!
L442012	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
L442011	u2476	m159	WILL	Just do it quickly.
L442009	u2470	m159	JACK	Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
L442008	u2476	m159	WILL	Tortuga?
L442005	u2470	m159	JACK	Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
L442004	u2476	m159	WILL	You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
L442003	u2470	m159	JACK	Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
L442002	u2476	m159	WILL	My father -- was not -- a pirate!
L442001	u2470	m159	JACK	Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
L442000	u2476	m159	WILL	My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
L441999	u2470	m159	JACK	You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
L441998	u2476	m159	WILL	He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
L441997	u2470	m159	JACK	Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
L441996	u2476	m159	WILL	It's not true my father was a pirate.
L441995	u2470	m159	JACK	I swear, you look just like him.
L441994	u2476	m159	WILL	That's not true.
L441993	u2470	m159	JACK	Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
L441992	u2476	m159	WILL	'Bootstrap?'
L441991	u2470	m159	JACK	I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
L441989	u2476	m159	WILL	My father.  William Turner?
L441988	u2470	m159	JACK	Is that so?
L441987	u2476	m159	WILL	I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
L441986	u2470	m159	JACK	For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
L441919	u2476	m159	WILL	Aye!  Avast!
L441918	u2470	m159	JACK	Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
L441917	u2470	m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L441916	u2476	m159	WILL	This is either crazy, or brilliant.
L441915	u2470	m159	JACK	So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
L441914	u2476	m159	WILL	It's still against the law.
L441913	u2470	m159	JACK	Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
L441912	u2476	m159	WILL	We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
L441910	u2470	m159	JACK	No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
L441909	u2476	m159	WILL	I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
L441908	u2470	m159	JACK	Come aboard.
L441905	u2470	m159	JACK	Good.
L441904	u2476	m159	WILL	I'd die for her.
L441903	u2470	m159	JACK	My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
L441902	u2476	m159	WILL	Why are brothering with that?
L441901	u2476	m159	WILL	We need to go!
L441900	u2470	m159	JACK	Not without my effects.
L441898	u2470	m159	JACK	Agreed!
L441897	u2476	m159	WILL	Agreed.
L441893	u2476	m159	WILL	I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
L441892	u2470	m159	JACK	How?  The key's run off.
L441891	u2476	m159	WILL	I can get you out of here.
L441890	u2470	m159	JACK	So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
L441889	u2476	m159	WILL	Never.  They took Miss Swann.
L441888	u2470	m159	JACK	And you want to turn pirate yourself?
L441887	u2476	m159	WILL	Because you're a pirate.
L441886	u2470	m159	JACK	Why ask me?
L441885	u2476	m159	WILL	The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
L441884	u2470	m159	JACK	Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
L441883	u2476	m159	WILL	Where does it make berth?
L441882	u2470	m159	JACK	Somewhat.
L441881	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
L441783	u2476	m159	WILL	No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
L441782	u2470	m159	JACK	Move!
L441781	u2476	m159	WILL	No.
L441780	u2470	m159	JACK	Move away.
L441779	u2470	m159	JACK	Pirate.
L441778	u2476	m159	WILL	You cheated.
L441776	u2470	m159	JACK	You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
L441775	u2476	m159	WILL	I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
L441774	u2470	m159	JACK	Who makes all these?
L441769	u2470	m159	JACK	Only a little.
L441768	u2476	m159	WILL	You threatened Miss Swann.
L441767	u2470	m159	JACK	Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
L441766	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
L441765	u2476	m159	WILL	I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
L441764	u2470	m159	JACK	You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
L441874	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Still --
L441873	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Mentioned it, is more what he did.
L441872	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
L441706	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
L441705	u2471	m159	MULLROY	He may be.
L441704	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	He's not telling the truth.
L441703	u2471	m159	MULLROY	I think he's telling the truth.
L441700	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	And no lies!
L441699	u2471	m159	MULLROY	What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
L441693	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
L441692	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	... no.
L441691	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
L441690	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	But I've seen a ship with black sails.
L441689	u2471	m159	MULLROY	No.
L441688	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	... No.
L441687	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
L441686	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes, I have.
L441685	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You haven't seen it.
L441684	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
L441683	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen the Black Pearl?
L441682	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
L441681	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen it?
L441680	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes it is.  I've seen it.
L441679	u2471	m159	MULLROY	No, it's not.
L441678	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	The Black Pearl is a real ship.
L441677	u2471	m159	MULLROY	There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
L441938	u2475	m159	SWANN	Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
L441937	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Please.
L441936	u2475	m159	SWANN	But --
L441935	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	A moment.
L441934	u2475	m159	SWANN	Commodore --
L441796	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Bleak.  Very bleak.
L441795	u2475	m159	SWANN	Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
L441794	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	No.  She hasn't.
L441793	u2475	m159	SWANN	Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
L441612	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
L441611	u2475	m159	SWANN	What happened here?
L441609	u2475	m159	SWANN	Where did he come from?
L441608	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	He's still breathing.
L441599	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	My apologies, Governor.
L441598	u2475	m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
L530025	u2871	m189	LIZ	Let me see.
L530024	u2863	m189	ADELE	Peter-- you took this picture?
L530017	u2871	m189	LIZ	Be nice.
L530016	u2863	m189	ADELE	And Flash isn't?
L530011	u2863	m189	ADELE	At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
L530010	u2871	m189	LIZ	Well, look who's dressing for success.
L529867	u2871	m189	LIZ	Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
L529866	u2863	m189	ADELE	Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
L529862	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
L529861	u2863	m189	ADELE	Sexual tension...
L529663	u2864	m189	BEN	I'm always here, Pete.
L529662	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.
L529661	u2864	m189	BEN	When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
L529659	u2864	m189	BEN	-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
L529658	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
L529657	u2864	m189	BEN	Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
L529656	u2876	m189	PETER	No, no.
L529655	u2864	m189	BEN	Cause if you get in a bind--
L529654	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, sure.
L529653	u2864	m189	BEN	Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
L529652	u2864	m189	BEN	Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
L529651	u2876	m189	PETER	Remember Little League?
L529650	u2864	m189	BEN	S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
L529649	u2876	m189	PETER	No?not really.
L529648	u2864	m189	BEN	Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
L529647	u2864	m189	BEN	Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
L529646	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
L529645	u2864	m189	BEN	Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
L529644	u2876	m189	PETER	You stop him?
L529643	u2864	m189	BEN	Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
L529642	u2876	m189	PETER	Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
L529641	u2864	m189	BEN	So, uh... how's college goin'?
L529640	u2876	m189	PETER	No. No, that's okay.
L529639	u2864	m189	BEN	What, want a glass?
L529638	u2876	m189	PETER	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
L529637	u2864	m189	BEN	Here you go, Pete.
L530253	u2866	m189	HARRY	Or was it all a dream?
L530252	u2865	m189	FLASH	See?
L530251	u2866	m189	HARRY	I was there.
L530021	u2865	m189	FLASH	-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
L530020	u2866	m189	HARRY	Flash, drop it--
L530019	u2865	m189	FLASH	No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
L530018	u2866	m189	HARRY	Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
L530194	u2865	m189	FLASH	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
L530193	u2871	m189	LIZ	Flash, get lost.
L530029	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hm.  What a lump.
L530028	u2865	m189	FLASH	Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
L530015	u2871	m189	LIZ	I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
L530014	u2865	m189	FLASH	Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
L529590	u2865	m189	FLASH	I'm parked illegally!
L529589	u2871	m189	LIZ	I was sort of hoping to get out of--
L529588	u2865	m189	FLASH	Lizzy!
L530256	u2866	m189	HARRY	Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
L530255	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
L530254	u2866	m189	HARRY	Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
L530188	u2866	m189	HARRY	I got you a present.
L530187	u2876	m189	PETER	Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
L530186	u2866	m189	HARRY	You get mugged or something?
L530009	u2876	m189	PETER	You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
L530008	u2866	m189	HARRY	And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
L530007	u2876	m189	PETER	Mm-hmm.
L530006	u2866	m189	HARRY	Jesus Christ.
L529813	u2866	m189	HARRY	I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
L529812	u2876	m189	PETER	Don't be pitiful.
L529811	u2866	m189	HARRY	You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
L529810	u2866	m189	HARRY	Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
L529809	u2876	m189	PETER	Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
L529808	u2866	m189	HARRY	Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
L529807	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.  I've got one too.
L529806	u2866	m189	HARRY	Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times.
L529805	u2876	m189	PETER	Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
L529804	u2866	m189	HARRY	Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University.
L529803	u2876	m189	PETER	Harry?
L529802	u2866	m189	HARRY	Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
L529561	u2876	m189	PETER	Harry!
L529560	u2866	m189	HARRY	A little bunny I saved from dissection.
L529559	u2876	m189	PETER	What's in there?
L529558	u2866	m189	HARRY	They'll never take me alive.
L529557	u2876	m189	PETER	You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
L529755	u2876	m189	PETER	Right.
L529754	u2867	m189	HOGAN	You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
L529753	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
L529752	u2867	m189	HOGAN	How are you doing, kid?
L529748	u2867	m189	HOGAN	Get away from me, freak!
L529747	u2876	m189	PETER	Are you okay?
L529746	u2876	m189	PETER	That's not even close.
L529745	u2867	m189	HOGAN	Lemme down, bugface!
L529744	u2876	m189	PETER	Now tell me you love me.
L529836	u2868	m189	JAMESON	No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
L529835	u2876	m189	PETER	Can I get a word in edgewise?
L529834	u2868	m189	JAMESON	No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
L529833	u2876	m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
L529832	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
L529831	u2876	m189	PETER	You print pictures of Bigfoot!
L529830	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
L529829	u2876	m189	PETER	Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
L529828	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
L529827	u2876	m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
L529826	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
L529825	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
L529824	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
L529712	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
L529711	u2876	m189	PETER	Can't focus...
L529699	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
L529698	u2876	m189	PETER	Can we make it a hundred?
L529697	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
L529696	u2876	m189	PETER	Yeah--
L529695	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
L529694	u2876	m189	PETER	You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
L529599	u2868	m189	JAMESON	You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
L529598	u2876	m189	PETER	Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
L529595	u2876	m189	PETER	I think you're trying to tell me something.
L529594	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
L530125	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Hmf-hrr?
L530124	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
L530122	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Fine.
L530121	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Frmpph-yrr.
L530120	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
L530119	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
L530118	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Would you cool it already?
L530117	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
L530116	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
L529766	u2876	m189	PETER	Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
L529765	u2869	m189	LEIBER	An even five I throw in the jacket.
L529764	u2876	m189	PETER	Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
L529763	u2869	m189	LEIBER	You're making my life difficult.
L529762	u2876	m189	PETER	How about tomorrow?
L529761	u2869	m189	LEIBER	Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
L529760	u2876	m189	PETER	A spider.  Eight legs.
L529759	u2869	m189	LEIBER	What's this? A cockaroach?
L529758	u2876	m189	PETER	Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
L529757	u2869	m189	LEIBER	No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
L529991	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
L529990	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Are you quite finished?
L529922	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
L529921	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
L529916	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Well...
L529915	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
L529914	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thanks, I already ate.
L529913	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
L529912	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just call me Spidey.
L529911	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
L529910	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
L529909	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
L530139	u2873	m189	MAY	What if the world ends tomorrow?
L530138	u2871	m189	LIZ	What if you get hurt?
L530137	u2873	m189	MAY	Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
L530136	u2871	m189	LIZ	Even if they're not clever.
L530135	u2873	m189	MAY	Some things you should say anyway.
L530134	u2871	m189	LIZ	He knew.
L530133	u2873	m189	MAY	Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
L530128	u2871	m189	LIZ	I don't think he wants me to find him.
L530127	u2873	m189	MAY	When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
L530126	u2871	m189	LIZ	He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
L530269	u2876	m189	PETER	Nah.
L530268	u2871	m189	LIZ	This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
L530267	u2871	m189	LIZ	Why?
L530266	u2876	m189	PETER	Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
L530265	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
L530264	u2876	m189	PETER	I... I like you.  A lot.
L530263	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
L530262	u2876	m189	PETER	Hello, Liz.
L530203	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm here...
L530202	u2871	m189	LIZ	Peter?
L530201	u2871	m189	LIZ	Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is? what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
L530200	u2876	m189	PETER	Strong...
L530199	u2871	m189	LIZ	Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
L530198	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, God, I forgot to--
L530197	u2871	m189	LIZ	May's much better. She'll be out soon.
L530196	u2871	m189	LIZ	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
L530195	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
L530090	u2876	m189	PETER	Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
L530089	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
L530087	u2871	m189	LIZ	I know what you mean.  I...
L530086	u2876	m189	PETER	Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
L530085	u2871	m189	LIZ	Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
L530084	u2876	m189	PETER	You'd feel what?
L530083	u2871	m189	LIZ	"So?  The next day I'd read, ""Peter Parker murdered,"" and I'd feel..."
L530082	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, no.
L530081	u2871	m189	LIZ	You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
L530080	u2876	m189	PETER	They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
L530079	u2876	m189	PETER	I think I'd like that.
L530078	u2871	m189	LIZ	Do you mind if I come too?
L530077	u2876	m189	PETER	-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
L530073	u2876	m189	PETER	That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
L530072	u2871	m189	LIZ	This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
L530071	u2876	m189	PETER	No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
L530070	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh, don't do it on my account--
L530069	u2876	m189	PETER	Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
L530068	u2871	m189	LIZ	What's in the bag?  Garbage?
L529870	u2871	m189	LIZ	That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
L529869	u2876	m189	PETER	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
L529868	u2871	m189	LIZ	Sit down and stop being such a child.
L529865	u2876	m189	PETER	I've got no problems.
L529864	u2871	m189	LIZ	What's your problem?
L529863	u2876	m189	PETER	Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
L529860	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm sure you kept warm.
L529859	u2871	m189	LIZ	Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
L529858	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi, Adele.
L529857	u2871	m189	LIZ	Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
L529587	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh. Maybe I should, too--
L529586	u2876	m189	PETER	I've gotta study.
L529585	u2871	m189	LIZ	What are you doing this weekend?
L529584	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hurry up, Flash!
L529583	u2876	m189	PETER	I'd never admit that.
L529582	u2871	m189	LIZ	"Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like ""Flash."""
L529581	u2876	m189	PETER	Does it have a human name?
L529580	u2871	m189	LIZ	Some prep school thing.
L529579	u2876	m189	PETER	"Flash, Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself ""Flash."""
L529578	u2871	m189	LIZ	You should write that one down.
L529577	u2876	m189	PETER	But you like that in a man?
L529576	u2871	m189	LIZ	God, Flash can be such a jerk.
L529575	u2876	m189	PETER	What?
L529574	u2871	m189	LIZ	You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
L529573	u2876	m189	PETER	I suppose.
L529572	u2871	m189	LIZ	Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
L529571	u2876	m189	PETER	My my.
L529570	u2871	m189	LIZ	Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
L529569	u2876	m189	PETER	Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
L529568	u2871	m189	LIZ	He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
L529567	u2876	m189	PETER	Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
L529566	u2871	m189	LIZ	Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
L529565	u2876	m189	PETER	-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
L529548	u2876	m189	PETER	Thank God.
L529547	u2871	m189	LIZ	No.  I was lying about the coffee.
L529544	u2871	m189	LIZ	I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
L529543	u2876	m189	PETER	I hate--
L529542	u2871	m189	LIZ	I hate people with alliterative names.
L529541	u2876	m189	PETER	I hate the Platonic idea of you.
L529540	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
L529539	u2876	m189	PETER	I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
L529538	u2871	m189	LIZ	Uh is a good start.
L529537	u2876	m189	PETER	I-- uh--
L529536	u2871	m189	LIZ	"Fill in the blank: ""I blank Elizabeth Allan."""
L529535	u2876	m189	PETER	Huh?
L529534	u2871	m189	LIZ	It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
L529533	u2876	m189	PETER	It's too early to be clever.
L529532	u2871	m189	LIZ	How very dull, Peter Parker.
L529531	u2876	m189	PETER	Good morning, Liz.
L530211	u2878	m189	ROZ	Precise equipment? such as waldos?
L530210	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
L530208	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
L530207	u2878	m189	ROZ	Any sign of our friend?
L530206	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Yeah, Roz.
L530052	u2878	m189	ROZ	Peter-- my condolences.
L530051	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
L530050	u2878	m189	ROZ	"No such thing as coincidence.  ""God does not play dice with the universe."""
L530049	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
L530048	u2878	m189	ROZ	Of course.
L530046	u2878	m189	ROZ	I know him.
L530045	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	You sure about all this?
L530044	u2878	m189	ROZ	And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
L530043	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Toxic dumps, huh.
L530042	u2878	m189	ROZ	There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
L530041	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
L530040	u2878	m189	ROZ	Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
L530039	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
L530038	u2878	m189	ROZ	Waldos.
L530037	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
L530036	u2878	m189	ROZ	Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
L530035	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Some of him? char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
L530034	u2878	m189	ROZ	So you've found Thorkel?
L530033	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
L529980	u2873	m189	MAY	He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
L529979	u2876	m189	PETER	How is he?
L529978	u2873	m189	MAY	I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
L529977	u2876	m189	PETER	Aunt May, what happened?
L529976	u2873	m189	MAY	Oh, Ben gets through everything.
L529975	u2876	m189	PETER	It's fine.  Tell me what--
L529974	u2873	m189	MAY	Peter, you're bleeding.
L529675	u2873	m189	MAY	See?  You big dullard.
L529674	u2876	m189	PETER	A match made in heaven.
L529671	u2873	m189	MAY	Use a fork.
L529670	u2876	m189	PETER	Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
L529669	u2873	m189	MAY	Absolutely no class.
L529668	u2873	m189	MAY	You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
L529667	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
L529665	u2873	m189	MAY	Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
L529664	u2876	m189	PETER	What the hell is that?
L529620	u2873	m189	MAY	It'll shut itself off.
L529619	u2876	m189	PETER	The record--
L529618	u2876	m189	PETER	No.
L529617	u2873	m189	MAY	Yes.  Do you have a date?
L529616	u2876	m189	PETER	It's Friday night...
L529615	u2873	m189	MAY	Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
L529614	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm a photographer, remember?
L529613	u2873	m189	MAY	Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
L529612	u2876	m189	PETER	I'll introduce you.
L529611	u2873	m189	MAY	--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
L529610	u2876	m189	PETER	I am old enough to--
L529608	u2873	m189	MAY	Oh, Peter. A zit.
L529607	u2876	m189	PETER	When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
L529606	u2873	m189	MAY	Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
L529605	u2876	m189	PETER	Aunt May, you're trespassing.
L529604	u2873	m189	MAY	That's the understatement of the year.
L529603	u2876	m189	PETER	There's nothing in there worth stealing!
L529719	u2876	m189	PETER	Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
L529718	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
L529717	u2876	m189	PETER	I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
L529716	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Is this some sort of Zen thing?
L529715	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
L529714	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Poison emergency.
L529797	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
L529796	u2875	m189	OCK	I will finish what I've begun?
L529795	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering? the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron?
L529636	u2875	m189	OCK	No!
L529635	u2880	m189	THORKEL	That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
L529632	u2875	m189	OCK	I don't care.  Cretin.
L529631	u2880	m189	THORKEL	You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
L529630	u2875	m189	OCK	This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
L529629	u2880	m189	THORKEL	What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
L529628	u2875	m189	OCK	I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
L529627	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
L529626	u2880	m189	THORKEL	I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
L529625	u2875	m189	OCK	In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
L529624	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Let's talk in the hall.
L529623	u2875	m189	OCK	Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
L529622	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Power down.  I need to talk to you.
L529621	u2875	m189	OCK	Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
L530218	u2878	m189	ROZ	You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
L530217	u2875	m189	OCK	Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
L530216	u2878	m189	ROZ	My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
L529791	u2875	m189	OCK	Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
L529790	u2878	m189	ROZ	Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
L529789	u2878	m189	ROZ	No. It isn't.
L529788	u2875	m189	OCK	I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
L529787	u2878	m189	ROZ	Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
L529786	u2875	m189	OCK	Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
L529785	u2878	m189	ROZ	Creation? Or its opposite?
L529784	u2875	m189	OCK	You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
L529783	u2878	m189	ROZ	All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
L529782	u2875	m189	OCK	My? self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
L529780	u2875	m189	OCK	Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
L529779	u2878	m189	ROZ	A bit melodramatic? but if you could prove it? that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
L529682	u2875	m189	OCK	I left a paper in my desk.
L529681	u2878	m189	ROZ	I heard about Thorkel's order--
L529680	u2875	m189	OCK	No.  No thank you.  I have work.
L529529	u2878	m189	ROZ	Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
L529528	u2875	m189	OCK	Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
L529527	u2878	m189	ROZ	Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
L530260	u2878	m189	ROZ	If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
L530259	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
L530258	u2878	m189	ROZ	The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
L530058	u2876	m189	PETER	I'll try. Thanks.
L530057	u2878	m189	ROZ	You never know.  Go get some sleep.
L530056	u2876	m189	PETER	I don't think I'll be running into him.
L530055	u2878	m189	ROZ	Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
L530054	u2876	m189	PETER	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
L530053	u2878	m189	ROZ	"This photo you took of ""Spider-Man"" -"
L529889	u2878	m189	ROZ	No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
L529888	u2876	m189	PETER	Need any more help?
L529883	u2878	m189	ROZ	Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
L529882	u2876	m189	PETER	Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
L529881	u2878	m189	ROZ	How much do you know about it?
L529880	u2876	m189	PETER	Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
L529879	u2878	m189	ROZ	Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.

L529563	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi, Professor.  What's up?
L529562	u2878	m189	ROZ	Mr. Parker.
L529845	u2877	m189	REISS	Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
L529844	u2876	m189	PETER	Why? It is a wrestling match, or?
L529843	u2877	m189	REISS	Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
L529842	u2876	m189	PETER	No?
L529841	u2877	m189	REISS	I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
L529840	u2876	m189	PETER	Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
L529750	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
L529749	u2877	m189	REISS	Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
L529931	u2877	m189	REISS	I just gave-- yeah, sure.
L529930	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
L529929	u2877	m189	REISS	Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
L529928	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
L529927	u2877	m189	REISS	I asked if you felt like a drink--
L529926	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	What?
L529925	u2877	m189	REISS	... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
L529924	u2877	m189	REISS	Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
L529923	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	So they're airing this tonight?
L529906	u2877	m189	REISS	Nah.  The big mask was better.

L530176	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Phooey on that.
L530175	u2878	m189	ROZ	I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
L530174	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.

L530167	u2878	m189	ROZ	A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.

L530165	u2878	m189	ROZ	He'll try to finish his experiment.
L530164	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?

L534717	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
L534716	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
L534715	u2914	m192	CHEKOV	"An energy reading from 'C"" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters..."
L534714	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Chekov -- ?
L534912	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	On screen.
L534911	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
L534910	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Locate.
L534909	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
L534682	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
L534681	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
L534594	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
L534593	u2915	m192	COMM OFFICER	Aye sir, coding now.
L534691	u2916	m192	DAVID	Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
L534690	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
L534685	u2916	m192	DAVID	Not from here, no.
L534684	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	"Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: ""nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated."" Can you guarantee that?"
L534683	u2916	m192	DAVID	Why don't we beam it up?
L534676	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	What is it?
L534675	u2916	m192	DAVID	I don't believe it...
L534613	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
L534612	u2916	m192	DAVID	It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
L534611	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Could it be Spock's?
L535199	u2916	m192	DAVID	I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
L535198	u2918	m192	KIRK	David, I don't understand...
L535197	u2916	m192	DAVID	I went wrong.
L535196	u2918	m192	KIRK	David!... What went wrong?
L535195	u2916	m192	DAVID	It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
L535194	u2918	m192	KIRK	David... Sorry I'm late.
L535193	u2916	m192	DAVID	Hello, sir. It's David.
L535070	u2916	m192	DAVID	No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
L535069	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I'll go...
L535068	u2916	m192	DAVID	Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
L535067	u2916	m192	DAVID	I still don't...
L535066	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
L535065	u2916	m192	DAVID	I don't understand.
L535064	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
L535063	u2916	m192	DAVID	Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
L535062	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... How long?
L535061	u2916	m192	DAVID	The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
L535060	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	And Spock with it. They are joined together.
L535059	u2916	m192	DAVID	This planet is aging in surges.
L534951	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
L534950	u2916	m192	DAVID	If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
L534949	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	So, like your father, you changed the rules...
L534948	u2916	m192	DAVID	My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
L534947	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Did your collaborator know?
L534946	u2916	m192	DAVID	It was the only way to solve certain problems --
L534945	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
L534944	u2916	m192	DAVID	I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
L534943	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Why?
L534942	u2916	m192	DAVID	Not exactly.
L534941	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
L534940	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I have already made one transmission too many...
L534939	u2916	m192	DAVID	Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
L534938	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	That may be difficult...
L534937	u2916	m192	DAVID	How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
L534936	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Logic indicates that is the case.
L534935	u2916	m192	DAVID	You mean, we're stranded down here?!
L534934	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
L534933	u2916	m192	DAVID	Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
L534849	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
L534848	u2916	m192	DAVID	Later. Let's go...
L534783	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Spock's burial robe.
L534782	u2916	m192	DAVID	What is it?
L534780	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
L534779	u2916	m192	DAVID	Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
L534778	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	David --
L534777	u2916	m192	DAVID	.          .. Spock's tube...
L534770	u2916	m192	DAVID	We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
L534769	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	My readings indicate great instability.
L534768	u2916	m192	DAVID	I'll handle that later.
L534767	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
L534689	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... Or <u>who</u>.
L534688	u2916	m192	DAVID	Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
L534680	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
L534679	u2916	m192	DAVID	There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
L534674	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
L534673	u2916	m192	DAVID	Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
L534672	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
L534671	u2916	m192	DAVID	Short range scan.
L534670	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
L534610	u2916	m192	DAVID	A photon tube...!
L534609	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
L534608	u2916	m192	DAVID	There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
L534607	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
L534606	u2916	m192	DAVID	Underground deposit?
L534605	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Same sector. Metallic mass.
L534604	u2916	m192	DAVID	It's a little early to celebrate.
L534603	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
L534602	u2916	m192	DAVID	All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
L534601	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	... Fascinating.
L534600	u2916	m192	DAVID	It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
L534599	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
L534598	u2916	m192	DAVID	Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
L534597	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
L534596	u2916	m192	DAVID	This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
L534920	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
L534919	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain, what's happening?!
L534907	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
L534906	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
L534905	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
L534904	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	None that I can detect, sir.
L534903	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
L534902	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
L534901	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
L534896	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
L534895	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
L534847	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Do you have an explanation?
L534846	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
L534845	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
L534776	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	I'll try to remember that, Captain.
L534775	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
L534774	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
L534773	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
L534687	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger. I know the book, Saavik.
L534686	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
L534678	u2917	m192	ESTEBAN	You said there wouldn't be any.
L534677	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
L535294	u2918	m192	KIRK	Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
L535293	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Just him, sir!
L535292	u2918	m192	KIRK	How many more?
L535169	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
L535168	u2918	m192	KIRK	What's wrong?
L535167	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
L535166	u2918	m192	KIRK	I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
L535154	u2918	m192	KIRK	Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
L535153	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
L535152	u2918	m192	KIRK	Good shooting, Scotty.
L535146	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, sir!
L535145	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
L535143	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, sir!
L535142	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
L535074	u2918	m192	KIRK	Scan for vessels in pursuit!
L535073	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
L535032	u2918	m192	KIRK	The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
L535031	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Sir...?
L535030	u2918	m192	KIRK	Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
L535013	u2918	m192	KIRK	Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
L535012	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
L535011	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott?
L535008	u2918	m192	KIRK	Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
L535007	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
L534708	u2918	m192	KIRK	Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
L534707	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
L534706	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott...
L534631	u2918	m192	KIRK	Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
L534630	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
L534629	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
L534628	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
L534627	u2918	m192	KIRK	Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
L534626	u2925	m192	SCOTTY	I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
L535332	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Much is at stake...
L535331	u2918	m192	KIRK	My God...
L535321	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	. He will remain always as he is.
L535320	u2918	m192	KIRK	And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
L535319	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
L535318	u2918	m192	KIRK	But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
L535317	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
L535316	u2918	m192	KIRK	What? What are you saying?
L535315	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
L535307	u2918	m192	KIRK	Goodbye, David.
L535306	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	The Genesis planet is gone.
L535268	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
L535267	u2918	m192	KIRK	Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
L535264	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
L535263	u2918	m192	KIRK	What happened...?
L535192	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
L535191	u2918	m192	KIRK	This Vulcan -- is he alive?
L535190	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
L535189	u2918	m192	KIRK	Saavik... Is... David with you?
L535188	u2923	m192	SAAVIK	Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
L535362	u2918	m192	KIRK	You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
L535361	u2926	m192	SPOCK	The ship... Out of danger...?
L535360	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes, yes, Spock...
L535358	u2918	m192	KIRK	Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
L535357	u2926	m192	SPOCK	Why would you do this...?
L535356	u2918	m192	KIRK	You would have done the same for me.
L535355	u2926	m192	SPOCK	My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
L535354	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes. And I know you.
L535353	u2926	m192	SPOCK	I know you... Do I not?
L535329	u2928	m192	SULU	It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
L535328	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
L535323	u2918	m192	KIRK	Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
L535322	u2928	m192	SULU	The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
L535309	u2918	m192	KIRK	Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
L535308	u2928	m192	SULU	We are clear and free to navigate.
L535305	u2918	m192	KIRK	Go, Sulu!
L535304	u2928	m192	SULU	If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
L535246	u2918	m192	KIRK	Come on!
L535245	u2928	m192	SULU	Close... There --
L535244	u2918	m192	KIRK	What about surface life signs...?
L535243	u2928	m192	SULU	Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
L535214	u2918	m192	KIRK	With some on the planet...
L535213	u2928	m192	SULU	About a dozen officers and men.
L535212	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
L535151	u2918	m192	KIRK	Fire, Mr. Scott!
L535150	u2928	m192	SULU	Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
L535139	u2918	m192	KIRK	Red alert, Mr. Scott.
L535138	u2928	m192	SULU	... A cloaking device?
L535137	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
L535136	u2928	m192	SULU	I think it's an energy form, sir...
L535135	u2918	m192	KIRK	That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
L535131	u2928	m192	SULU	Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
L535130	u2918	m192	KIRK	See! That shimmering area.
L535091	u2918	m192	KIRK	What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
L535090	u2928	m192	SULU	We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
L535072	u2918	m192	KIRK	Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
L535071	u2928	m192	SULU	Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
L535050	u2918	m192	KIRK	Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
L535049	u2928	m192	SULU	Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
L535045	u2928	m192	SULU	Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
L535044	u2918	m192	KIRK	Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
L535035	u2918	m192	KIRK	FULL IMPULSE POWER!
L535034	u2928	m192	SULU	... We have cleared Spacedoors.
L534873	u2918	m192	KIRK	I'll need it, Sulu.
L534872	u2928	m192	SULU	Count on our help, sir.
L534871	u2918	m192	KIRK	The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
L534870	u2928	m192	SULU	The word, sir?
L534786	u2918	m192	KIRK	She's to be decommissioned.
L534785	u2928	m192	SULU	... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
L534621	u2918	m192	KIRK	Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
L534620	u2928	m192	SULU	On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
L535006	u2930	m192	UHURA	"Oh, I'll have ""Mr. Adventure"" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes."
L535005	u2918	m192	KIRK	Will you be able to handle that...?
L534995	u2930	m192	UHURA	Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
L534994	u2918	m192	KIRK	Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
L534993	u2930	m192	UHURA	Gentlemen. Good evening.
L534790	u2918	m192	KIRK	That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
L534789	u2930	m192	UHURA	How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
L534703	u2918	m192	KIRK	My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
L534702	u2930	m192	UHURA	Would you look at that?
L534694	u2930	m192	UHURA	Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
L534693	u2918	m192	KIRK	Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
L534625	u2918	m192	KIRK	Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
L534624	u2930	m192	UHURA	No, sir, no response.
L534623	u2918	m192	KIRK	Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
L534869	u2922	m192	MORROW	Any time.
L534868	u2918	m192	KIRK	You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
L534867	u2922	m192	MORROW	Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
L534866	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
L534864	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
L534863	u2922	m192	MORROW	Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
L534862	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
L534861	u2922	m192	MORROW	No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
L534860	u2918	m192	KIRK	As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
L534859	u2922	m192	MORROW	Yours...?!
L534858	u2918	m192	KIRK	Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
L534857	u2922	m192	MORROW	Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
L534856	u2918	m192	KIRK	Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
L534855	u2922	m192	MORROW	Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
L534747	u2922	m192	MORROW	Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
L534746	u2918	m192	KIRK	May I ask why...?
L534745	u2922	m192	MORROW	That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
L534744	u2918	m192	KIRK	Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
L534743	u2922	m192	MORROW	Genesis?! Whatever for?
L534742	u2918	m192	KIRK	But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
L534741	u2922	m192	MORROW	Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
L534740	u2918	m192	KIRK	Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
L534734	u2922	m192	MORROW	Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
L534733	u2918	m192	KIRK	Indisposed, sir.
L534732	u2922	m192	MORROW	Where's Doctor McCoy?
L534728	u2922	m192	MORROW	Welcome home, Jim.
L534727	u2918	m192	KIRK	Welcome aboard, Admiral.
L535289	u2918	m192	KIRK	Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
L535287	u2918	m192	KIRK	Give me your hand and we both live.
L535285	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
L535284	u2918	m192	KIRK	If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
L535283	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
L535282	u2918	m192	KIRK	You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
L535281	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
L535280	u2918	m192	KIRK	Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
L535279	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Genesis, I want it.
L535278	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Because you wish it.  
L535277	u2918	m192	KIRK	But, why?
L535276	u2919	m192	KRUGE	No.
L535275	u2918	m192	KIRK	You should take the Vulcan, too.
L535274	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
L535219	u2918	m192	KIRK	No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
L535218	u2919	m192	KRUGE	No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
L535217	u2918	m192	KIRK	Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
L535208	u2918	m192	KIRK	All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
L535207	u2919	m192	KRUGE	There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
L535202	u2918	m192	KIRK	Wait! Give me a chance --
L535201	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
L535200	u2918	m192	KIRK	David?... David!
L535187	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
L535186	u2918	m192	KIRK	Who is this?! How dare you --
L535185	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
L535164	u2918	m192	KIRK	Torpedoes coming in -- !
L535117	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Report status!
L535116	u2918	m192	KIRK	I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
L535352	u2918	m192	KIRK	If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
L535351	u2924	m192	SAREK	But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
L535350	u2918	m192	KIRK	What I have done, I had to do.
L535349	u2924	m192	SAREK	I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
L535348	u2918	m192	KIRK	What about Spock?
L534842	u2924	m192	SAREK	You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
L534841	u2918	m192	KIRK	What you ask is difficult.
L534840	u2924	m192	SAREK	You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
L534839	u2918	m192	KIRK	What must I do?
L534838	u2924	m192	SAREK	One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
L534837	u2918	m192	KIRK	Bones!...
L534826	u2918	m192	KIRK	Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
L534825	u2924	m192	SAREK	Yes... But -- how...?
L534824	u2918	m192	KIRK	Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
L534823	u2924	m192	SAREK	I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
L534822	u2918	m192	KIRK	But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
L534821	u2924	m192	SAREK	Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
L534820	u2918	m192	KIRK	... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
L534819	u2924	m192	SAREK	I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
L534818	u2918	m192	KIRK	... Spock...
L534817	u2924	m192	SAREK	... Or the one.
L534816	u2918	m192	KIRK	... The needs of the few...
L534815	u2924	m192	SAREK	... The needs of the many outweigh...
L534814	u2918	m192	KIRK	... Yes...
L534813	u2924	m192	SAREK	He asked you not to grieve...
L534812	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes...
L534811	u2924	m192	SAREK	... He spoke of your friendship.
L534810	u2918	m192	KIRK	Of course...!
L534809	u2924	m192	SAREK	Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
L534808	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then, how --
L534807	u2924	m192	SAREK	He would not have spoken of it openly.
L534806	u2918	m192	KIRK	Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
L534805	u2924	m192	SAREK	Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
L534804	u2918	m192	KIRK	But -- why?
L534803	u2924	m192	SAREK	Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
L534802	u2918	m192	KIRK	Yes, I was...
L534801	u2924	m192	SAREK	"You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was ""in death,"" Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him."
L534800	u2918	m192	KIRK	I -- saw no future --
L534799	u2924	m192	SAREK	Met his death?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
L534798	u2918	m192	KIRK	Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
L534797	u2924	m192	SAREK	Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
L534796	u2918	m192	KIRK	Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
L534794	u2924	m192	SAREK	I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
L534793	u2918	m192	KIRK	Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
L535211	u2919	m192	KRUGE	<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
L535210	u2929	m192	TORG	They outnumber us, my Lord --
L535209	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
L535184	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
L535183	u2929	m192	TORG	How can you tell that?
L535176	u2919	m192	KRUGE	They know we would die first.
L535175	u2929	m192	TORG	Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
L535174	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
L535119	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
L535118	u2929	m192	TORG	We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
L535108	u2929	m192	TORG	But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
L535107	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I ordered no interruptions.
L534930	u2929	m192	TORG	I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
L534929	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
L534928	u2929	m192	TORG	Sir, may I suggest --
L534761	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Station!
L534760	u2929	m192	TORG	Success, my lord.
L534759	u2919	m192	KRUGE	"We are going to this ""planet."" Even as our emissaries negotiate for ""peace"" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!"
L534758	u2929	m192	TORG	Understood, my lord.
L534757	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Share this with no one.
L534750	u2929	m192	TORG	Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
L534749	u2919	m192	KRUGE	So!  Speak!
L535254	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
L535253	u2921	m192	MALTZ	But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
L535252	u2919	m192	KRUGE	They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
L535251	u2921	m192	MALTZ	We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
L535250	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
L535249	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Sir, may I --
L535248	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
L535247	u2921	m192	MALTZ	My Lord... what are your orders?
L535178	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Put him on screen!  Study him well.
L535177	u2921	m192	MALTZ	My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
L535147	u2921	m192	MALTZ	500 Kellicams!
L535141	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Wait!... Wait...
L535140	u2921	m192	MALTZ	1,000 Kellicams, closing!
L535132	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Firing range, sir.
L535123	u2919	m192	KRUGE	Steady. Continue on impulse power.
L535122	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Range: 3000 Kellicams.
L534668	u2921	m192	MALTZ	Yes, my lord!
L534667	u2919	m192	KRUGE	I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
L535003	u2930	m192	UHURA	This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
L535002	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
L535001	u2930	m192	UHURA	I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
L535000	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
L534999	u2930	m192	UHURA	All true.
L534998	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
L534997	u2930	m192	UHURA	Good for you, Lieutenant.
L534996	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
L534992	u2930	m192	UHURA	You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
L534991	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
L534990	u2930	m192	UHURA	Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
L534989	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
L534988	u2930	m192	UHURA	How is that...?
L534987	u2920	m192	LIEUTENANT	You amaze me, Commander.
L534505	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
L534504	u2932	m193	BONES	You're not going in there -- !
L534503	u2943	m193	SPOCK	But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
L534502	u2932	m193	BONES	Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
L534064	u2932	m193	BONES	Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
L534063	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
L534062	u2932	m193	BONES	Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
L534061	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
L534060	u2932	m193	BONES	It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
L534059	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
L534058	u2932	m193	BONES	But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
L534582	u2938	m193	KIRK	Young. I feel young, Doctor.
L534581	u2932	m193	BONES	You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
L534401	u2932	m193	BONES	I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
L534400	u2938	m193	KIRK	Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
L534388	u2938	m193	KIRK	We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
L534387	u2932	m193	BONES	Until now.
L534381	u2938	m193	KIRK	And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
L534380	u2932	m193	BONES	Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
L534372	u2932	m193	BONES	It's like the Garden of Eden...
L534371	u2938	m193	KIRK	Now that's what I call a meal.
L534336	u2938	m193	KIRK	Our first order of business is survival.
L534335	u2932	m193	BONES	How can you think of food at a time like this?
L534334	u2938	m193	KIRK	Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
L534272	u2938	m193	KIRK	Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
L534271	u2932	m193	BONES	But what if they went -- nowhere?
L534270	u2938	m193	KIRK	Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
L534269	u2932	m193	BONES	Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
L534224	u2932	m193	BONES	This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
L534223	u2938	m193	KIRK	They even killed the galley chief.
L534213	u2932	m193	BONES	I can spare me...
L534212	u2938	m193	KIRK	He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
L534211	u2932	m193	BONES	Khan could be down there!
L534194	u2938	m193	KIRK	I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
L534193	u2932	m193	BONES	There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
L534192	u2938	m193	KIRK	At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
L534191	u2932	m193	BONES	Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
L534040	u2938	m193	KIRK	Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
L534039	u2932	m193	BONES	I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
L533983	u2938	m193	KIRK	As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
L533982	u2932	m193	BONES	It never rains but when it pours --
L533886	u2938	m193	KIRK	The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
L533885	u2932	m193	BONES	What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
L533861	u2938	m193	KIRK	Ah.
L533860	u2932	m193	BONES	Shore leave, Admiral.
L533791	u2932	m193	BONES	I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
L533790	u2938	m193	KIRK	Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
L533789	u2932	m193	BONES	From yourself, Admiral.
L533788	u2938	m193	KIRK	And who am I hiding from?
L533787	u2932	m193	BONES	Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
L533786	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
L533785	u2932	m193	BONES	What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
L533784	u2938	m193	KIRK	Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
L533783	u2932	m193	BONES	Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
L533782	u2938	m193	KIRK	Thank you.
L533781	u2932	m193	BONES	Say thank you.
L533780	u2938	m193	KIRK	Amazing! I don't know what to say --
L533779	u2932	m193	BONES	Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
L533778	u2932	m193	BONES	Exactly. Happy birthday.
L533777	u2938	m193	KIRK	But I'm allergic to Retlax.
L533776	u2932	m193	BONES	For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
L533775	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uh -- what are they?
L533774	u2932	m193	BONES	Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
L533773	u2938	m193	KIRK	Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
L533772	u2932	m193	BONES	More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
L533771	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
L533769	u2932	m193	BONES	Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
L533768	u2938	m193	KIRK	Twenty-two, eighty-three...
L533767	u2932	m193	BONES	I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
L533766	u2938	m193	KIRK	Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
L533765	u2932	m193	BONES	'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
L533764	u2938	m193	KIRK	Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
L533717	u2938	m193	KIRK	They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
L533716	u2932	m193	BONES	Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
L533704	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm not a drama critic.
L533703	u2932	m193	BONES	That's all you have to say?
L533702	u2938	m193	KIRK	Physician, heal thyself.
L533939	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
L533938	u2933	m193	CAROL	This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
L533934	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I have my orders.
L533933	u2933	m193	CAROL	But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
L533932	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
L533931	u2933	m193	CAROL	<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
L533930	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
L533929	u2933	m193	CAROL	I still don't under --
L533928	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
L533927	u2933	m193	CAROL	En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
L533926	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
L533925	u2933	m193	CAROL	Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
L533924	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
L534580	u2938	m193	KIRK	Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
L534579	u2933	m193	CAROL	Is that a poem?
L534578	u2938	m193	KIRK	It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
L534358	u2933	m193	CAROL	The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
L534357	u2938	m193	KIRK	You did this -- in a day?!
L534349	u2933	m193	CAROL	How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
L534348	u2938	m193	KIRK	Why? Why didn't you tell me?
L534347	u2933	m193	CAROL	David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
L534049	u2933	m193	CAROL	Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
L534048	u2938	m193	KIRK	Wait --
L533997	u2933	m193	CAROL	Jim please --
L533996	u2938	m193	KIRK	Carol!
L533995	u2933	m193	CAROL	... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
L533994	u2938	m193	KIRK	What order? Who's taking Genesis?
L533993	u2933	m193	CAROL	... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
L533992	u2938	m193	KIRK	Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
L533991	u2933	m193	CAROL	... taking Genesis away from us...
L533990	u2938	m193	KIRK	Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
L533989	u2933	m193	CAROL	... Can't read you... repeat...
L533988	u2938	m193	KIRK	Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
L533987	u2933	m193	CAROL	Jim... read me? Can you read me?
L534343	u2935	m193	DAVID	This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
L534342	u2933	m193	CAROL	David. Please.
L534340	u2935	m193	DAVID	But we can't just sit here -- !
L534339	u2933	m193	CAROL	This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
L534328	u2933	m193	CAROL	I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
L534327	u2935	m193	DAVID	So are we, it looks like.
L534285	u2933	m193	CAROL	You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
L534284	u2935	m193	DAVID	Go back. I'm going to kill him.
L534283	u2933	m193	CAROL	Jim --
L534282	u2935	m193	DAVID	Mother, go back!
L534281	u2933	m193	CAROL	David --
L533948	u2933	m193	CAROL	Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
L533947	u2935	m193	DAVID	I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
L533944	u2935	m193	DAVID	Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
L533943	u2933	m193	CAROL	Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
L533921	u2935	m193	DAVID	Who --
L533920	u2933	m193	CAROL	I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
L533919	u2935	m193	DAVID	Does that about do it?
L533761	u2935	m193	DAVID	Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
L533760	u2933	m193	CAROL	Maybe...
L533759	u2935	m193	DAVID	Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
L533758	u2933	m193	CAROL	Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
L533757	u2935	m193	DAVID	Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
L533756	u2933	m193	CAROL	I know, I know...
L533755	u2935	m193	DAVID	Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
L533754	u2933	m193	CAROL	And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
L533753	u2935	m193	DAVID	How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
L534249	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
L534248	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
L533818	u2946	m193	TERRELL	What do you want with us? I demand --
L533817	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
L533810	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Never mind! Hurry!
L533809	u2946	m193	TERRELL	But the child --
L533807	u2946	m193	TERRELL	What's the matter -- ?
L533806	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
L533805	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Ssssh!
L533804	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I told you! I told you I saw a --
L533801	u2946	m193	TERRELL	There's an air-lock.
L533800	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I saw it -- !
L533799	u2946	m193	TERRELL	You're crazy -- !
L533794	u2946	m193	TERRELL	I can hardly see --
L533793	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
L533792	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Are you sure these are the coordinates?
L533748	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	You know what she'll say...
L533747	u2946	m193	TERRELL	All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
L533746	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
L533745	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
L533744	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
L533743	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Don't tell me you've got something.
L533942	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
L533941	u2937	m193	KHAN	Well done, Commander.
L533915	u2937	m193	KHAN	I see. Helmsman?
L533914	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
L533913	u2937	m193	KHAN	Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
L533912	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
L533911	u2937	m193	KHAN	Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
L533910	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
L533835	u2937	m193	KHAN	There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
L533834	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
L533827	u2937	m193	KHAN	And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
L533826	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
L533825	u2937	m193	KHAN	<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
L533824	u2934	m193	CHEKOV	You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
L534567	u2935	m193	DAVID	Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
L534566	u2938	m193	KIRK	Is that what you came here to say?
L534565	u2935	m193	DAVID	I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
L534564	u2938	m193	KIRK	I am truly sorry.
L534563	u2935	m193	DAVID	So am I. My friends were killed, too.
L534562	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm trying, David.
L534561	u2935	m193	DAVID	But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
L534560	u2938	m193	KIRK	It was just words.
L534559	u2935	m193	DAVID	You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
L534558	u2938	m193	KIRK	Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
L534557	u2935	m193	DAVID	That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
L534556	u2938	m193	KIRK	I didn't expect anything.
L534555	u2935	m193	DAVID	No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
L534554	u2938	m193	KIRK	I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
L534553	u2935	m193	DAVID	Are you running away from me?
L534552	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
L534551	u2935	m193	DAVID	I don't mean to intrude.
L534496	u2935	m193	DAVID	You can't!
L534495	u2938	m193	KIRK	We'll beam aboard and stop it --
L534494	u2935	m193	DAVID	We encoded four minutes --
L534493	u2938	m193	KIRK	How soon --
L534492	u2935	m193	DAVID	He's on a build up to detonation!
L534491	u2938	m193	KIRK	What?
L534490	u2935	m193	DAVID	It's the Genesis Wave!
L534330	u2935	m193	DAVID	We appear to have plenty of time.
L534329	u2938	m193	KIRK	It's a long story.
L534290	u2935	m193	DAVID	She's making it up! My father was Professor --
L534289	u2938	m193	KIRK	Why didn't you tell me?
L534280	u2935	m193	DAVID	I'm Doctor Marcus!
L534279	u2938	m193	KIRK	Where's Dr. Marcus --
L534278	u2935	m193	DAVID	<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
L534277	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm Admiral Kirk...
L534370	u2935	m193	DAVID	I don't know.
L534369	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	What are <u>you</u> looking at?
L534368	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Oh, I believe it.
L534367	u2935	m193	DAVID	Don't you believe it.
L534366	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	The Admiral's son.
L534365	u2935	m193	DAVID	What are you looking at?
L534313	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Only half of you would get there.
L534312	u2935	m193	DAVID	Let go -- he can't -- !
L534462	u2937	m193	KHAN	I shall avenge you --
L534461	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Yours... is... the superior...
L534451	u2937	m193	KHAN	Raise the shields...
L534450	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Inoperative.
L534449	u2937	m193	KHAN	Tactical!
L534446	u2937	m193	KHAN	<u>Full power damn you</u>!
L534445	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
L534426	u2937	m193	KHAN	Rake her.
L534425	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	We'll lose them if they go in there.
L534363	u2937	m193	KHAN	Visual --
L534362	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Departing dark side, Regula.
L534320	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
L534319	u2937	m193	KHAN	Well?
L534172	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
L534171	u2937	m193	KHAN	No!
L534170	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
L534169	u2937	m193	KHAN	At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
L534167	u2937	m193	KHAN	<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
L534166	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	They won't --
L534165	u2937	m193	KHAN	Raise them --
L534164	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Sir -- our shields are dropping!
L534099	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Locking phasers on target.
L534098	u2937	m193	KHAN	Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
L534086	u2937	m193	KHAN	Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
L534085	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	They're still running with shields down.
L534084	u2937	m193	KHAN	Let them eat static.
L534083	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	They're requesting visual communications, sir.
L533909	u2937	m193	KHAN	It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
L533908	u2936	m193	JOACHIM	Steady on course. All systems normal.
L534318	u2938	m193	KIRK	KHAN!
L534317	u2937	m193	KHAN	Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
L534311	u2937	m193	KHAN	Perhaps I no longer need to try.
L534310	u2938	m193	KIRK	Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
L534309	u2937	m193	KHAN	Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
L534163	u2938	m193	KIRK	Here it comes. Now, Spock.
L534162	u2937	m193	KHAN	Time's up, Admiral...
L534159	u2938	m193	KIRK	I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
L534158	u2937	m193	KHAN	I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
L534157	u2938	m193	KIRK	Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
L534154	u2938	m193	KIRK	... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
L534153	u2937	m193	KHAN	Thirty seconds...
L534140	u2937	m193	KHAN	I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
L534139	u2938	m193	KIRK	Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
L534138	u2937	m193	KHAN	Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
L534137	u2938	m193	KIRK	Genesis, what's that?
L534135	u2937	m193	KHAN	That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
L534134	u2938	m193	KIRK	Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
L534133	u2937	m193	KHAN	-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
L534132	u2937	m193	KHAN	Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
L534131	u2938	m193	KIRK	What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
L534130	u2937	m193	KHAN	You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
L534302	u2937	m193	KHAN	First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
L534301	u2946	m193	TERRELL	All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
L534300	u2937	m193	KHAN	Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
L533823	u2937	m193	KHAN	Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
L533822	u2946	m193	TERRELL	I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
L533821	u2937	m193	KHAN	Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
L533820	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Listen to me -- you men and women --
L533819	u2937	m193	KHAN	You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
L533816	u2946	m193	TERRELL	Chekov, who is this man?
L533815	u2937	m193	KHAN	I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
L534482	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
L534481	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
L534210	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'm going down to the station.
L534209	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Just barely, sir.
L534121	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	A few shots, sir.
L534120	u2938	m193	KIRK	We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
L534119	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
L534118	u2938	m193	KIRK	Scotty -- what's left?
L534006	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Aye, sir --
L534005	u2938	m193	KIRK	We'll be going to warp speed --
L534004	u2942	m193	SCOTTY'S VOICE	Aye, sir.
L534003	u2938	m193	KIRK	An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
L534488	u2938	m193	KIRK	We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
L534487	u2947	m193	UHURA	Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
L534231	u2947	m193	UHURA	I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
L534230	u2938	m193	KIRK	Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
L534200	u2938	m193	KIRK	Sensors, Captain?
L534199	u2947	m193	UHURA	... No response, sir.
L534127	u2938	m193	KIRK	Do it, while we have time.
L534126	u2947	m193	UHURA	Admiral --
L534125	u2938	m193	KIRK	On screen.
L534110	u2938	m193	KIRK	Scotty, let's have it.
L534109	u2947	m193	UHURA	Mr. Scott on discrete.
L534095	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock?
L534094	u2947	m193	UHURA	I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
L534076	u2938	m193	KIRK	Picture, Mr. Saavik.
L534075	u2947	m193	UHURA	Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
L534074	u2938	m193	KIRK	Try the emergency channels...
L534073	u2947	m193	UHURA	She's not responding...
L533986	u2947	m193	UHURA	I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
L533985	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura. Can't you augment?
L534524	u2938	m193	KIRK	He'll die -- !
L534523	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
L534465	u2938	m193	KIRK	All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
L534464	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
L534414	u2938	m193	KIRK	No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
L534413	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
L534180	u2938	m193	KIRK	He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
L534179	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	<u>WHY</u>?
L533884	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	Aye, sir.
L533883	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Scott, the word is given.
L533882	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	Give the word, Admiral.
L533881	u2938	m193	KIRK	Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
L533880	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
L533879	u2938	m193	KIRK	Midshipman, you're a tiger.
L533859	u2938	m193	KIRK	Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
L533858	u2941	m193	SCOTTY	I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
L533857	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
L534390	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
L534389	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
L534263	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Not at present.
L534262	u2938	m193	KIRK	Meaning you can't even beam us back?
L534260	u2938	m193	KIRK	I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
L534259	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
L534258	u2938	m193	KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
L534187	u2938	m193	KIRK	Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
L534186	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
L534185	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes, Spock.
L534184	u2944	m193	SPOCK'S VOICE	Admiral, this is Spock.
L534183	u2938	m193	KIRK	If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
L534178	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Aye...
L534177	u2938	m193	KIRK	The word is given: warp speed.
L534176	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Is the word given?
L533877	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
L533876	u2938	m193	KIRK	Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
L533875	u2939	m193	PRESTON	I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
L533866	u2938	m193	KIRK	I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
L533865	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Yes, SIR.
L533864	u2938	m193	KIRK	Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
L533863	u2939	m193	PRESTON	Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
L533862	u2938	m193	KIRK	And who is this?
L534535	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
L534534	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock...!
L534533	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
L534532	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Or the one.
L534531	u2938	m193	KIRK	... the good of the few...
L534529	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes --
L534528	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The ship -- out of danger?
L534527	u2938	m193	KIRK	Spock!
L534471	u2943	m193	SPOCK	He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
L534470	u2938	m193	KIRK	He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
L534469	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
L534437	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura, patch me in --
L534436	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Admiral, they're reducing speed.
L534424	u2938	m193	KIRK	Steady as you go...
L534423	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
L534421	u2938	m193	KIRK	Best speed, Scotty...
L534420	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
L534412	u2938	m193	KIRK	Scotty, can we make it inside?
L534411	u2943	m193	SPOCK	She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
L534410	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uh oh.
L534406	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Best we could do in two hours.
L534405	u2938	m193	KIRK	That's it?
L534404	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
L534403	u2938	m193	KIRK	What IS working around here?
L534219	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Be careful, Jim...
L534218	u2938	m193	KIRK	Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
L534217	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Aye sir --
L534216	u2938	m193	KIRK	All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
L534208	u2938	m193	KIRK	Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
L534207	u2943	m193	SPOCK	A distinct possibility.
L534206	u2938	m193	KIRK	Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
L534205	u2943	m193	SPOCK	"Regula is class ""D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space."
L534204	u2938	m193	KIRK	... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
L534203	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Affirmative, Admiral.
L534202	u2938	m193	KIRK	And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
L534201	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
L534156	u2938	m193	KIRK	Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
L534155	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
L534152	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
L534151	u2938	m193	KIRK	You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
L534146	u2938	m193	KIRK	It's all we've got.
L534145	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The prefix code?
L534142	u2938	m193	KIRK	At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
L534141	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
L534123	u2938	m193	KIRK	Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
L534122	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Not enough against their shields.
L534116	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Too late --
L534115	u2938	m193	KIRK	Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
L534114	u2943	m193	SPOCK	One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
L534113	u2938	m193	KIRK	WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
L534112	u2943	m193	SPOCK	They knew just where to hit us.
L534101	u2938	m193	KIRK	Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
L534100	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
L534080	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It would explain a great many things --
L534079	u2938	m193	KIRK	Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
L534072	u2938	m193	KIRK	Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
L534071	u2943	m193	SPOCK	What's she doing here?
L534066	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
L534065	u2938	m193	KIRK	Gentlemen, this isn't --
L534057	u2938	m193	KIRK	The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
L534056	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Have they proceeded with their experiments?
L534055	u2938	m193	KIRK	The power of creation --
L534054	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It literally is Genesis...
L534045	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes.
L534044	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Carol Marcus --
L534037	u2943	m193	SPOCK	It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
L534036	u2938	m193	KIRK	Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
L534035	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
L534034	u2938	m193	KIRK	How far?
L534033	u2943	m193	SPOCK	There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
L534028	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
L534027	u2938	m193	KIRK	Will you accompany me to the bridge?
L534025	u2938	m193	KIRK	Or the one.
L534024	u2943	m193	SPOCK	That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
L534023	u2938	m193	KIRK	I would not presume to debate you.
L534022	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
L534021	u2938	m193	KIRK	You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
L534020	u2943	m193	SPOCK	You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
L534019	u2938	m193	KIRK	But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
L534018	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
L534017	u2938	m193	KIRK	That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
L534016	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
L534015	u2938	m193	KIRK	I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
L534014	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
L534013	u2938	m193	KIRK	Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
L533898	u2938	m193	KIRK	To be sure, Captain.
L533897	u2943	m193	SPOCK	There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
L533856	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes, we've been through death and life together.
L533855	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
L533854	u2938	m193	KIRK	Permission to come aboard, Captain?
L533734	u2938	m193	KIRK	Home.
L533733	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
L533732	u2938	m193	KIRK	Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
L533731	u2943	m193	SPOCK	None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
L533730	u2938	m193	KIRK	'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
L533729	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I know of your fondness for antiques.
L533728	u2938	m193	KIRK	Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
L533727	u2943	m193	SPOCK	She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
L533726	u2938	m193	KIRK	So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot?g?'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
L533725	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
L533724	u2938	m193	KIRK	It had the virtue of never having been tried.
L533723	u2943	m193	SPOCK	The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
L533722	u2938	m193	KIRK	They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
L533721	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I am understandably curious.
L533720	u2938	m193	KIRK	I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
L534266	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
L534265	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
L534264	u2938	m193	KIRK	Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
L534000	u2938	m193	KIRK	Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
L533999	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
L533998	u2938	m193	KIRK	Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
L533981	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	Yes, sir.
L533980	u2938	m193	KIRK	In my quarters, Uhura.
L533979	u2948	m193	UHURA'S VOICE	I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
L533978	u2938	m193	KIRK	Kirk here.
L534573	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir --
L534572	u2938	m193	KIRK	Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
L534571	u2938	m193	KIRK	Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
L534570	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
L534569	u2938	m193	KIRK	As you were, Mr. Saavik.
L534568	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Admiral on the bridge!
L534549	u2938	m193	KIRK	Dismiss the company.
L534548	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Understood, sir.
L534547	u2938	m193	KIRK	I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
L534546	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L534545	u2938	m193	KIRK	After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
L534515	u2938	m193	KIRK	Distance from Reliant...
L534514	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Three minutes, thirty seconds.
L534513	u2938	m193	KIRK	Time!
L534509	u2938	m193	KIRK	Engine room! What's happening?!
L534508	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Two minutes, ten seconds.
L534507	u2938	m193	KIRK	Time from my mark...
L534500	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L534499	u2938	m193	KIRK	Saavik, get us out, best speed!
L534480	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
L534479	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Power levels quite low, sir.
L534478	u2938	m193	KIRK	Cease fire. Look sharp.
L534474	u2938	m193	KIRK	Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
L534473	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	All stop, sir.
L534472	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Saavik, all stop.
L534457	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	At what.
L534456	u2938	m193	KIRK	Hold your course. Look sharp...
L534434	u2938	m193	KIRK	They just don't want us going in there.
L534433	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	That was close --
L534397	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
L534396	u2938	m193	KIRK	Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
L534393	u2938	m193	KIRK	Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
L534392	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
L534386	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
L534385	u2938	m193	KIRK	I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
L534384	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	<u>WHAT</u>?
L534383	u2938	m193	KIRK	I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
L534382	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	How?
L534379	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
L534378	u2938	m193	KIRK	Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
L534375	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
L534374	u2938	m193	KIRK	What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
L534345	u2938	m193	KIRK	As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
L534344	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Admiral?
L534257	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Stage Two of what?
L534256	u2938	m193	KIRK	If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
L534255	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
L534245	u2938	m193	KIRK	Erased...
L534244	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
L534222	u2938	m193	KIRK	Phasers on stun. Move out.
L534221	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Indeterminate life signs.
L534215	u2938	m193	KIRK	There is no such regulation.
L534214	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
L534148	u2938	m193	KIRK	We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
L534147	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	On screen...
L534144	u2938	m193	KIRK	HURRY.
L534143	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Reliant's command...
L534129	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Who?
L534128	u2938	m193	KIRK	Khan!
L534093	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Energize defense fields.
L534092	u2938	m193	KIRK	This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
L533972	u2938	m193	KIRK	Take the test again.
L533971	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Yes.
L533969	u2938	m193	KIRK	We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
L533968	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
L533967	u2938	m193	KIRK	That was a little joke.
L533966	u2938	m193	KIRK	You may ask, Lieutenant.
L533965	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
L533964	u2938	m193	KIRK	There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
L533963	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I failed to resolve the situation.
L533962	u2938	m193	KIRK	You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
L533961	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I did not think so.
L533960	u2938	m193	KIRK	You earned it.
L533959	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
L533958	u2938	m193	KIRK	Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
L533957	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	May I speak, sir?
L533956	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	It is still regulation, Admiral.
L533955	u2938	m193	KIRK	Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
L533715	u2938	m193	KIRK	Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
L533714	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
L533713	u2938	m193	KIRK	How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
L533712	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	... No, sir. It has not.
L533711	u2938	m193	KIRK	A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
L533710	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Because... there was no way to win.
L533709	u2938	m193	KIRK	And why not?
L533708	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
L533707	u2938	m193	KIRK	Very well.
L533706	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Permission to speak candidly, sir?
L533705	u2938	m193	KIRK	Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
L533700	u2938	m193	KIRK	Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
L533699	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Any suggestions, Admiral?
L534454	u2938	m193	KIRK	Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
L534453	u2945	m193	SULU	Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
L534408	u2938	m193	KIRK	Battle stations.
L534407	u2945	m193	SULU	Admiral on the bridge --
L534196	u2938	m193	KIRK	Try again.
L534195	u2945	m193	SULU	Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
L534174	u2938	m193	KIRK	<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
L534173	u2945	m193	SULU	Sir, you did it.
L534161	u2945	m193	SULU	Phasers locked...
L534160	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
L534107	u2938	m193	KIRK	Scotty!
L534106	u2945	m193	SULU	I can't get power, sir!
L534104	u2945	m193	SULU	Trying, sir!
L534103	u2938	m193	KIRK	Mr. Sulu... The shields!
L534088	u2938	m193	KIRK	Visual.
L534087	u2945	m193	SULU	Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
L534008	u2938	m193	KIRK	Engage warp engines --
L534007	u2945	m193	SULU	Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
L534002	u2945	m193	SULU	Stop engines.
L534001	u2938	m193	KIRK	Stop engines.
L533850	u2938	m193	KIRK	You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
L533849	u2945	m193	SULU	Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
L533848	u2938	m193	KIRK	I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
L533847	u2945	m193	SULU	I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
L533846	u2938	m193	KIRK	I really must thank you.
L534542	u2945	m193	SULU	Honors -- hup!
L534541	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
L534010	u2945	m193	SULU	Ready, sir.
L534009	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Prepare for warp speed.
L533905	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Course heading, Captain?
L533904	u2945	m193	SULU	We are clear and free to navigate.
L533900	u2945	m193	SULU	Aft thrusters, sir.
L533899	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
L533685	u2945	m193	SULU	I'll try, Captain.
L533684	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
L533681	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
L533680	u2945	m193	SULU	Shields activated!
L533672	u2945	m193	SULU	... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
L533671	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
L533670	u2945	m193	SULU	May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
L533655	u2945	m193	SULU	Aye, Captain.
L533654	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
L533653	u2945	m193	SULU	Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
L534399	u2943	m193	SPOCK	I exaggerated.
L534398	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	You lied.
L534395	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	By the book...
L534394	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Certainly...
L534091	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L534090	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
L534089	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
L533896	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L533895	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
L533894	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Never, sir.
L533893	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
L533892	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
L533891	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	All moorings are clear, Captain.
L533890	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Aye, sir.
L533889	u2943	m193	SPOCK	Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
L533873	u2943	m193	SPOCK	We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
L533872	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	He's very human.
L533871	u2943	m193	SPOCK	What did you expect, Lieutenant?
L533870	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	He's not what I expected, Sir.
L533695	u2943	m193	SPOCK	No power to the weapons system, sir.
L533694	u2940	m193	SAAVIK	Fire all phasers...!
L535439	u2949	m194	AMANDA	... They do, indeed.
L535438	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Humans make illogical decisions...
L535437	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
L535436	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I would accept that as an axiom.
L535435	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
L535434	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I do this because I was there,
L535433	u2949	m194	AMANDA	You do this -- for friendship?
L535432	u2967	m194	SPOCK	To Earth. To offer testimony.
L535431	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Where must you go?
L535430	u2967	m194	SPOCK	As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
L535429	u2949	m194	AMANDA	Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
L535428	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The question is irrelevant.
L535427	u2949	m194	AMANDA	You are half human. The Computer knows that.
L535426	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I do not understand the final question...
L536022	u2950	m194	BOB	Gillian --
L536021	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
L535774	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Why don't I?
L535773	u2950	m194	BOB	Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
L535772	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
L535771	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
L535770	u2950	m194	BOB	And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
L535769	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Yeah.
L535768	u2950	m194	BOB	I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
L535767	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Bob... it's tearing me apart.
L535766	u2950	m194	BOB	Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
L535765	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Fine. Just fine.
L535764	u2950	m194	BOB	How're you doing?
L535763	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Just a couple of kooks...
L535762	u2950	m194	BOB	Heard there was some excitement.
L535880	u2951	m194	BONES	A moment alone, please.
L535879	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
L535869	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Please...
L535868	u2951	m194	BONES	He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
L535859	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
L535858	u2951	m194	BONES	Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
L535857	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
L535836	u2951	m194	BONES	I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
L535835	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
L536268	u2958	m194	KIRK	Not me, Bones... They did it.
L536267	u2951	m194	BONES	Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
L536105	u2958	m194	KIRK	Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
L536104	u2951	m194	BONES	He's coming 'round, Jim...
L536103	u2958	m194	KIRK	Come on, Pavel...
L536102	u2951	m194	BONES	Wake up, man, wake up!
L536090	u2951	m194	BONES	Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
L536089	u2958	m194	KIRK	An experimental device, doctor.
L536082	u2951	m194	BONES	Cramps.
L536081	u2958	m194	KIRK	What did you say she was getting?
L536057	u2958	m194	KIRK	What do you think, Spock?
L536056	u2951	m194	BONES	Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
L535649	u2958	m194	KIRK	Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
L535648	u2951	m194	BONES	Oh, joy.
L535643	u2958	m194	KIRK	Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
L535642	u2951	m194	BONES	It doesn't look all that different.
L535572	u2958	m194	KIRK	If you have a better idea - now's the time.
L535571	u2951	m194	BONES	That's crazy!
L535570	u2958	m194	KIRK	-- That's the general idea.
L535569	u2951	m194	BONES	I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
L535568	u2958	m194	KIRK	Would you prefer to do nothing?
L535567	u2951	m194	BONES	Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
L535566	u2958	m194	KIRK	We've done it before.
L535565	u2951	m194	BONES	You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
L535551	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
L535550	u2951	m194	BONES	Now wait just a damn minute.
L535530	u2951	m194	BONES	No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
L535529	u2958	m194	KIRK	Bones, stay here.
L535518	u2951	m194	BONES	Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
L535517	u2958	m194	KIRK	Bones --
L535478	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
L535477	u2951	m194	BONES	Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
L535476	u2958	m194	KIRK	It'll come back to him.
L535475	u2951	m194	BONES	I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
L535474	u2958	m194	KIRK	What do you mean?
L535473	u2951	m194	BONES	You sure this is such a bright idea?
L535417	u2951	m194	BONES	I just wish we could cloak the stench.
L535416	u2958	m194	KIRK	We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
L535415	u2951	m194	BONES	You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
L536211	u2951	m194	BONES	It is.
L536210	u2967	m194	SPOCK	You're saying... It is a compliment.
L536209	u2951	m194	BONES	"No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your ""guesses"" than most other peoples facts."
L536208	u2967	m194	SPOCK	... I don't think he understands...
L536163	u2951	m194	BONES	Well nobody's perfect...
L536162	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Guessing is not in my nature...
L536161	u2951	m194	BONES	Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
L536160	u2967	m194	SPOCK	... Best shot...?
L536159	u2951	m194	BONES	Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
L536158	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Acceleration is no longer a constant.
L536157	u2951	m194	BONES	Naturally.  So what is your problem?
L536156	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
L536155	u2951	m194	BONES	You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
L535593	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
L535592	u2951	m194	BONES	Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
L535549	u2951	m194	BONES	Then how.?
L535548	u2967	m194	SPOCK	That is what I said, Doctor.
L535547	u2951	m194	BONES	You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
L535538	u2951	m194	BONES	... My God...
L535537	u2967	m194	SPOCK	10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
L535535	u2951	m194	BONES	That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
L535534	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Specifically, Humpback Whales.
L535516	u2951	m194	BONES	I liked him better before he died.
L535515	u2967	m194	SPOCK	There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
L535514	u2951	m194	BONES	"Really? You think this is its way of saying ""Hi there"" to the people of the Earth?"
L535513	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
L535507	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
L535506	u2951	m194	BONES	You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
L535505	u2967	m194	SPOCK	A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
L535504	u2951	m194	BONES	You're joking...!
L535503	u2967	m194	SPOCK	It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
L535502	u2951	m194	BONES	Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
L535501	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
L535500	u2951	m194	BONES	Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
L535499	u2967	m194	SPOCK	... My shoes...
L535498	u2951	m194	BONES	Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
L535497	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
L535496	u2951	m194	BONES	Hi... Busy?
L536096	u2951	m194	BONES	My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
L536095	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
L536094	u2951	m194	BONES	Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
L536093	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	Fundoscopic examination --
L536092	u2951	m194	BONES	How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
L536091	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	What's your degree in, dentistry?
L536088	u2951	m194	BONES	Reading the patient's vital signs.
L536087	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	What the hell do you think you're doing?
L536086	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	I was not informed about observers.
L536085	u2951	m194	BONES	We're just -- observing.
L536084	u2955	m194	DOCTOR	Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
L535383	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
L535382	u2965	m194	SCIENCE OFFICER	Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
L535381	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	Damage report!
L535375	u2965	m194	SCIENCE OFFICER	Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
L535374	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	Can you isolate the wave?
L535373	u2965	m194	SCIENCE OFFICER	Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
L535372	u2952	m194	CAPTAIN	What's causing that!?
L535944	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
L535943	u2970	m194	UHURA	How long?
L535784	u2970	m194	UHURA	It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
L535783	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	... It gives me a great sense of history.
L535782	u2970	m194	UHURA	I have the coordinates of the reactor...
L535781	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
L535695	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	"Yes, under ""U.S. Government."" Now we need directions."
L535694	u2970	m194	UHURA	Find it?
L536004	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I'm wery sorry, but --
L536003	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Go ahead. Stun me.
L536002	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
L536001	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
L535995	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I am? May I go now?
L535994	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	You play games with me and you're through
L535993	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	I do not know your name.
L535992	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	No, <u>my</u> name.
L535991	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	My name?
L535990	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Name?
L535989	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	The top of what?
L535988	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	All right. Let's take it from the top.
L535987	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
L535986	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
L535985	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Like what?
L535984	u2956	m194	FBI AGENT	All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
L536246	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
L536245	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
L536140	u2958	m194	KIRK	Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
L536139	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
L535789	u2958	m194	KIRK	Understood. What is your plan?
L535788	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
L535787	u2958	m194	KIRK	Ah, well done, team 2.
L535647	u2958	m194	KIRK	Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
L535646	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Yes, sir.
L535603	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Sir, heat shields at maximum!
L535602	u2958	m194	KIRK	No choice now, Scotty!
L535597	u2958	m194	KIRK	May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
L535596	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Shields, aye.
L535595	u2958	m194	KIRK	Shields, Mr. Chekov.
L535494	u2958	m194	KIRK	That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
L535493	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
L535460	u2958	m194	KIRK	Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
L535459	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
L535458	u2958	m194	KIRK	I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
L535457	u2953	m194	CHEKOV	Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
L535445	u2960	m194	MORROW	We are launching everything we have.
L535444	u2954	m194	COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Can you protect us?
L535443	u2960	m194	MORROW	We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
L535442	u2954	m194	COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Neutralized? How?
L535441	u2960	m194	MORROW	Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
L535440	u2954	m194	COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Status report, Admiral!
L535886	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Is there something wrong with the one I have?
L535885	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You sure you won't change your mind?
L535822	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
L535821	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
L535807	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I was not.
L535806	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	So you were at Berkeley.
L535743	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The hell they did.
L535742	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I suppose they told you that...?
L535741	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
L535735	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
L535734	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Attempting the hell to communicate.
L535717	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
L535716	u2967	m194	SPOCK	To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
L536284	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
L536283	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
L536282	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Why does it have to be goodbye?
L536281	u2958	m194	KIRK	You mean this is -- goodbye?
L536280	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
L536279	u2958	m194	KIRK	Hey! -- Where you going?!
L536220	u2958	m194	KIRK	... You have a point...
L536219	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
L536218	u2958	m194	KIRK	He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
L536217	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	... What does that mean?
L536178	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
L536177	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Oh my God, we're too late!
L536135	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You need me.
L536134	u2958	m194	KIRK	You tricked me.
L536127	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
L536126	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
L536125	u2958	m194	KIRK	I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
L536124	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
L536123	u2958	m194	KIRK	You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
L536122	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
L536121	u2958	m194	KIRK	All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
L536120	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
L536119	u2958	m194	KIRK	Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
L536117	u2958	m194	KIRK	Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
L536116	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
L536045	u2958	m194	KIRK	A spaceship with a missing man.
L536044	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
L536041	u2958	m194	KIRK	... Damn!
L536040	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
L536039	u2958	m194	KIRK	... Gone?!
L536038	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Kirk. They're gone.
L536037	u2958	m194	KIRK	We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
L536036	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	But Kirk...
L536035	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
L536034	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
L536033	u2958	m194	KIRK	Steady, now. We need your help.
L536032	u2958	m194	KIRK	Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
L536031	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	It's true... what you said...
L535955	u2958	m194	KIRK	Right.
L535954	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Here... In the park?
L535953	u2958	m194	KIRK	Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
L535952	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I bet you're a damn good poker player.
L535951	u2958	m194	KIRK	Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
L535950	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	So. There we are.
L535949	u2958	m194	KIRK	It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
L535948	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
L535947	u2958	m194	KIRK	You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
L535946	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	"Well, ""Admiral,"" that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard."
L535938	u2958	m194	KIRK	Noon tomorrow...?!
L535937	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
L535936	u2958	m194	KIRK	Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
L535935	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
L535934	u2958	m194	KIRK	You want the details?
L535933	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
L535932	u2958	m194	KIRK	That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
L535931	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I'm all ears.
L535930	u2958	m194	KIRK	All right. The truth?
L535929	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
L535928	u2958	m194	KIRK	No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
L535927	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
L535926	u2958	m194	KIRK	Who do you think I am?
L535925	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	... Who are you?
L535924	u2958	m194	KIRK	Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
L535923	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Wanna try it from the top?
L535919	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
L535918	u2958	m194	KIRK	What's what?
L535917	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	What's that?
L535916	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
L535915	u2958	m194	KIRK	What do you mean now?
L535914	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
L535913	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
L535912	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
L535911	u2958	m194	KIRK	Hm?
L535910	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Where could you take them?
L535909	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
L535908	u2958	m194	KIRK	If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
L535907	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Thanks. Cheers.
L535906	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
L535905	u2958	m194	KIRK	You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
L535904	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
L535903	u2958	m194	KIRK	Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
L535902	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
L535901	u2958	m194	KIRK	How will that be done, exactly?
L535900	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	... You're very perceptive.
L535899	u2958	m194	KIRK	You're upset about losing the whales.
L535898	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Just lucky, I guess.
L535897	u2958	m194	KIRK	So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
L535894	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
L535893	u2958	m194	KIRK	Implicitly.
L535892	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Do you trust me?
L535891	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's his way.
L535890	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
L535888	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
L535887	u2958	m194	KIRK	Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
L535831	u2958	m194	KIRK	Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
L535830	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Or believe, I'll bet.
L535829	u2958	m194	KIRK	In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
L535828	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Then --
L535827	u2958	m194	KIRK	We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
L535826	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
L535824	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
L535823	u2958	m194	KIRK	No, ma'am. No dipshit.
L535817	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
L535816	u2958	m194	KIRK	What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
L535815	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They're gonna hafta take their chances.
L535814	u2958	m194	KIRK	What's going to happen when you release the whales?
L535813	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Go ahead.
L535812	u2958	m194	KIRK	Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
L535811	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
L535810	u2958	m194	KIRK	Iowa.
L535809	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
L535808	u2958	m194	KIRK	Memory problems, too.
L535805	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
L535804	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thanks.
L535803	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	You've already been that. C'mon.
L535802	u2958	m194	KIRK	We don't want to be any trouble.
L535801	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
L535800	u2958	m194	KIRK	He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
L535799	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	I buy that. What about him?
L535798	u2958	m194	KIRK	There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
L535797	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
L535796	u2958	m194	KIRK	Back to San Francisco.
L535740	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
L535739	u2958	m194	KIRK	I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
L535738	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
L535726	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
L535725	u2958	m194	KIRK	How soon?
L535724	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
L535723	u2958	m194	KIRK	Why's that?
L535722	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
L535720	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
L535719	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
L535714	u2957	m194	GILLIAN	To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
L535713	u2958	m194	KIRK	You mean man...
L536257	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I will, Admiral.
L536256	u2958	m194	KIRK	You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
L536244	u2967	m194	SPOCK	No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
L536243	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock: Condition report!
L536234	u2958	m194	KIRK	Then... Where the hell are we?
L536233	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They did, Admiral.
L536232	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
L536227	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
L536226	u2958	m194	KIRK	Can we make breakaway speed!?
L536207	u2958	m194	KIRK	<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
L536206	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
L536205	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
L536130	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
L536129	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
L536061	u2958	m194	KIRK	Right.  Will you help us?
L536060	u2967	m194	SPOCK	No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
L536059	u2958	m194	KIRK	Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
L536058	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
L536047	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thank you, Spock.
L536046	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral. Full power is restored.
L535962	u2958	m194	KIRK	Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
L535961	u2967	m194	SPOCK	In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
L535960	u2958	m194	KIRK	Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
L535959	u2967	m194	SPOCK	No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
L535958	u2958	m194	KIRK	That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
L535957	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The tank will be finished by morning...
L535956	u2958	m194	KIRK	Status?
L535819	u2958	m194	KIRK	He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
L535818	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I meant --
L535793	u2967	m194	SPOCK	How will playing cards help?
L535792	u2958	m194	KIRK	It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
L535760	u2958	m194	KIRK	... I see.
L535759	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
L535758	u2958	m194	KIRK	They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
L535757	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
L535756	u2958	m194	KIRK	What else did you learn from your mind meld?
L535755	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The hell I can't
L535754	u2958	m194	KIRK	You've done it before. Can't you remember?
L535753	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Exaggerate.
L535752	u2958	m194	KIRK	You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
L535751	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I cannot tell a lie.
L535750	u2958	m194	KIRK	And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
L535749	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I see.
L535748	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
L535747	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Why not?
L535746	u2958	m194	KIRK	About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
L535745	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Yes?
L535744	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock...
L535737	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
L535736	u2958	m194	KIRK	Come on, fellah -- speak up!
L535708	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Ah... The giants.
L535707	u2958	m194	KIRK	Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
L535706	u2967	m194	SPOCK	For example?
L535705	u2958	m194	KIRK	You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
L535704	u2967	m194	SPOCK	"Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: ""Double dumb ass on you"" -- and so forth..."
L535703	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
L535702	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, may I ask you a question?
L535701	u2958	m194	KIRK	Yes.
L535700	u2967	m194	SPOCK	As you observed, a primitive Culture.
L535687	u2958	m194	KIRK	... Simple logic.
L535686	u2967	m194	SPOCK	How do you know this...?
L535685	u2958	m194	KIRK	I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
L535683	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
L535682	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
L535678	u2958	m194	KIRK	And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
L535677	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
L535641	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
L535640	u2958	m194	KIRK	Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
L535639	u2967	m194	SPOCK	We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
L535638	u2958	m194	KIRK	But you said toxic.
L535637	u2967	m194	SPOCK	If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
L535636	u2958	m194	KIRK	Explain.
L535635	u2967	m194	SPOCK	There is a 20th Century possibility.
L535621	u2958	m194	KIRK	Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
L535620	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
L535619	u2958	m194	KIRK	Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
L535616	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well done, Mr. Spock.
L535615	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
L535614	u2958	m194	KIRK	Earth... But when?... Spock?
L535591	u2967	m194	SPOCK	I have.
L535590	u2958	m194	KIRK	You've programmed that from memory...?
L535589	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
L535588	u2958	m194	KIRK	What are the variables...?
L535587	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
L535586	u2958	m194	KIRK	Surely you can be more specific...
L535585	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The late 20th Century.
L535584	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is our target in time?
L535583	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
L535575	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
L535574	u2967	m194	SPOCK	In progress, Admiral.
L535573	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Spock, your computations?
L535546	u2967	m194	SPOCK	There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
L535545	u2958	m194	KIRK	But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
L535544	u2967	m194	SPOCK	That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
L535543	u2958	m194	KIRK	That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
L535542	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
L535541	u2958	m194	KIRK	Is there any other planet where this species exists?
L535540	u2967	m194	SPOCK	The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
L535539	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
L535533	u2958	m194	KIRK	Whales?
L535532	u2967	m194	SPOCK	As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
L535531	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock...?
L535528	u2967	m194	SPOCK	To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
L535527	u2958	m194	KIRK	Where are you going?!
L535521	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
L535520	u2967	m194	SPOCK	A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
L535519	u2958	m194	KIRK	Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
L535472	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
L535471	u2967	m194	SPOCK	It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
L535470	u2958	m194	KIRK	Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
L535469	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Thank you, Admiral.
L535468	u2958	m194	KIRK	Permission granted.
L535467	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Permission to come aboard.
L536303	u2968	m194	SULU	Aye, sir!
L536302	u2958	m194	KIRK	Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
L536254	u2958	m194	KIRK	Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
L536253	u2968	m194	SULU	Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
L536248	u2958	m194	KIRK	Picture, Uhura!
L536247	u2968	m194	SULU	I have no control, sir!
L536184	u2958	m194	KIRK	Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
L536183	u2968	m194	SULU	10 seconds, sir!
L536148	u2968	m194	SULU	Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
L536147	u2958	m194	KIRK	Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
L536146	u2968	m194	SULU	10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
L536144	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
L536143	u2968	m194	SULU	Three-one-zero, aye!
L536142	u2958	m194	KIRK	Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
L536141	u2968	m194	SULU	Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
L536137	u2958	m194	KIRK	Go, Mr. Sulu.
L536136	u2968	m194	SULU	Ready sir.
L535645	u2958	m194	KIRK	We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
L535644	u2968	m194	SULU	Aye, sir. Descending.
L535613	u2958	m194	KIRK	Picture, please.
L535612	u2968	m194	SULU	Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
L535611	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is our condition?
L535610	u2968	m194	SULU	... Aye sir...?
L535609	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
L535607	u2958	m194	KIRK	Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
L535606	u2968	m194	SULU	Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
L535605	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
L535604	u2968	m194	SULU	Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
L535599	u2958	m194	KIRK	Steady as she goes...
L535598	u2968	m194	SULU	Warp two... three...
L535492	u2958	m194	KIRK	Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
L535491	u2968	m194	SULU	Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
L535456	u2958	m194	KIRK	Weapons systems?
L535455	u2968	m194	SULU	Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
L536250	u2958	m194	KIRK	Out of control, and blind as a bat!
L536249	u2970	m194	UHURA	I can't, sir -- Nothing!
L536199	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Scott -- how soon?
L536198	u2970	m194	UHURA	Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
L536176	u2970	m194	UHURA	Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
L536175	u2958	m194	KIRK	Estimate range, ship to whales!
L536172	u2958	m194	KIRK	On screen.
L536171	u2970	m194	UHURA	Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
L536168	u2958	m194	KIRK	Put them on screen!
L536167	u2970	m194	UHURA	Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
L536166	u2958	m194	KIRK	Bearing!
L536053	u2970	m194	UHURA	Mercy Hospital.
L536052	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura!... Where!
L536051	u2970	m194	UHURA	I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
L536012	u2958	m194	KIRK	Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
L536011	u2970	m194	UHURA	Nothing... I should never have left him...
L536010	u2958	m194	KIRK	Any luck...?
L535660	u2958	m194	KIRK	Everyone remember where we parked.
L535659	u2970	m194	UHURA	283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
L535658	u2958	m194	KIRK	We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
L535651	u2958	m194	KIRK	Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
L535650	u2970	m194	UHURA	I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
L535625	u2958	m194	KIRK	From a city? That doesn't make sense....
L535624	u2970	m194	UHURA	Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
L535618	u2958	m194	KIRK	On speakers.
L535617	u2970	m194	UHURA	Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
L535525	u2970	m194	UHURA	Yes, sir.
L535524	u2958	m194	KIRK	Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
L535510	u2958	m194	KIRK	On screen!
L535509	u2970	m194	UHURA	Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
L535508	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is it?
L535454	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu?
L535453	u2970	m194	UHURA	Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
L535452	u2958	m194	KIRK	Systems report.  Communications?
L536297	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
L536296	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
L536263	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Admiral, you'll be trapped!
L536262	u2958	m194	KIRK	Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
L536261	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
L536260	u2958	m194	KIRK	The explosive override -- ?
L536259	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	No power to the bay doors.
L536258	u2958	m194	KIRK	The whales...?!
L536222	u2958	m194	KIRK	On my way...!
L536221	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
L536214	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
L536213	u2958	m194	KIRK	Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
L536203	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, if you please.
L536202	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Full power, sir.
L536201	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
L536200	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
L536197	u2958	m194	KIRK	Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
L536196	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I'll have to re-energize.
L536195	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
L536194	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Admiral! There be whales here!
L536193	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
L536192	u2958	m194	KIRK	How long, Scotty?
L536191	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
L536150	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
L536149	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
L536132	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Sulu?
L536131	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
L536016	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
L536015	u2958	m194	KIRK	Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
L536014	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
L535922	u2958	m194	KIRK	Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
L535921	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
L535920	u2958	m194	KIRK	What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
L535634	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
L535633	u2958	m194	KIRK	I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
L535632	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
L535631	u2958	m194	KIRK	Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
L535630	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
L535563	u2958	m194	KIRK	It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
L535562	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Two?
L535561	u2958	m194	KIRK	You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
L535560	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
L535559	u2958	m194	KIRK	Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
L535558	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Humpbacked - people.?
L535557	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
L535555	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
L535554	u2958	m194	KIRK	That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
L535553	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	About 60 feet, Admiral.
L535552	u2958	m194	KIRK	Scotty, how long is this bay?
L535462	u2958	m194	KIRK	Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
L535461	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
L535414	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
L535413	u2958	m194	KIRK	Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
L535464	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
L535463	u2958	m194	KIRK	Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
L535423	u2958	m194	KIRK	You will be in good hands here.
L535422	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	I am well, Admiral.
L535421	u2958	m194	KIRK	Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
L535420	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
L535419	u2958	m194	KIRK	Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
L535418	u2963	m194	SAAVIK	Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
L535398	u2964	m194	SAREK	Do you have the right to murder?
L535397	u2959	m194	KLINGON AMBASSADOR	We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
L535396	u2964	m194	SAREK	Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
L535395	u2959	m194	KLINGON AMBASSADOR	Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
L535394	u2964	m194	SAREK	Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
L535393	u2964	m194	SAREK	Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
L535392	u2959	m194	KLINGON AMBASSADOR	"Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called ""The Genesis Planet..."" A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!"
L535876	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
L535875	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	That's the ticket, laddie.
L535874	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Transparent aluminum?
L535873	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	The keyboard... How quaint.
L535872	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Just use the keyboard...
L535871	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Hello? Computer...?
L535867	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	... Are you joking?
L535866	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
L535865	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
L535864	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
L535863	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Sill? What else would I be working with?
L535862	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I notice you're still working with polymers.
L535861	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	... Yes?
L535860	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
L535849	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Of course.
L535848	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I will. Can my assistant come, too?
L535847	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	If you'll follow me, Professor --
L535846	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Well, that's different.
L535845	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	With pleasure.
L535842	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	I demand to see the owners! I demand --
L535841	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Professor Scott, if you'll --
L535838	u2961	m194	NICHOLS	Millions?
L535837	u2966	m194	SCOTTY	Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
L535856	u2968	m194	SULU	Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
L535855	u2962	m194	PILOT	All right, then this is old stuff to you.
L535854	u2968	m194	SULU	Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
L535853	u2962	m194	PILOT	Right on. You fly?
L535852	u2968	m194	SULU	Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
L535851	u2962	m194	PILOT	Hi.
L536293	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Tell her I feel fine...
L536292	u2964	m194	SAREK	Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
L536291	u2967	m194	SPOCK	They are my friends.
L536290	u2964	m194	SAREK	As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
L536289	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Most kind, Father.
L536288	u2964	m194	SAREK	It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
L536287	u2967	m194	SPOCK	It is kind of you to make this effort.
L536286	u2964	m194	SAREK	I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
L536285	u2967	m194	SPOCK	Father...?
L535672	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
L535671	u2968	m194	SULU	Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
L535670	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Sulu Hikaru.
L535669	u2968	m194	SULU	Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
L535668	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
L535667	u2968	m194	SULU	Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
L535666	u2969	m194	THE BOY	Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
L537130	u2980	m195	PICARD	"The ""mighty"" Federation could learn a few things from this village..."
L537129	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
L537117	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I'll be here.
L537116	u2980	m195	PICARD	But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
L537112	u2980	m195	PICARD	I thought it might begin the healing process.
L537111	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Mother and son. You arranged this...?
L537007	u2980	m195	PICARD	You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
L537006	u2971	m195	ANIJ	You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
L536893	u2980	m195	PICARD	This way!
L536892	u2971	m195	ANIJ	There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
L536867	u2980	m195	PICARD	I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
L536866	u2971	m195	ANIJ	What's the rush?
L536865	u2980	m195	PICARD	"How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you ""just haven't gotten around to it yet""..."
L536863	u2980	m195	PICARD	By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
L536862	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
L536859	u2980	m195	PICARD	Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
L536858	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Jak'tahla?
L536799	u2980	m195	PICARD	We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...
L536798	u2971	m195	ANIJ	There are caves in those mountains.
L536797	u2980	m195	PICARD	When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
L536730	u2971	m195	ANIJ	For someone so young.
L536729	u2980	m195	PICARD	... an offlander?
L536728	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
L536727	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
L536726	u2980	m195	PICARD	There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
L536725	u2971	m195	ANIJ	It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
L536724	u2980	m195	PICARD	I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
L536723	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
L536722	u2980	m195	PICARD	Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
L536721	u2971	m195	ANIJ	When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
L536720	u2980	m195	PICARD	A perfect moment?
L536719	u2971	m195	ANIJ	You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
L536718	u2980	m195	PICARD	Will it?
L536717	u2971	m195	ANIJ	More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
L536716	u2980	m195	PICARD	An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
L536715	u2971	m195	ANIJ	This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
L536714	u2980	m195	PICARD	The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
L536713	u2980	m195	PICARD	You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
L536712	u2971	m195	ANIJ	... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
L536711	u2980	m195	PICARD	In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
L536710	u2971	m195	ANIJ	You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
L536709	u2980	m195	PICARD	There are days.
L536708	u2971	m195	ANIJ	But not you.
L536707	u2980	m195	PICARD	Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
L536706	u2971	m195	ANIJ	We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
L536705	u2980	m195	PICARD	Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
L536696	u2980	m195	PICARD	We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
L536695	u2971	m195	ANIJ	There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
L536663	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
L536662	u2980	m195	PICARD	Don't panic...
L536657	u2980	m195	PICARD	To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
L536656	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Deceive us?
L536653	u2980	m195	PICARD	Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
L536652	u2971	m195	ANIJ	I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
L536609	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Then you must spend your life answering questions.
L536608	u2980	m195	PICARD	I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
L536607	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Why?
L536606	u2980	m195	PICARD	I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
L536549	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
L536548	u2980	m195	PICARD	You have warp capability?
L536543	u2980	m195	PICARD	If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
L536542	u2971	m195	ANIJ	Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
L536541	u2980	m195	PICARD	My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
L536537	u2971	m195	ANIJ	It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
L536536	u2980	m195	PICARD	We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
L537134	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Bye.
L537133	u2974	m195	DATA	I have to go home now.
L536968	u2974	m195	DATA	It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
L536967	u2972	m195	ARTIM	No... I want to stay with you...
L536966	u2974	m195	DATA	Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
L536965	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Anij!
L536855	u2972	m195	ARTIM	If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
L536854	u2974	m195	DATA	No one's ever asked me that before.
L536853	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Why not...?
L536852	u2974	m195	DATA	Androids... don't have...fun.
L536851	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
L536850	u2974	m195	DATA	But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
L536849	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
L536848	u2974	m195	DATA	For what purpose?
L536847	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Chase me!
L536844	u2972	m195	ARTIM	No, I mean...
L536843	u2974	m195	DATA	I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
L536842	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Do machines ever play?
L536841	u2974	m195	DATA	I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
L536840	u2972	m195	ARTIM	But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
L536839	u2974	m195	DATA	My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
L536838	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Sometimes I do.
L536837	u2974	m195	DATA	But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
L536836	u2972	m195	ARTIM	For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
L536835	u2974	m195	DATA	Really.
L536834	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Really?
L536833	u2974	m195	DATA	Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
L536832	u2972	m195	ARTIM	I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
L536831	u2974	m195	DATA	My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
L536830	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Don't you ever get tired?
L536829	u2974	m195	DATA	Perhaps, that is true.
L536828	u2972	m195	ARTIM	I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
L536827	u2974	m195	DATA	I aspire to be more than I am.
L536826	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
L536825	u2972	m195	ARTIM	I don't.
L536824	u2974	m195	DATA	I understand.
L536823	u2972	m195	ARTIM	My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
L536612	u2974	m195	DATA	I am better.
L536611	u2972	m195	ARTIM	You're what?
L536610	u2974	m195	DATA	There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
L536701	u2980	m195	PICARD	If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
L536700	u2972	m195	ARTIM	The artificial lifeform was right?
L536699	u2980	m195	PICARD	To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
L536639	u2980	m195	PICARD	No.
L536638	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Won't he rust?
L536637	u2980	m195	PICARD	Data doesn't breathe.
L536636	u2972	m195	ARTIM	Can he breathe under water?
L536684	u2981	m195	PICARD'S COM VOICE	Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
L536683	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
L536682	u2981	m195	PICARD'S COM VOICE	Are they in any danger?
L536681	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
L536680	u2981	m195	PICARD'S COM VOICE	And our people?
L536679	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
L536988	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Safer than leaving her here.
L536987	u2980	m195	PICARD	Is it safe to move her?
L536986	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	She's stabilizing.
L536956	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Yes. But look at this medscan...
L536955	u2980	m195	PICARD	Will he live?
L536535	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
L536534	u2980	m195	PICARD	Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
L536349	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
L536348	u2980	m195	PICARD	Very funny...
L536328	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
L536327	u2980	m195	PICARD	'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
L536326	u2973	m195	CRUSHER	You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
L536934	u2974	m195	DATA	I believe it is safe, sir.
L536933	u2980	m195	PICARD	Will the structure hold if we blast through?
L536932	u2974	m195	DATA	I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
L536927	u2974	m195	DATA	Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
L536926	u2980	m195	PICARD	How many?
L536801	u2980	m195	PICARD	Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
L536800	u2974	m195	DATA	Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
L536659	u2980	m195	PICARD	I don't know.
L536658	u2974	m195	DATA	Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
L536655	u2980	m195	PICARD	What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
L536654	u2974	m195	DATA	... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
L536651	u2980	m195	PICARD	What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
L536650	u2974	m195	DATA	Incomplete, I might add.
L536645	u2980	m195	PICARD	'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
L536644	u2974	m195	DATA	It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
L536643	u2980	m195	PICARD	A ship,
L536634	u2980	m195	PICARD	How about a passive radiation scan?
L536633	u2974	m195	DATA	Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
L536617	u2974	m195	DATA	And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
L536616	u2980	m195	PICARD	Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
L536615	u2974	m195	DATA	... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
L536614	u2980	m195	PICARD	It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
L536613	u2974	m195	DATA	I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
L536601	u2974	m195	DATA	I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
L536600	u2980	m195	PICARD	From the mission...
L536599	u2974	m195	DATA	'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
L536598	u2980	m195	PICARD	What's the last thing you remember, Data...
L536597	u2974	m195	DATA	Yes... that looks like them.
L536594	u2980	m195	PICARD	You're aboard the Enterprise.
L536593	u2974	m195	DATA	Captain, Geordi...?
L536592	u2980	m195	PICARD	Hello, Data...
L537013	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
L537012	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	I do not take orders from you.
L537011	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	It is over.
L537010	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	It is not over.
L537009	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
L536999	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
L536998	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	You're not going to launch anything until...
L536820	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
L536819	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I'll order Riker to turn around.
L536816	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
L536815	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
L536814	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
L536813	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
L536467	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
L536466	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
L536464	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
L536463	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
L536392	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
L536391	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
L536390	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Another time.
L536389	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
L536387	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
L536386	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
L536385	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
L536996	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	There's nothing further to be gained from this...
L536995	u2980	m195	PICARD	I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
L536992	u2980	m195	PICARD	If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
L536991	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
L536764	u2980	m195	PICARD	How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
L536763	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
L536762	u2980	m195	PICARD	We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
L536761	u2980	m195	PICARD	The Ba'ku.
L536760	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
L536759	u2980	m195	PICARD	Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
L536758	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
L536757	u2980	m195	PICARD	Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
L536756	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
L536755	u2980	m195	PICARD	There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
L536754	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
L536753	u2980	m195	PICARD	Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
L536752	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
L536751	u2980	m195	PICARD	Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
L536750	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
L536749	u2980	m195	PICARD	A planet in Federation space...
L536748	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
L536747	u2980	m195	PICARD	Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
L536746	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
L536745	u2980	m195	PICARD	How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
L536744	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
L536743	u2980	m195	PICARD	... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
L536742	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
L536741	u2980	m195	PICARD	"Your ""Briar Patch"" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected."
L536740	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
L536557	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
L536556	u2980	m195	PICARD	You're not finished here?
L536555	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
L536554	u2980	m195	PICARD	In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
L536553	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
L536552	u2980	m195	PICARD	... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
L536471	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Good luck. Dougherty out.
L536470	u2980	m195	PICARD	Understood.
L536469	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
L536462	u2980	m195	PICARD	Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
L536461	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
L536460	u2980	m195	PICARD	This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
L536459	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
L536376	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
L536375	u2980	m195	PICARD	What kind of concerns?
L536374	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
L536373	u2980	m195	PICARD	The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
L536372	u2975	m195	DOUGHERTY	... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
L536371	u2980	m195	PICARD	You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
L537095	u2980	m195	PICARD	Scan for lifesigns.
L537094	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
L537039	u2980	m195	PICARD	What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
L537038	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
L537037	u2980	m195	PICARD	If we could lure him away from the bridge...
L537036	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
L537035	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you know how to disable the injector?
L537034	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
L537032	u2980	m195	PICARD	I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
L537031	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
L537030	u2980	m195	PICARD	A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
L537023	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Thank-you for reminding me.
L537022	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
L537021	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
L537020	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
L537019	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
L537018	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Deploy the collector.
L537017	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	May I talk to you alone?
L537016	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
L536818	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
L536817	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
L536812	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Recommendations?
L536811	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
L536791	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
L536790	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
L536789	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
L536771	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
L536770	u2976	m195	GALLATIN	No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
L536769	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
L536734	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
L536733	u2980	m195	PICARD	... had regenerated.
L536732	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
L536591	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	It's nothing. I'm just tired.
L536590	u2980	m195	PICARD	Implants bothering you?
L536589	u2980	m195	PICARD	And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
L536588	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
L536587	u2980	m195	PICARD	So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
L536586	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
L536585	u2980	m195	PICARD	Fail-safe?
L536584	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
L536583	u2980	m195	PICARD	Why would they fire at him without provocation?
L536582	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I don't believe it happened that way.
L536581	u2980	m195	PICARD	The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
L536580	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
L536579	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you know how they were damaged?
L536578	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
L536454	u2980	m195	PICARD	When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
L536453	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
L536414	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you have everything you need from command?
L536413	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
L536383	u2980	m195	PICARD	Are they...?
L536382	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	They... are in opposite directions, sir...
L536381	u2980	m195	PICARD	I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
L536916	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
L536915	u2982	m195	RIKER	That's your expert opinion?
L536914	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	You got me, Commander.
L536913	u2982	m195	RIKER	Will that stop the tear?
L536881	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I'll be in Engineering.
L536880	u2982	m195	RIKER	If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
L536879	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
L536878	u2982	m195	RIKER	Full impulse.
L536877	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
L536876	u2982	m195	RIKER	A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
L536945	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
L536944	u2983	m195	RIKER'S COM VOICE	If it works you mean.
L536943	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
L536939	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	The purpose being...?
L536938	u2983	m195	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
L536937	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
L536912	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	Eject the core.
L536911	u2983	m195	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Options?
L536910	u2977	m195	LA FORGE	We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
L536942	u2982	m195	RIKER	It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
L536941	u2978	m195	NARA	Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
L536940	u2982	m195	RIKER	The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
L536918	u2982	m195	RIKER	Eject the core.
L536917	u2978	m195	NARA	The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
L536906	u2982	m195	RIKER	On screen.
L536905	u2978	m195	NARA	Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
L536875	u2982	m195	RIKER	Why not?
L536874	u2978	m195	NARA	I don't think they believe us.
L536950	u2982	m195	RIKER	Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
L536949	u2979	m195	PERIM	They're powering their forward weapons array.
L536925	u2982	m195	RIKER	We're through running from these bastards.
L536924	u2979	m195	PERIM	We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
L536908	u2982	m195	RIKER	Remind me to lodge a protest...
L536907	u2979	m195	PERIM	I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
L536901	u2982	m195	RIKER	Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
L536900	u2979	m195	PERIM	Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
L536899	u2982	m195	RIKER	What's inside that nebula cluster?
L536870	u2979	m195	PERIM	Eighteen minutes...
L536869	u2982	m195	RIKER	How long 'til they reach us?
L536868	u2979	m195	PERIM	Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
L537092	u2980	m195	PICARD	Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
L537091	u2982	m195	RIKER	The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
L536786	u2982	m195	RIKER	Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
L536785	u2980	m195	PICARD	There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
L536777	u2980	m195	PICARD	Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
L536776	u2982	m195	RIKER	You must be planning on doing some hunting.
L536767	u2982	m195	RIKER	Aye, sir.
L536766	u2980	m195	PICARD	Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
L536676	u2982	m195	RIKER	You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
L536675	u2980	m195	PICARD	Deck five.
L536674	u2980	m195	PICARD	We're not going anywhere.
L536673	u2982	m195	RIKER	Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
L536410	u2982	m195	RIKER	The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
L536409	u2980	m195	PICARD	So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
L536408	u2982	m195	RIKER	Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
L536407	u2980	m195	PICARD	We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
L536406	u2982	m195	RIKER	... and gorgonzolla cheese.
L536402	u2982	m195	RIKER	Commander Riker...
L536401	u2980	m195	PICARD	Who is it?
L536342	u2982	m195	RIKER	Deck ten.
L536341	u2980	m195	PICARD	'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
L536340	u2980	m195	PICARD	... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
L536339	u2982	m195	RIKER	The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
L536338	u2980	m195	PICARD	We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
L536337	u2982	m195	RIKER	They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
L537110	u2985	m195	SOJEF	I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
L537109	u2980	m195	PICARD	Ask them.
L537108	u2985	m195	SOJEF	I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
L536694	u2985	m195	SOJEF	Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
L536693	u2980	m195	PICARD	You've not aged a day since then?
L536692	u2985	m195	SOJEF	We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
L536533	u2985	m195	SOJEF	As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
L536532	u2980	m195	PICARD	No, we're here to... rescue them.
L536531	u2985	m195	SOJEF	Would you like something to eat?
L536530	u2980	m195	PICARD	Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
L536529	u2985	m195	SOJEF	My name is Sojef, Captain.
L536981	u2980	m195	PICARD	I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
L536980	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
L536979	u2980	m195	PICARD	Worf, you must hurry...
L536976	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	We're trying to get to you, sir...
L536975	u2980	m195	PICARD	Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
L536974	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	Worf to Picard...
L536449	u2980	m195	PICARD	We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
L536448	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
L536412	u2980	m195	PICARD	Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
L536411	u2989	m195	WORF'S COM VOICE	Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
L537099	u2980	m195	PICARD	Is there any other way to disable the injector?
L537098	u2988	m195	WORF	Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
L537097	u2980	m195	PICARD	Can you beam him off?
L537096	u2988	m195	WORF	One. It's Ru'afo.
L537075	u2980	m195	PICARD	Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
L537074	u2988	m195	WORF	All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
L536891	u2980	m195	PICARD	We have to find shelter...
L536890	u2988	m195	WORF	Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
L536861	u2980	m195	PICARD	Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
L536860	u2988	m195	WORF	The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
L536857	u2988	m195	WORF	Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
L536856	u2980	m195	PICARD	You need a haircut, Commander.
L536803	u2980	m195	PICARD	No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
L536802	u2988	m195	WORF	Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
L536678	u2980	m195	PICARD	Picard to Crusher...
L536677	u2988	m195	WORF	Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
L536669	u2980	m195	PICARD	Gorch?
L536668	u2988	m195	WORF	No, sir. It is a gorch.
L536667	u2980	m195	PICARD	Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
L536666	u2988	m195	WORF	No, sir...
L536665	u2980	m195	PICARD	Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
L536515	u2980	m195	PICARD	Transferring controls to manual.
L536514	u2988	m195	WORF	The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
L536510	u2980	m195	PICARD	I'm not letting go of him.
L536509	u2988	m195	WORF	Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
L536494	u2980	m195	PICARD	"They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  ""A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."""
L536493	u2988	m195	WORF	No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
L536492	u2980	m195	PICARD	Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
L536490	u2980	m195	PICARD	Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
L536489	u2988	m195	WORF	Scanners are off line!
L536487	u2980	m195	PICARD	Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
L536486	u2988	m195	WORF	He's activated a transport inhibitor.
L536485	u2980	m195	PICARD	Beam him out!
L536484	u2988	m195	WORF	Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
L536483	u2980	m195	PICARD	Make it so.
L536482	u2988	m195	WORF	Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
L536478	u2980	m195	PICARD	Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
L536477	u2988	m195	WORF	Sir?
L536476	u2980	m195	PICARD	Come out, come out wherever you are...
L536475	u2980	m195	PICARD	The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
L536474	u2988	m195	WORF	He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
L536473	u2980	m195	PICARD	Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
L536472	u2988	m195	WORF	Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
L536418	u2980	m195	PICARD	It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
L536417	u2988	m195	WORF	I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
L536353	u2980	m195	PICARD	Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
L536352	u2988	m195	WORF	Captain...
L536528	u2987	m195	TROI	They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
L536527	u2980	m195	PICARD	Counselor?
L536416	u2980	m195	PICARD	You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
L536415	u2987	m195	TROI	We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
L536332	u2980	m195	PICARD	Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
L536331	u2987	m195	TROI	Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
L536325	u2987	m195	TROI	Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
L536324	u2980	m195	PICARD	Say the greeting again...
L536323	u2987	m195	TROI	... Population three hundred million...
L536883	u2987	m195	TROI	And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
L536882	u2982	m195	RIKER	All hands. Battle stations!
L536575	u2987	m195	TROI	I never kissed you with a beard before.
L536574	u2982	m195	RIKER	Augh?
L536573	u2987	m195	TROI	Augh.
L536572	u2987	m195	TROI	On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
L536571	u2982	m195	RIKER	What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
L536570	u2987	m195	TROI	... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
L536569	u2982	m195	RIKER	... I'm not sleeping well...
L536568	u2987	m195	TROI	... I believe you...
L536567	u2982	m195	RIKER	Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
L536565	u2987	m195	TROI	You're in quite a mood today.
L536564	u2982	m195	RIKER	Or you could try lying down.
L536563	u2987	m195	TROI	Why don't you try sitting up?
L536562	u2982	m195	RIKER	But it's comfortable.
L536561	u2987	m195	TROI	This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
L536560	u2987	m195	TROI	Whatever makes you comfortable...
L536559	u2982	m195	RIKER	Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
L536558	u2987	m195	TROI	Come in.  Hi.
L536440	u2982	m195	RIKER	If that's true, they're a dying race.
L536439	u2987	m195	TROI	No children?
L536438	u2982	m195	RIKER	It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
L536437	u2987	m195	TROI	Was I doing something to your neck?
L536436	u2982	m195	RIKER	What you're doing to my neck...
L536435	u2987	m195	TROI	What...?
L536434	u2982	m195	RIKER	You haven't done that in a long time...
L536433	u2982	m195	RIKER	Good question.
L536432	u2987	m195	TROI	Why would we be involved with these people?
L536429	u2982	m195	RIKER	You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
L536428	u2987	m195	TROI	Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
L536427	u2982	m195	RIKER	Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
L536426	u2987	m195	TROI	You should feel right at home with them.
L536425	u2982	m195	RIKER	Wine, women and song.
L536424	u2987	m195	TROI	What are they interested in...?
L536423	u2982	m195	RIKER	I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
L536421	u2987	m195	TROI	Environmental concerns, again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
L536420	u2982	m195	RIKER	Why was Data assigned?
L536419	u2987	m195	TROI	The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
L537083	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
L537082	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
L537081	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
L537068	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	All ship functions are off-line.
L537067	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
L537066	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
L537065	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Exactly as the simulations predicted...
L537042	u2986	m195	SON'A OFFICER #2	Activating injector assembly.
L537041	u2984	m195	RU'AFO	Initiate launch sequence.
L540238	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	I look forward to reading your report.
L540237	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
L540236	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
L540235	u2997	m196	PICARD	Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
L539574	u2997	m196	PICARD	Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
L539573	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	Good hunting. Hayes out.
L539572	u2997	m196	PICARD	Absolutely.
L539571	u2990	m196	ADMIRAL HAYES	The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
L540019	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	"I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our ""sense of duty."" We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not."
L540018	u2997	m196	PICARD	Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
L540017	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
L540016	u2997	m196	PICARD	Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
L540013	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	That might not be so bad... at least for you.
L540012	u2997	m196	PICARD	If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
L540011	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	You think they're still up there?
L540010	u2997	m196	PICARD	Not yet.
L540009	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
L540008	u2997	m196	PICARD	How did Doctor Almack react to that?
L540007	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
L540006	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
L540005	u2997	m196	PICARD	You actually performed surgery...?
L539788	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
L539787	u2997	m196	PICARD	I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
L539774	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	That'll be interesting.
L539773	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
L539772	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
L539721	u2997	m196	PICARD	Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
L539720	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	There must be some good people... even in this time.
L539719	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
L539718	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Are you saying they won't help us?
L539717	u2997	m196	PICARD	It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
L539716	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	What are we waiting for? Let's go.
L539715	u2997	m196	PICARD	As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
L539714	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
L539713	u2997	m196	PICARD	It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
L539708	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
L539707	u2997	m196	PICARD	It's Cochrane.
L539661	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
L539660	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
L539659	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
L539658	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes...
L539657	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
L539656	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
L539655	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
L539651	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
L539650	u2997	m196	PICARD	Montana.  Energize.
L539906	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
L539905	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
L539761	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Bag him.
L539760	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
L539755	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
L539754	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
L539753	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Is it Japanese?
L539746	u2991	m196	BEVERLY	At least four hours.
L539745	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	How long has he been unconscious?
L540182	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Do it.
L540181	u2993	m196	DATA	I believe so.
L540180	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Can you configure it?
L540179	u2993	m196	DATA	The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
L540178	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
L540163	u2993	m196	DATA	No.
L540162	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Vulcan?
L540161	u2993	m196	DATA	There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
L540142	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
L540141	u2993	m196	DATA	No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
L540140	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
L540139	u2993	m196	DATA	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
L540138	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Isn't it better like this...?
L540136	u2993	m196	DATA	No... no, please... you cannot...
L540135	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
L540133	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
L540132	u2993	m196	DATA	Yes...
L540131	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
L540130	u2993	m196	DATA	I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
L540036	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	I'm your creator now.
L540035	u2993	m196	DATA	My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
L540034	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
L540033	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	More lies.
L540032	u2993	m196	DATA	I wish to... go back to the way I was.
L540031	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
L540030	u2993	m196	DATA	I... do not want this...
L540029	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
L540028	u2993	m196	DATA	That is not true. They have tried to help me.
L540027	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
L540026	u2993	m196	DATA	No. I will not betray my friends.
L539932	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
L539931	u2993	m196	DATA	It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
L539930	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Do you know what this is, Data?
L539929	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
L539928	u2993	m196	DATA	I do not know what you are referring to.
L539927	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
L539864	u2993	m196	DATA	It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
L539863	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
L539858	u2992	m196	BORG QUEEN	Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
L539857	u2993	m196	DATA	You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
L539637	u2993	m196	DATA	Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
L539636	u2997	m196	PICARD	Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
L539620	u2993	m196	DATA	According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
L539619	u2997	m196	PICARD	What year is it?
L539595	u2997	m196	PICARD	Contact Starfleet Command.
L539594	u2993	m196	DATA	The vortex is collapsing, sir.
L539592	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where's the Sphere?
L539591	u2993	m196	DATA	I have helm control.
L539578	u2997	m196	PICARD	What?
L539577	u2993	m196	DATA	It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
L539576	u2997	m196	PICARD	Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
L539575	u2993	m196	DATA	We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
L539555	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ready quantum torpedo.
L539554	u2993	m196	DATA	The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
L539550	u2997	m196	PICARD	Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
L539549	u2993	m196	DATA	Dispersive armor is holding.
L539856	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
L539855	u2993	m196	DATA	That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
L539854	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	I am the Borg.
L539853	u2993	m196	DATA	Who are you?
L539744	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
L539743	u2993	m196	DATA	I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
L539742	u3004	m196	WOMAN'S VOICE	But now... they are all one with the Borg.
L539670	u3003	m196	TROI	I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
L539669	u2993	m196	DATA	No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
L539668	u3003	m196	TROI	We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
L539667	u2993	m196	DATA	I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
L539666	u3003	m196	TROI	Data... are you sure you're all right?
L539665	u2993	m196	DATA	Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
L539664	u3003	m196	TROI	Did you know her?
L539602	u3003	m196	TROI	But how?
L539601	u2993	m196	DATA	The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
L539771	u2997	m196	PICARD	Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
L539770	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	What did you do to the batteries?
L539766	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
L539765	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where?
L539764	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	I told you, there's no --
L539763	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where's the battery room for the hospital?
L539757	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
L539756	u2997	m196	PICARD	Juice?
L539750	u2997	m196	PICARD	Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
L539749	u2994	m196	DOCTOR	APR cell count? What the hell are you talking about?
L540185	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're crossing the threshold!
L540184	u2995	m196	GEORDI	They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
L540174	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
L540173	u2997	m196	PICARD	Their com system must still be down.
L540172	u2997	m196	PICARD	Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
L540171	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain, the Enterprise!
L540170	u2997	m196	PICARD	One minute to warp threshold...
L540169	u2995	m196	GEORDI	There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
L540168	u2997	m196	PICARD	Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
L540167	u2995	m196	GEORDI	The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
L540166	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I'm on it...
L540165	u2997	m196	PICARD	Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
L540149	u2997	m196	PICARD	<U>Engage.</U>
L540148	u2995	m196	GEORDI	The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
L540147	u2997	m196	PICARD	Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
L540146	u2995	m196	GEORDI	The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
L540145	u2997	m196	PICARD	As they used to say... all systems are go.
L540144	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
L540127	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
L540126	u2997	m196	PICARD	There's a red light on the second intake valve.
L540125	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Entering the upper ionospere...
L540124	u2997	m196	PICARD	Altitude fifty kilometers...
L540123	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
L540097	u2997	m196	PICARD	Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
L540096	u2995	m196	GEORDI	What's still there?
L540095	u2997	m196	PICARD	Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
L540094	u2995	m196	GEORDI	No... the door's too thick.
L540092	u2997	m196	PICARD	It'll have to wait. Come on.
L540091	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
L540089	u2997	m196	PICARD	This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
L540088	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain --
L540070	u2997	m196	PICARD	She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
L540069	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
L540068	u2997	m196	PICARD	We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
L540064	u2997	m196	PICARD	Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
L540063	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Always am.
L540062	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ready to make a little history?
L539983	u2995	m196	GEORDI	They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
L539982	u2997	m196	PICARD	Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
L539851	u2997	m196	PICARD	If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
L539850	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
L539844	u2995	m196	GEORDI	We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
L539843	u2997	m196	PICARD	We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
L539842	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
L539841	u2997	m196	PICARD	Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
L539840	u2995	m196	GEORDI	This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
L539710	u2995	m196	GEORDI	It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
L539709	u2997	m196	PICARD	Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
L539701	u2997	m196	PICARD	There should be some kind of manual release...
L539700	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
L539695	u2997	m196	PICARD	I have the password right here.
L539694	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
L539692	u2997	m196	PICARD	There should be an access hatch nearby...
L539691	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
L539689	u2997	m196	PICARD	Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
L539688	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
L539687	u2997	m196	PICARD	How serious is the damage?
L539686	u2995	m196	GEORDI	This must be it.
L539654	u2997	m196	PICARD	Let's go.
L539653	u2995	m196	GEORDI	I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
L539560	u2997	m196	PICARD	Understood. Keep me informed.
L539559	u2995	m196	GEORDI	Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
L540057	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
L540056	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Ready.
L540055	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	Main bus...
L540054	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Active.
L540053	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	ATR setting...
L539991	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
L539990	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
L539989	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
L539988	u2996	m196	GEORDI'S VOICE	It'll be tight, but we should make it.
L539987	u2998	m196	PICARD'S VOICE	Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
L540112	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
L540111	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
L540110	u2997	m196	PICARD	From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
L540107	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
L540106	u2997	m196	PICARD	There is no invasion...
L540102	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	"These people you're calling ""Vulcans""... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?"
L540101	u2997	m196	PICARD	Invasion.
L540100	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	The invasion plans.
L540099	u2997	m196	PICARD	What do you want?
L539817	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Not yet.
L539816	u2997	m196	PICARD	Something wrong with that?
L539815	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	You seem to have an answer for everything.
L539814	u2997	m196	PICARD	I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
L539813	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
L539812	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes.
L539811	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
L539810	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
L539809	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
L539808	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Huh.
L539807	u2997	m196	PICARD	It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
L539806	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
L539805	u2997	m196	PICARD	There's a few of us left.
L539804	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
L539803	u2997	m196	PICARD	California. San Francisco.
L539802	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Where are you from most recently?
L539801	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
L539800	u2997	m196	PICARD	Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
L539799	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Where in the States?
L539797	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	You don't sound French.
L539796	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes.
L539795	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Great name. French?
L539794	u2997	m196	PICARD	Jean-Luc Picard.
L539793	u3002	m196	SCRIMM	Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
L539792	u2997	m196	PICARD	Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
L540217	u3001	m196	RUBY	You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
L540216	u2997	m196	PICARD	This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
L540215	u3001	m196	RUBY	Why?
L540214	u2997	m196	PICARD	That's impossible.
L540213	u3001	m196	RUBY	I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
L540212	u2997	m196	PICARD	No... I'm from France.
L540211	u3001	m196	RUBY	It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
L540210	u2997	m196	PICARD	No. It's a lot further than that.
L540209	u3001	m196	RUBY	Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
L540208	u2997	m196	PICARD	I have to...
L540207	u3001	m196	RUBY	You're leaving, aren't you?
L539955	u2997	m196	PICARD	I am not a thief...
L539954	u3001	m196	RUBY	And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
L539953	u2997	m196	PICARD	Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
L539950	u3001	m196	RUBY	Or...?
L539949	u2997	m196	PICARD	We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
L539948	u3001	m196	RUBY	All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
L539947	u2997	m196	PICARD	A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
L539946	u3001	m196	RUBY	Lie. That's one. Keep going.
L539945	u2997	m196	PICARD	Some.
L539944	u3001	m196	RUBY	Friends from Cornell...
L539943	u2997	m196	PICARD	Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
L539942	u3001	m196	RUBY	We?
L539941	u2997	m196	PICARD	We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
L539940	u3001	m196	RUBY	Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
L539939	u3001	m196	RUBY	Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
L539938	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'd say you already have.
L539917	u3001	m196	RUBY	Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
L539916	u2997	m196	PICARD	It can't wait until tomorrow...
L539915	u3001	m196	RUBY	I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
L539914	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
L539909	u2997	m196	PICARD	How did you know about that?
L539908	u3001	m196	RUBY	No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
L539907	u2997	m196	PICARD	Were the two of you... involved?
L539903	u2997	m196	PICARD	Are you always sucha good judge of character?
L539902	u3001	m196	RUBY	You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
L539901	u2997	m196	PICARD	What makes you say that?
L539900	u3001	m196	RUBY	You're lying.
L539899	u2997	m196	PICARD	What?
L539898	u3001	m196	RUBY	'Fraid not.
L539897	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
L539896	u3001	m196	RUBY	Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
L539895	u2997	m196	PICARD	No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
L539894	u3001	m196	RUBY	You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
L539893	u2997	m196	PICARD	I can try.
L539892	u3001	m196	RUBY	Money. So you can get dome money...
L539889	u2997	m196	PICARD	Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
L539888	u3001	m196	RUBY	Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
L539887	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
L539886	u3001	m196	RUBY	Did you need something?
L539884	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'm very sorry.
L539883	u3001	m196	RUBY	Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
L539882	u2997	m196	PICARD	Cochrane?
L539881	u3001	m196	RUBY	Thank God this plate was already fixed.
L539880	u2997	m196	PICARD	Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
L539879	u3001	m196	RUBY	What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
L539780	u2997	m196	PICARD	Yes, he is.
L539779	u3001	m196	RUBY	Take care of him. He's a very special man.
L539626	u3003	m196	TROI	Western hemisphere... North American continent...
L539625	u2997	m196	PICARD	Track their weapons fire.
L539610	u2997	m196	PICARD	We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
L539609	u3003	m196	TROI	Captain...?
L539600	u3003	m196	TROI	Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
L539599	u2997	m196	PICARD	Life signs?
L539562	u2997	m196	PICARD	On screen.
L539561	u3003	m196	TROI	Incoming transmission from the Borg.
L539548	u3003	m196	TROI	Aye, sir.
L539547	u2997	m196	PICARD	Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
L540234	u2997	m196	PICARD	Onscreen.
L540233	u3005	m196	WORF	Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
L539642	u3005	m196	WORF	Aye, sir.
L539641	u2997	m196	PICARD	Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
L539635	u2997	m196	PICARD	Fire!
L539634	u3005	m196	WORF	Target locked!
L539624	u2997	m196	PICARD	Go to manual.
L539623	u3005	m196	WORF	Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
L539622	u2997	m196	PICARD	Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
L539621	u3005	m196	WORF	Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
L539613	u2997	m196	PICARD	Steady as she goes.
L539612	u3005	m196	WORF	Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
L539608	u2997	m196	PICARD	Data, set a course for that vortex.
L539607	u3005	m196	WORF	Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
L539584	u3005	m196	WORF	Aye, sir.
L539583	u2997	m196	PICARD	Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
L539552	u2997	m196	PICARD	Fire.
L539551	u3005	m196	WORF	Port battery, ready sir!
L540231	u2999	m196	RIKER	No, sir.
L540230	u2997	m196	PICARD	Unless you'd like to stay.
L540229	u2999	m196	RIKER	Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
L540228	u2997	m196	PICARD	Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
L540227	u2999	m196	RIKER	Yes, sir.
L540226	u2997	m196	PICARD	Return to our own time?
L539648	u2997	m196	PICARD	I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
L539647	u2999	m196	RIKER	Good luck, sir.
L539646	u2997	m196	PICARD	Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
L539645	u2999	m196	RIKER	And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
L539644	u2997	m196	PICARD	In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
L539643	u2999	m196	RIKER	Captain?
L539640	u2999	m196	RIKER	Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
L539639	u2997	m196	PICARD	Life signs?
L539638	u2999	m196	RIKER	Looks like they damaged the silo...
L539618	u2997	m196	PICARD	On screen.
L539617	u2999	m196	RIKER	We're still in Earth orbit.
L539616	u2997	m196	PICARD	Report.
L539604	u2999	m196	RIKER	They did it... they assimilated Earth.
L539603	u2997	m196	PICARD	They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
L539590	u2997	m196	PICARD	Worf... torpedo... now!
L539589	u2999	m196	RIKER	We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
L540158	u3005	m196	WORF	Nothing.
L540157	u2999	m196	RIKER	Emergency override!
L540156	u3005	m196	WORF	We've lost Bridge control!
L540155	u2999	m196	RIKER	Report!
L540052	u3005	m196	WORF	Understood!
L540051	u2999	m196	RIKER	Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
L540049	u2999	m196	RIKER	I'll keep that in mind.
L540048	u3005	m196	WORF	And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
L540047	u2999	m196	RIKER	Right.
L540046	u3005	m196	WORF	Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
L540045	u2999	m196	RIKER	Just a little queasy...
L540044	u3005	m196	WORF	Are you alright?
L540039	u3005	m196	WORF	The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
L540038	u2999	m196	RIKER	I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
L540037	u3005	m196	WORF	You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
L539974	u3005	m196	WORF	Destroy the deflector dish.
L539973	u2999	m196	RIKER	Agreed. Options?
L539972	u3005	m196	WORF	We have to stop them from sending that message.
L539968	u3005	m196	WORF	They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
L539967	u2999	m196	RIKER	They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
L539966	u2999	m196	RIKER	Computer -- thermal enhancement.
L539965	u3005	m196	WORF	They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
L539960	u3005	m196	WORF	They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
L539959	u2999	m196	RIKER	What are they doing?
L539877	u2999	m196	RIKER	We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
L539876	u3005	m196	WORF	To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
L539871	u2999	m196	RIKER	We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
L539870	u3005	m196	WORF	We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
L539733	u3005	m196	WORF	It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
L539732	u2999	m196	RIKER	What the hell is happening, Worf?
L539730	u2999	m196	RIKER	What?
L539729	u3005	m196	WORF	A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
L539723	u2999	m196	RIKER	Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
L539722	u3005	m196	WORF	I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
L539569	u3005	m196	WORF	Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
L539568	u2999	m196	RIKER	Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
L540153	u2999	m196	RIKER	Hold that thought.
L540152	u3003	m196	TROI	I have to admit there was a moment there when --
L539980	u2999	m196	RIKER	I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
L539979	u3003	m196	TROI	What are you suggesting?
L539978	u2999	m196	RIKER	I remember it made me sick.
L539962	u2999	m196	RIKER	Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
L539961	u3003	m196	TROI	To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
L539925	u2999	m196	RIKER	Where the hell are they going?
L539924	u3003	m196	TROI	They're bypassing Engineering...
L539869	u3003	m196	TROI	Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
L539868	u2999	m196	RIKER	All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
L539737	u2999	m196	RIKER	Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
L539736	u3003	m196	TROI	Wil... Data was down there.
L539735	u2999	m196	RIKER	The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
L539734	u3003	m196	TROI	Someone...?
L539728	u3003	m196	TROI	We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
L539727	u2999	m196	RIKER	Report.
L539838	u3005	m196	WORF	Commander... we have a problem.
L539837	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	What the hell happened down there, Worf?
L539832	u3005	m196	WORF	Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
L539831	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Worf? Is something wrong?
L539828	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
L539827	u3005	m196	WORF	Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
L539824	u3005	m196	WORF	There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
L539823	u3000	m196	RIKER'S COM VOICE	Riker here.
L539822	u3005	m196	WORF	Worf to Bridge.
L539970	u3005	m196	WORF	What kind of message?
L539969	u3003	m196	TROI	They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
L539873	u3005	m196	WORF	Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
L539872	u3003	m196	TROI	Even Data?
L539725	u3005	m196	WORF	There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
L539724	u3003	m196	TROI	Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
L539632	u3005	m196	WORF	Target...
L539631	u3003	m196	TROI	Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
L539597	u3003	m196	TROI	Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
L539596	u3005	m196	WORF	No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
L542546	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
L542545	u3038	m199	BENNY	I don't think so... 
L542544	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
L542533	u3047	m199	OFFICER	No, we can handle this.
L542532	u3038	m199	BENNY	Don't you think you should call a backup?
L542530	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Probably kids.
L542529	u3038	m199	BENNY	What did I tell you?
L542526	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
L542525	u3038	m199	BENNY	There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
L542524	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Benny, there's nothing there.
L542523	u3038	m199	BENNY	It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
L542522	u3047	m199	OFFICER	I don't see anything.
L542521	u3038	m199	BENNY	Right in line with that burning tree.
L542517	u3038	m199	BENNY	I don't want to scare them away.
L542516	u3047	m199	OFFICER	Benny, God, take it easy...
L543352	u3039	m199	CLERK	We should have. Let me see.
L543351	u3043	m199	JENNY	Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
L543094	u3039	m199	CLERK	It's still the full price.
L543093	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're only going to be here a few hours...
L543092	u3039	m199	CLERK	I'll have to run your card off now.
L543091	u3043	m199	JENNY	Credit card.
L543090	u3039	m199	CLERK	Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
L543089	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'll take that.
L543088	u3039	m199	CLERK	Sure.
L543087	u3043	m199	JENNY	You have one with two beds?
L543086	u3039	m199	CLERK	Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
L543085	u3043	m199	JENNY	How much are your rooms?
L543084	u3039	m199	CLERK	What can I do for you folks?
L542956	u3039	m199	CLERK	Have a nice trip.
L542955	u3043	m199	JENNY	Thank you.
L542954	u3039	m199	CLERK	Gate three. It's boarding now.
L543242	u3040	m199	COOK	And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
L543241	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Thank you.
L543240	u3040	m199	COOK	Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
L543182	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It is beautiful.
L543181	u3040	m199	COOK	What do you think of America?
L543180	u3040	m199	COOK	They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything.
L543179	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543178	u3040	m199	COOK	Do you have children?
L543173	u3040	m199	COOK	You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
L543172	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543171	u3040	m199	COOK	Make any money?
L543170	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Eh... yes.
L543169	u3040	m199	COOK	Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
L543168	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I make maps.
L543167	u3040	m199	COOK	What do you do?
L543166	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543165	u3040	m199	COOK	Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
L543152	u3041	m199	DRIVER	About five miles back.
L543151	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where's that?
L543150	u3041	m199	DRIVER	Elmo's...
L543149	u3043	m199	JENNY	What was your last stop?
L543148	u3041	m199	DRIVER	Stay right there...
L543147	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where did you stop last?
L543146	u3041	m199	DRIVER	What the hell do you think you're doing?
L543145	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where did you stop last?
L543117	u3041	m199	DRIVER	He's got a gun!!
L543116	u3043	m199	JENNY	No!!! No!!!
L542621	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	They must have picked it up in space.
L542620	u3042	m199	FOX	Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
L542619	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
L542618	u3042	m199	FOX	Recognize this?
L542590	u3042	m199	FOX	Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
L542589	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
L542588	u3042	m199	FOX	We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
L543433	u3042	m199	FOX	Shermin!! Shermin!!!
L543432	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I just retired.
L543431	u3042	m199	FOX	What?
L543430	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	George... Do you hear me, George?
L543413	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I'm afraid we can't let you go.
L543412	u3042	m199	FOX	No deal.
L543347	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
L543346	u3042	m199	FOX	You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
L543345	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Then you're going to have to do it without me.
L543344	u3042	m199	FOX	No, we don't.
L543343	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	That's the chance we have to take.
L543342	u3042	m199	FOX	We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
L543341	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
L543340	u3042	m199	FOX	You're not hearing me.
L543339	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
L543338	u3042	m199	FOX	Washington thinks it's too late for that.
L543337	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
L543336	u3042	m199	FOX	We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
L543335	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	What's all this for?
L543334	u3042	m199	FOX	Shermin...
L543333	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Hello George.
L543140	u3042	m199	FOX	You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
L543139	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
L543138	u3042	m199	FOX	Is that what's affecting your performance?
L543137	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
L543136	u3042	m199	FOX	So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
L543135	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
L543134	u3042	m199	FOX	I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
L543133	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
L543132	u3042	m199	FOX	We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
L542889	u3042	m199	FOX	I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
L542888	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
L542887	u3042	m199	FOX	We don't know what else to do. We need results.
L542886	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
L542885	u3042	m199	FOX	Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
L542884	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I don't like it, George...
L542883	u3042	m199	FOX	I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
L542882	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
L542756	u3042	m199	FOX	Oh shit!!!
L542755	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
L542753	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
L542752	u3042	m199	FOX	Clarify that.
L542751	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's taken on a disguise.
L542750	u3042	m199	FOX	Why did you let it get into a populated area?
L542747	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
L542746	u3042	m199	FOX	It's in a green Mustang?
L542745	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
L542744	u3042	m199	FOX	When can we expect containment?
L542743	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
L542629	u3042	m199	FOX	You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
L542628	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
L542627	u3042	m199	FOX	We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
L542626	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
L542625	u3042	m199	FOX	We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
L542624	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
L542623	u3042	m199	FOX	We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
L542622	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Then it's not an accident that they found us.
L542595	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	What do you mean by 'contain?'
L542594	u3042	m199	FOX	Contain it and get back to me.
L542593	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
L542592	u3042	m199	FOX	I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
L542591	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
L542587	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Neither did I.
L542586	u3042	m199	FOX	Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
L542585	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
L542584	u3042	m199	FOX	Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
L542583	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
L542582	u3042	m199	FOX	There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
L542581	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It's real, George.
L543428	u3042	m199	FOX	Watch it. They're coming out.
L543427	u3043	m199	JENNY	I won't let anyone hurt you.
L543402	u3042	m199	FOX	Okay...
L543401	u3043	m199	JENNY	If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
L543400	u3042	m199	FOX	You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
L543399	u3043	m199	JENNY	I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
L543398	u3042	m199	FOX	This is George Fox...
L543397	u3042	m199	FOX	Mrs. Haydn...
L543224	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
L543223	u3043	m199	JENNY	He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
L543222	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Mrs. Haydn...
L543221	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
L543220	u3043	m199	JENNY	Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
L543219	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Marc Shermin.
L543218	u3043	m199	JENNY	Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
L543215	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Get a highway patrol unit over there.
L543214	u3043	m199	JENNY	I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
L543213	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
L543211	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
L543210	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
L543209	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
L543208	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
L543447	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Goodbye.
L543446	u3043	m199	JENNY	I will.
L543445	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Tell the baby about me.
L543443	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543442	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
L543441	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I love you.
L543440	u3043	m199	JENNY	You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
L543439	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What do I do now?
L543438	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I must go.
L543437	u3043	m199	JENNY	Well...
L543417	u3043	m199	JENNY	I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
L543416	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
L543415	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where do you think you're going?
L543393	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will wave to you.
L543392	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
L543391	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The yellow one.
L543390	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where?
L543389	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	There.
L543386	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No, thank you.
L543385	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
L543383	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Many, many days and nights...
L543382	u3043	m199	JENNY	How long will it take you to get home?
L543381	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L543380	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You want the baby to laugh at me.
L543379	u3043	m199	JENNY	Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
L543378	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'd like to...
L543377	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	If you want to keep it, you can.
L543376	u3043	m199	JENNY	This is yours...
L543375	u3043	m199	JENNY	We can.
L543374	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will say that we can be friends.
L543373	u3043	m199	JENNY	What will you say about us?
L543372	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
L543371	u3043	m199	JENNY	It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
L543370	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543369	u3043	m199	JENNY	Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
L543368	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
L543367	u3043	m199	JENNY	It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
L543366	u3043	m199	JENNY	If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
L543365	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L543364	u3043	m199	JENNY	The cook again?
L543363	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
L543362	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
L543361	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I want to get money for you and the baby.
L543360	u3043	m199	JENNY	You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
L543359	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I know how to gamble now.
L543358	u3043	m199	JENNY	This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
L543357	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.  Thank you.
L543356	u3043	m199	JENNY	Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
L543355	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I want to gamble.
L543354	u3043	m199	JENNY	What for?
L543353	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	May I have twenty-five cents, please?
L543350	u3043	m199	JENNY	You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
L543349	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
L543331	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
L543330	u3043	m199	JENNY	I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
L543329	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
L543328	u3043	m199	JENNY	But...
L543327	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
L543326	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes, they are.
L543325	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	They are beautiful.
L543324	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I gave you a baby last night.
L543323	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh, you're pretty...
L543322	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543321	u3043	m199	JENNY	No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
L543320	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Do they talk?!
L543319	u3043	m199	JENNY	Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
L543318	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543317	u3043	m199	JENNY	You don't forget anything, do you?
L543316	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Horses.
L543315	u3043	m199	JENNY	Good morning.
L543314	u3043	m199	JENNY	Nothing.
L543313	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L543309	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not get cold.
L543308	u3043	m199	JENNY	You're damn right I am.
L543307	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You are cold.
L543305	u3043	m199	JENNY	We'll get a ride in the morning.
L543304	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
L543303	u3043	m199	JENNY	Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
L543302	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
L543301	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
L543299	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
L543298	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You can stop. I will go on alone.
L543297	u3043	m199	JENNY	What are you saying?
L543296	u3043	m199	JENNY	What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
L543295	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You promised.
L543294	u3043	m199	JENNY	I will. I will. We still have another day.
L543293	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You promised you would get me to my ship.
L543292	u3043	m199	JENNY	No one's traveling in this weather.
L543291	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I can't stay on this planet.
L543290	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're not going to get a ride tonight.
L543289	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The cook.
L543288	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where did you learn that?
L543287	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Asshole!!
L543285	u3043	m199	JENNY	We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
L543284	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I feel better if I move.
L543283	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why can't we wait here for a ride?
L543282	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I must meet my ship.
L543281	u3043	m199	JENNY	Where are you going?
L543275	u3043	m199	JENNY	Come on.
L543274	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't want you to be hurt.
L543273	u3043	m199	JENNY	You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
L543272	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will go. But not you.
L543271	u3043	m199	JENNY	Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
L543270	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
L543269	u3043	m199	JENNY	The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
L543268	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
L543267	u3043	m199	JENNY	The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
L543266	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
L543113	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
L543112	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Are you angry at me?
L543111	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
L543110	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You can have one.
L543109	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. Get in.
L543108	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
L543107	u3043	m199	JENNY	Hurry up.
L543106	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	On the radio they say it's good.
L543105	u3043	m199	JENNY	You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
L543097	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
L543096	u3043	m199	JENNY	Put that back.
L543083	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes. Sing some more.
L543082	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You liked my singing?
L543081	u3043	m199	JENNY	That was beautiful.
L543080	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I am not a good singer.
L543078	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
L543077	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not want to.
L543076	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
L543075	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L543074	u3043	m199	JENNY	Do you have music up there?
L543073	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
L543072	u3043	m199	JENNY	I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
L543071	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I like this music.
L543070	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't know.
L543069	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Why?
L543068	u3043	m199	JENNY	Nobody knows.
L543065	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I am your friend.
L543064	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L543063	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Are you my friend?
L543062	u3043	m199	JENNY	What are you doing?
L543061	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	He will.
L543060	u3043	m199	JENNY	It's bad.
L543059	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What is hell?
L543058	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
L543057	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I understand.
L543056	u3043	m199	JENNY	The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
L543055	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
L543054	u3043	m199	JENNY	A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
L543053	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't understand 'friend.'
L543052	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
L543051	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
L543050	u3043	m199	JENNY	The captain...
L543049	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
L543048	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L543047	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes?
L543046	u3043	m199	JENNY	You did? That's funny. So did we.
L543045	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
L543044	u3043	m199	JENNY	Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
L543043	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
L543042	u3043	m199	JENNY	You thought we were a different planet?!
L543041	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It was a mistake.
L543040	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
L543015	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I was afraid.
L543014	u3043	m199	JENNY	What happened?
L543011	u3043	m199	JENNY	It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
L543010	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L543009	u3043	m199	JENNY	Goodbye.
L543005	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Please stay.
L543004	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes?
L543003	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Jennyhaydn.
L543002	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Goodbye.
L543001	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
L543000	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Go?
L542999	u3043	m199	JENNY	Well... I'm going to go now.
L542998	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L542997	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
L542995	u3043	m199	JENNY	No.
L542994	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Can I have the gun?
L542993	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
L542991	u3043	m199	JENNY	Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
L542990	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
L542989	u3043	m199	JENNY	Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
L542988	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	The car will stop?
L542987	u3043	m199	JENNY	Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
L542986	u3043	m199	JENNY	You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
L542985	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
L542982	u3043	m199	JENNY	Then don't be smart.
L542981	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L542980	u3043	m199	JENNY	You want this ticket?
L542979	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
L542978	u3043	m199	JENNY	Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
L542977	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not speak English.
L542976	u3043	m199	JENNY	Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
L542975	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	But I speak English.
L542974	u3043	m199	JENNY	The driver will...
L542973	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
L542972	u3043	m199	JENNY	Say it.
L542971	u3043	m199	JENNY	That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
L542970	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What is hitchhike?
L542969	u3043	m199	JENNY	I know that. But the buses don't go there.
L542968	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	But I must go here.
L542967	u3043	m199	JENNY	I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
L542966	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Why?
L542965	u3043	m199	JENNY	I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
L542964	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Why?
L542963	u3043	m199	JENNY	No... The closest...
L542962	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Do you have a baby?
L542961	u3043	m199	JENNY	Eh... yes...
L542960	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	A baby is a new person?
L542959	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L542958	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Is that a baby?
L542957	u3043	m199	JENNY	The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
L542930	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	When we get here.
L542929	u3043	m199	JENNY	Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
L542928	u3043	m199	JENNY	I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
L542927	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542926	u3043	m199	JENNY	Then let me go. You don't need me.
L542925	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542924	u3043	m199	JENNY	You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
L542923	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542922	u3043	m199	JENNY	I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
L542921	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I need you.
L542920	u3043	m199	JENNY	That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
L542919	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Three nights... two days.
L542918	u3043	m199	JENNY	How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
L542917	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes. Day... night.
L542916	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
L542915	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Yes.
L542914	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sun...
L542913	u3043	m199	JENNY	How will I do this one?...
L542912	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I do not understand.
L542911	u3043	m199	JENNY	When do you have to be here?
L542910	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
L542909	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why are you going here? What is here?
L542908	u3043	m199	JENNY	You better.
L542907	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I will see it next time.
L542906	u3043	m199	JENNY	You didn't even see it.
L542905	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	It was yellow.
L542904	u3043	m199	JENNY	That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
L542878	u3043	m199	JENNY	Music.
L542877	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L542876	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Horses.
L542875	u3043	m199	JENNY	Horses.
L542867	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Shit!
L542866	u3043	m199	JENNY	What's the matter?
L542863	u3043	m199	JENNY	This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
L542862	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I want to try it.
L542861	u3043	m199	JENNY	You want to try it?
L542860	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I...
L542859	u3043	m199	JENNY	A drink.
L542858	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What is...  ...Coke?
L542852	u3043	m199	JENNY	Candy.
L542851	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L542850	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes.
L542849	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Money.
L542834	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542833	u3043	m199	JENNY	Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
L542826	u3043	m199	JENNY	Okay.
L542825	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	You. Mouth closed.
L542824	u3043	m199	JENNY	In your pocket, please...
L542822	u3043	m199	JENNY	Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
L542821	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L542820	u3043	m199	JENNY	Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
L542819	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Who?
L542816	u3043	m199	JENNY	Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
L542815	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Shit... shit... what shit?
L542814	u3043	m199	JENNY	No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
L542813	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Shit?
L542812	u3043	m199	JENNY	Shit.
L542811	u3043	m199	JENNY	No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
L542810	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I am husband?
L542809	u3043	m199	JENNY	My... husband.
L542808	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Who?
L542807	u3043	m199	JENNY	I know.
L542806	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No gas.
L542805	u3043	m199	JENNY	Closed.
L542804	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Gas.
L542803	u3043	m199	JENNY	Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
L542802	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Space?
L542801	u3043	m199	JENNY	Are you from up there? Space?
L542800	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	From?
L542799	u3043	m199	JENNY	That's a big help. Where are you from?
L542798	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I am...
L542797	u3043	m199	JENNY	Who are you?
L542796	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Jennyhaydn.
L542795	u3043	m199	JENNY	I am Jenny Haydn.
L542794	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
L542793	u3043	m199	JENNY	Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
L542792	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What?
L542791	u3043	m199	JENNY	You'll see.
L542790	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Closed?
L542789	u3043	m199	JENNY	It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
L542788	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Go.
L542786	u3043	m199	JENNY	Yes. Very good.
L542785	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Gas good?
L542784	u3043	m199	JENNY	No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
L542777	u3043	m199	JENNY	This car runs on gas.
L542776	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No gas.
L542775	u3043	m199	JENNY	No gas.

L542663	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Ah no.
L542662	u3043	m199	JENNY	Ah... no...
L542661	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	What.
L542660	u3043	m199	JENNY	What?
L542653	u3043	m199	JENNY	Which way do you want to go?
L542652	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Please...
L542651	u3043	m199	JENNY	Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
L542650	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Please.
L542646	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't... don't do this... please...
L542645	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Please...
L542702	u3043	m199	JENNY	He doesn't understand... just walk away...
L542701	u3046	m199	MAN	Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
L542700	u3046	m199	MAN	Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
L542699	u3043	m199	JENNY	Help me!!!
L542698	u3046	m199	MAN	Hey buddy... let her go...
L542697	u3043	m199	JENNY	Call the police!!
L542696	u3046	m199	MAN	Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
L542695	u3043	m199	JENNY	He's kidnapping me!!!
L542694	u3046	m199	MAN	You could have killed us both!!
L542693	u3043	m199	JENNY	Help me!!
L543264	u3043	m199	JENNY	Don't worry. I'll be all right.
L543263	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
L543262	u3043	m199	JENNY	Sure.
L543261	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Wait. Could I have your autograph?
L543260	u3043	m199	JENNY	It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
L543259	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
L543258	u3043	m199	JENNY	Pull over. I've got to get back there.
L543257	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
L543256	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Fly.
L543255	u3043	m199	JENNY	If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
L543254	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
L543239	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
L543238	u3043	m199	JENNY	What? No, of course not.
L543237	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	They after you?
L543236	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
L543235	u3043	m199	JENNY	I don't know where he is.
L543234	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	In the cars, too?!
L543233	u3043	m199	JENNY	I told you I'm looking for someone.
L543232	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
L543231	u3043	m199	JENNY	Slow down, slow down.
L543230	u3051	m199	TEENAGER	My grandmother's rich.
L543229	u3043	m199	JENNY	You sure this is your car?
L543249	u3044	m199	LYMAN	We're ready.
L543248	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You get that, Lyman?
L543130	u3044	m199	LYMAN	I did.
L543129	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Tell him I'm not here.
L543039	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
L543038	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Doesn't make sense.
L543037	u3044	m199	LYMAN	I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
L542899	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
L542898	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
L542897	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
L542612	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
L542611	u3044	m199	LYMAN	That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
L542609	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Give it a rest, Lyman.
L542608	u3044	m199	LYMAN	This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
L542602	u3044	m199	LYMAN	I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
L542601	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
L542580	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Get Fox.
L542579	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Is it for real?
L542895	u3044	m199	LYMAN	You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
L542894	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	You have no conception of this, do you?
L542893	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Bullshit!
L542892	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
L542891	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Save us all a lot of trouble.
L542890	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
L542604	u3044	m199	LYMAN	Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
L542603	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
L542723	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
L542722	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
L542720	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	The police think he was high on drugs...
L542719	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It was a man though... right?
L542718	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
L542717	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
L542716	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
L542715	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
L542714	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Yes.
L542713	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	To the same woman?
L542712	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Twenty-eight years.
L542711	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You married, Major?
L542710	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I know, but...
L542709	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	It was only an accident that we discovered them.
L542708	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
L542573	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	We better get it into the box. Come on...
L542572	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Oh, Jesus.
L542570	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
L542569	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	People have made mistakes in these situations before.
L542568	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
L542567	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	It could have been anything.
L542566	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	No, sir. Radar.
L542565	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Was there visual contact?
L542564	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
L542563	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Wait'll you see it.
L542562	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
L542561	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	No.
L542560	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Can you see under the faceplate?
L542559	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
L542558	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
L542557	u3045	m199	MAJOR BELL	Very beautiful country up here...
L542556	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	This has always been my favorite time of day.
L543164	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	No.
L543163	u3046	m199	MAN	I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
L543162	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't understand.
L543161	u3046	m199	MAN	Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
L543160	u3046	m199	MAN	Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
L543159	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't understand.
L543156	u3046	m199	MAN	Hop in.
L543155	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
L543154	u3046	m199	MAN	Where are you going?
L542734	u3046	m199	MAN	Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
L542733	u3052	m199	WOMAN	I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
L542732	u3046	m199	MAN	You know that's impossible!
L542731	u3052	m199	WOMAN	Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
L542730	u3046	m199	MAN	Judy, that's stupid.
L542729	u3052	m199	WOMAN	I told you...
L543036	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
L543035	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
L543034	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	I wouldn't think so.
L543033	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
L543032	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
L543031	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	You saw that?
L543030	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
L543029	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
L543028	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
L543027	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
L543026	u3048	m199	SECURITY GUARD	Is there a reward in this?
L543411	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
L543410	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
L543409	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
L543408	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
L543407	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	We can't let you do that.
L543406	u3050	m199	STAR MAN	I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
L543405	u3049	m199	SHERMIN	Hello...
L577142	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
L577141	u3141	m206	CARLA	Don't stop...  do no stop.
L577059	u3141	m206	CARLA	Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
L577058	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Stick with Carla.
L577057	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona= Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.
L577056	u3141	m206	CARLA	You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
L577055	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Hey!  Now there's some good news.
L577054	u3141	m206	CARLA	That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
L577053	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Could we change the subject?
L577052	u3141	m206	CARLA	You know how I feel about what you do.
L577051	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Not really.
L577050	u3141	m206	CARLA	You want to talk about it?
L577049	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Had a close one.
L577790	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
L577789	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
L577525	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
L577524	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	He's got a gun, sir.
L577523	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	Don't let him do that.
L577522	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	He says he's leaving the island sir.
L577521	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	What is happening?  Where's Mason?
L577520	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	It's me sir.
L577402	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	MY girlfriend's pregnant.
L577401	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	Spit it out.
L577398	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	"I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, ""Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work."" Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus..."
L577397	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
L577396	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Thank you.
L577209	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
L577208	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	Maybe.  Not really.
L577206	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
L577205	u3144	m206	SANCHEZ	No.
L577801	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	What's that?  Mason?
L577800	u3143	m206	MASON	St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
L577798	u3143	m206	MASON	Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
L577797	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	God's speed.
L577795	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
L577794	u3143	m206	MASON	I'm not a fool, Billy.
L577793	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	You knew?  All this time?
L577792	u3143	m206	MASON	Womack ripped it up, right?
L577791	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
L577728	u3143	m206	MASON	Partners.
L577727	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Partners?
L577673	u3143	m206	MASON	An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
L577672	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
L577671	u3143	m206	MASON	Surprise, surprise.
L577668	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	The cell, Mason.
L577667	u3143	m206	MASON	You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
L577663	u3143	m206	MASON	It's about time.
L577662	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Mason.  Mason?
L577627	u3143	m206	MASON	Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
L577626	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Wait.
L577623	u3143	m206	MASON	Now they only have three rockets left.
L577622	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	What are you doing?
L577620	u3143	m206	MASON	I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
L577619	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	What, vou?
L577618	u3143	m206	MASON	Wrong.
L577617	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	I'll go.
L577599	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	It's all I could think of.
L577598	u3143	m206	MASON	Limp dick?
L577558	u3143	m206	MASON	No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
L577557	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
L577515	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Wait.  Where're you going?
L577514	u3143	m206	MASON	For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
L577513	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
L577428	u3143	m206	MASON	For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
L577427	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Motor oil?
L577312	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
L577311	u3143	m206	MASON	John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
L577237	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Yes.  You'll be outside.
L577236	u3143	m206	MASON	You suppose?
L577235	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	Well yes I suppose ...
L577234	u3143	m206	MASON	During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
L577233	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	I don't understand....
L577226	u3143	m206	MASON	Tell me what you really do.
L577225	u3142	m206	GOODSPEED	I'm a field agent.
L577224	u3143	m206	MASON	What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
L604377	u3233	m214	KALEN	But there's nothing here.
L604376	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  Just about here.
L604375	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Around here.
L604374	u3233	m214	KALEN	This is it?
L604373	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... Well, you wanted to see it.
L604240	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
L604239	u3233	m214	KALEN	But you're only a mud carrier.
L604238	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
L604237	u3233	m214	KALEN	No...
L604236	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I think we should go on by ourselves.
L604183	u3233	m214	KALEN	He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
L604182	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What happened?
L604181	u3233	m214	KALEN	I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
L604179	u3233	m214	KALEN	About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
L604178	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What kind of stories?
L604177	u3233	m214	KALEN	No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
L604174	u3233	m214	KALEN	I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
L604173	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
L604172	u3233	m214	KALEN	The Hall of Books.
L604171	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Where?
L604170	u3233	m214	KALEN	There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
L604169	u3233	m214	KALEN	We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
L604168	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
L604167	u3233	m214	KALEN	What else can they do?
L604166	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
L604165	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm so sorry, Kalen.
L604164	u3233	m214	KALEN	She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
L603999	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
L603998	u3233	m214	KALEN	And everyone looks like us?
L603997	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
L603995	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
L603994	u3233	m214	KALEN	Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
L603993	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Ah... no.
L603990	u3233	m214	KALEN	I'm training to be a high climber.
L603989	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	On the towers?
L603988	u3233	m214	KALEN	What do you do on the towers?
L603986	u3233	m214	KALEN	I figured that.  What kind of accident?
L603985	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I had an accident.
L603984	u3233	m214	KALEN	Now how did you get hurt?
L603963	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	The journey is part of my work.
L603962	u3233	m214	KALEN	It must have been hard, leaving your work.
L604370	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I will...
L604369	u3241	m214	VOX	I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
L604368	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'll never forget this.
L604367	u3241	m214	VOX	Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
L604365	u3241	m214	VOX	I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
L604364	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't understand.
L604363	u3241	m214	VOX	Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
L604362	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I won't leave you like this.
L604361	u3241	m214	VOX	I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
L604360	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Vox...
L604359	u3241	m214	VOX	Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
L604358	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
L604357	u3241	m214	VOX	Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
L604356	u3241	m214	VOX	Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
L604355	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Vox --
L604279	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This has to end.
L604278	u3241	m214	VOX	End...?
L604277	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This has to end.
L604276	u3241	m214	VOX	How are your dreams now?
L604275	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L604274	u3241	m214	VOX	They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
L604271	u3241	m214	VOX	Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
L604270	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What do you mean?
L604269	u3241	m214	VOX	Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
L604268	u3241	m214	VOX	The Morlocks didn't build this.
L604267	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why did they built it?
L604266	u3241	m214	VOX	The air... the power.
L604265	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's it all for?
L604264	u3241	m214	VOX	This way.
L604263	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Vox?
L604262	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you know which way?
L604261	u3241	m214	VOX	Yes.
L604260	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Machines?
L604259	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... Thank you.
L604258	u3241	m214	VOX	In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
L604257	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
L604256	u3241	m214	VOX	Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
L604255	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This is the way in?
L604254	u3241	m214	VOX	It's what they want you to see.
L604250	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, shut up.
L604249	u3241	m214	VOX	Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
L604248	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604247	u3241	m214	VOX	So, do we go on?
L604246	u3241	m214	VOX	It was meant to.
L604245	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes...
L604244	u3241	m214	VOX	It frightens you.
L604243	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My God... I saw this.
L604235	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Kalen... hold on a minute.
L604234	u3241	m214	VOX	Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
L604233	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?
L604232	u3241	m214	VOX	Send him away.
L604231	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Last night.
L604230	u3241	m214	VOX	When was his mother taken?
L604228	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm used to that.
L604227	u3241	m214	VOX	And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
L604226	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604225	u3241	m214	VOX	So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
L604224	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
L604223	u3241	m214	VOX	Excuse me?
L604222	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because you'll never die.
L604218	u3241	m214	VOX	Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
L604217	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	We need your help.
L604214	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Can you show us where they live?
L604213	u3241	m214	VOX	Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
L604212	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How have you survived so long?
L604211	u3241	m214	VOX	I was lucky.  The others weren't.
L604210	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	But you escaped.
L604209	u3241	m214	VOX	Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
L604208	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you know where they live?
L604207	u3241	m214	VOX	Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
L604206	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know of them?
L604205	u3241	m214	VOX	Morlocks --
L604204	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
L604201	u3241	m214	VOX	I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
L604200	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir... have you a name?
L604199	u3241	m214	VOX	"An ""automaton""?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And ""these fragments I have shored against my ruins.""  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here..."
L604198	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
L604197	u3241	m214	VOX	I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
L604196	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What are you?
L604195	u3241	m214	VOX	I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
L604194	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	1899.
L604193	u3241	m214	VOX	I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
L604192	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How did you know?!
L604191	u3241	m214	VOX	Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
L604351	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because...
L604350	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	And why not?
L604349	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't think that's going to happen.
L604348	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
L604347	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Oh, you won't be running for long...
L604346	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm tired of running.
L604345	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
L604344	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know.
L604343	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
L604342	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm a foolish man.
L604341	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	That was a foolish thing to do.
L604334	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
L604333	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L604332	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
L604329	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L604328	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Now will you go?
L604327	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
L604326	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	A man can change his history.
L604325	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
L604324	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
L604323	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You took her because she helped me.
L604322	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
L604321	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	So you take their best...
L604320	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
L604319	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why?
L604314	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
L604313	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
L604312	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Say I just come back again?
L604311	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
L604310	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why would you let me go back?
L604309	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
L604308	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?
L604305	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It can't all be like this...
L604304	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
L604303	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
L604302	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	"I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more ""human"" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now."
L604301	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
L604300	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	They survived above.  Became what they are.
L604299	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	And what of the Eloi?
L604298	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
L604297	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How?
L604296	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	We make them see what we wish.
L604295	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How do you control the Morlocks?
L604294	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
L604293	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
L604292	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	As slaves.
L604291	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
L604290	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Created?
L604289	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	No, we created the Morlocks.
L604288	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
L604287	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
L604286	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Alexander.
L604285	u3238	m214	OVERLORD	What's your name?
L603762	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
L603761	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
L603760	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
L603759	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
L603758	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I just love mechanical things.
L603757	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
L603756	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
L603755	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How do you keep the water temperature stable?
L603754	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
L603753	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
L603752	u3236	m214	MOTORIST	Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
L603751	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It's spectacular...
L603939	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
L603938	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why is it -- breaking up?
L603937	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
L603936	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
L603935	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
L603934	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's happening to the moon?!
L603933	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
L603932	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I -- what are you?!
L603931	u3242	m214	VOX KIOSK	May I help you?
L603918	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I have something for you...
L603917	u3232	m214	EMMA	Let them.
L603916	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Let them.
L603915	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex... people are staring.
L603912	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It's only a machine.
L603911	u3232	m214	EMMA	Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
L603910	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I've seen it.
L603909	u3232	m214	EMMA	Heavens, look at that now!
L603908	u3232	m214	EMMA	So it's astronomy now, is it?
L603907	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
L603906	u3232	m214	EMMA	They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
L603905	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
L603904	u3232	m214	EMMA	We took a walk three days ago.
L603903	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
L603902	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
L603899	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex, it's just the zoo.
L603898	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My God...
L603896	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
L603895	u3232	m214	EMMA	Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
L603894	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
L603893	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex...?!
L603892	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
L603891	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex, what is it?
L603890	u3232	m214	EMMA	All right...
L603889	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No... let's walk through the city.
L603888	u3232	m214	EMMA	Let's walk through the park...
L603887	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not here... alone.  Please.
L603886	u3232	m214	EMMA	All right...
L603885	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I need... to talk to you.
L603884	u3232	m214	EMMA	Darling.
L603883	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Holding you... again.
L603882	u3232	m214	EMMA	Alex, what is it?
L603881	u3232	m214	EMMA	Trust me...
L603880	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know I can't.
L603879	u3232	m214	EMMA	Dance with me...
L603878	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Got here as soon as I could.
L603877	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're late.
L603793	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Your birth stone.  I thought --
L603792	u3232	m214	EMMA	A moonstone.
L603791	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know it's not a diamond but --
L603790	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Hold on... I know I have it...
L603789	u3232	m214	EMMA	You know, the moment is rather dying here.
L603785	u3232	m214	EMMA	And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
L603784	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
L603783	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're getting warmer.
L603782	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I mean... well... affection.
L603781	u3232	m214	EMMA	Admiration?  My my.
L603780	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
L603779	u3232	m214	EMMA	All right, what is it now?
L603778	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
L603777	u3232	m214	EMMA	... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
L603775	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
L603774	u3232	m214	EMMA	Talk away, Professor.
L603773	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I need to... um... talk to you.
L603772	u3232	m214	EMMA	Well there's something new.
L603771	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sorry... I was distracted.
L603770	u3232	m214	EMMA	You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
L603769	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What?
L603768	u3232	m214	EMMA	You promised me flowers.
L603767	u3232	m214	EMMA	Trust me...
L603766	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know I can't.
L603765	u3232	m214	EMMA	Dance with me...
L603764	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Got here as soon as I could.
L603763	u3232	m214	EMMA	You're late.
L604388	u3239	m214	PHILBY	His home.
L604387	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This... was my home.
L604384	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I'm glad.
L604383	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
L603874	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Good night, Alex.
L603873	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Good night, David.
L603872	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
L603871	u3239	m214	PHILBY	All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
L603870	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
L603869	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You won't say that in a week.
L603868	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
L603867	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's absurd --
L603866	u3239	m214	PHILBY	There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
L603865	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I can't leave when I'm so close.
L603864	u3239	m214	PHILBY	When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
L603863	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I can't do that --
L603862	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Why don't you come to our house instead?
L603861	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
L603860	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I would.
L603859	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You wouldn't believe me.
L603858	u3239	m214	PHILBY	What is it?
L603857	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
L603856	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
L603855	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
L603854	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Do you find her?
L603853	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
L603852	u3239	m214	PHILBY	It wasn't your fault, Alex.
L603851	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
L603850	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I know that --
L603849	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I live with it every minute of every day.
L603848	u3239	m214	PHILBY	What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
L603846	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I care more about my life.  And yours.
L603845	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
L603844	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
L603843	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Hiding?
L603842	u3239	m214	PHILBY	But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
L603841	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
L603840	u3239	m214	PHILBY	There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
L603839	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	For God's Sake, David --
L603838	u3239	m214	PHILBY	It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
L603837	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Then why are you here?
L603836	u3239	m214	PHILBY	It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
L603835	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm sorry, David.
L603834	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
L603833	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I've been working.
L603739	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Perseverance.
L603738	u3239	m214	PHILBY	All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
L603735	u3239	m214	PHILBY	She's gotten into your equations.
L603734	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh?
L603733	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
L603732	u3239	m214	PHILBY	No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
L603731	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
L603730	u3239	m214	PHILBY	She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
L603729	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
L603728	u3239	m214	PHILBY	The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
L603727	u3239	m214	PHILBY	How romantic...
L603726	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
L603715	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Nothing.
L603714	u3239	m214	PHILBY	What?
L603713	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	In the future, we'll be better.
L603711	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
L603710	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
L603709	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
L603708	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
L603707	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
L603706	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You sound like my father...
L603705	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
L603704	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Where's the challenge in that?
L603703	u3239	m214	PHILBY	You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
L603702	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
L603662	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	God, and I'm running late --
L603661	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Tonight's the night?
L603660	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
L603659	u3239	m214	PHILBY	"Somewhere around ""D+2xy something something."""
L603658	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I was not.
L603657	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Do you know you were humming?
L603656	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
L603805	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	All right, all right -- here -- everything --
L603804	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	Did you hear me, lad?
L603802	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I don't understand.
L603801	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
L603800	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir...?
L603799	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
L603798	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Thank you...
L603797	u3240	m214	THIN MAN	Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
L604379	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
L604378	u3235	m214	MARA	It was different then.
L604138	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
L604137	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara -- what -- ?!
L604134	u3235	m214	MARA	No!
L604133	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara...?
L604132	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen...
L604131	u3235	m214	MARA	Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
L604130	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara --
L604129	u3235	m214	MARA	Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
L604128	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I could...
L604127	u3235	m214	MARA	Go back to your own time?
L604126	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... I suppose so.
L604125	u3235	m214	MARA	So you can use it now?
L604124	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
L604123	u3235	m214	MARA	It's undamaged?
L604122	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
L604119	u3235	m214	MARA	I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
L604118	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
L604117	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	If you only knew...
L604116	u3235	m214	MARA	Is it?
L604115	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
L604114	u3235	m214	MARA	Someone you loved very much.
L604113	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604112	u3235	m214	MARA	You lost someone.
L604111	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This is where my journey started... right here.
L604109	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
L604108	u3235	m214	MARA	You know this?
L604107	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
L604106	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Orion's belt...
L604105	u3235	m214	MARA	Alexander...?
L604104	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
L604103	u3235	m214	MARA	It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
L604102	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
L604101	u3235	m214	MARA	It must have been safe.
L604100	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
L604099	u3235	m214	MARA	Did you have fires at night?
L604098	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
L604097	u3235	m214	MARA	Learning was important?
L604096	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
L604095	u3235	m214	MARA	You liked it there.
L604094	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
L604092	u3235	m214	MARA	I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
L604091	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	How do you decide?
L604090	u3235	m214	MARA	I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
L604089	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What are you?
L604088	u3235	m214	MARA	And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
L604087	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Or mud carriers.
L604086	u3235	m214	MARA	It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
L604085	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
L604084	u3235	m214	MARA	It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
L604083	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
L604082	u3235	m214	MARA	I don't understand.
L604081	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's it all for?
L604080	u3235	m214	MARA	It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
L604079	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
L604078	u3235	m214	MARA	Want to be a high climber now, do you?
L604077	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I can see Kalen's point.
L604076	u3235	m214	MARA	The mud carriers.
L604075	u3235	m214	MARA	Yes.
L604074	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	"And this is your ""work""?"
L604073	u3235	m214	MARA	Thank you.
L604072	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	This is magnificent...
L604070	u3235	m214	MARA	We share everything.
L604069	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You share dreams?  That's incredible.
L604068	u3235	m214	MARA	Every night.
L604067	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	All of you?
L604066	u3235	m214	MARA	We all have that dream.
L604065	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes!
L604064	u3235	m214	MARA	And you saw a shape ahead of you...
L604063	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.
L604062	u3235	m214	MARA	Then you came to a desert and mountains...
L604061	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
L604052	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Good night.
L604051	u3235	m214	MARA	Good night, then.
L604050	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
L604049	u3235	m214	MARA	Don't then have stars where you come from?
L604048	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You can see so many here.
L604047	u3235	m214	MARA	You seem fascinated by the stars.
L604046	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Thank you...
L604045	u3235	m214	MARA	I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
L604044	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I will...
L604043	u3235	m214	MARA	I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
L604042	u3235	m214	MARA	Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
L604041	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Is he all right?
L604033	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
L604032	u3235	m214	MARA	I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
L604031	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
L604030	u3235	m214	MARA	I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
L604029	u3235	m214	MARA	Why would you do that?
L604028	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Why not?
L604027	u3235	m214	MARA	Why?
L604026	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	More than 800,000 years.
L604025	u3235	m214	MARA	How long ago?
L604024	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
L604023	u3235	m214	MARA	That machine --
L604022	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
L604021	u3235	m214	MARA	Oh, that explains everything.
L604019	u3235	m214	MARA	Then you can speak slowly.
L604018	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
L604017	u3235	m214	MARA	We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
L604016	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What makes you say that?
L604015	u3235	m214	MARA	You're not from beyond the valley.
L604014	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
L604013	u3235	m214	MARA	He's gone to a better place.
L604012	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Your husband is dead?
L604011	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
L604007	u3235	m214	MARA	Mm.
L604006	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	His curiosity is amazing.
L604001	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
L604000	u3235	m214	MARA	Is there a lot of illness?
L603982	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Thank you.
L603981	u3235	m214	MARA	Yes.
L603961	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
L603960	u3235	m214	MARA	How long did you travel?
L603946	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes...
L603945	u3235	m214	MARA	You're up!  You must be feeling better --
L603831	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	That'll be all.
L603830	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	May I get you some --
L603829	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
L603827	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Tell him to go away --
L603826	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Yes, sir, he --
L603825	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Here?
L603824	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
L603743	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
L603742	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Oh, I'm already swooning.
L603741	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
L603740	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
L603724	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
L603723	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
L603722	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Don't torture me -- do you have it?
L603719	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Hello, Mr. Philby.
L603718	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Do you have it?!
L603717	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Oh huzzah, the master's home.
L603696	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
L603695	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes, sir.
L603692	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
L603691	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	"Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical ""durations"" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?"
L603690	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My equations are not parlor-tricks!
L603689	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
L603688	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
L603686	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir --
L603685	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
L603684	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No, sir --
L603683	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	"No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't ""inspiring"" to you.  Perhaps they don't ""challenge"" you --"
L603682	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	And roosters.
L603679	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Do they?
L603678	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
L603677	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
L603676	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Might I ask why?
L603675	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	"Well... perhaps I have ""deviated"" the tiniest bit."
L603674	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
L603673	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Imagine that.
L603672	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
L603671	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Exactly correct, sir.
L603670	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	"As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is ""Applied Mathematics and Engineering"", am I correct?"
L603669	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I see.
L603668	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
L604158	u3234	m214	KORUS	We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
L604157	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You won't even try?
L604156	u3234	m214	KORUS	We are what we are.
L604155	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Then it's time to change that --
L604154	u3234	m214	KORUS	This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
L604151	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
L604150	u3234	m214	KORUS	We choose to believe it.
L604149	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	You know that's not true.
L604148	u3234	m214	KORUS	They've gone to a better place.
L604147	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	What do you mean?!
L604146	u3234	m214	KORUS	Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
L604145	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	We have to go after them, find where -- !
L604144	u3234	m214	KORUS	We don't know.
L604143	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Where do they take them?!
L604056	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I suppose so.
L604055	u3234	m214	KORUS	Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
L603980	u3234	m214	KORUS	Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
L603979	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
L603978	u3234	m214	KORUS	My father has gone to a better place.
L603977	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
L603976	u3234	m214	KORUS	I am the oldest.
L603975	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
L603974	u3234	m214	KORUS	New Yorkers.
L603973	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
L603972	u3234	m214	KORUS	Why?
L603971	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
L603968	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I took a different route.
L603967	u3234	m214	KORUS	He said he traveled for two months.
L603966	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	No...
L603965	u3234	m214	KORUS	We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
L603959	u3234	m214	KORUS	New Yorkers.
L603958	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
L603957	u3234	m214	KORUS	What are your people called?
L603956	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	Eloi?
L603949	u3234	m214	KORUS	Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
L603948	u3230	m214	ALEXANDER	I did...
L603947	u3234	m214	KORUS	And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
L603700	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
L603699	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Yes, sir.
L603698	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
L603697	u3239	m214	PHILBY	If I might explain, sir --
L603694	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
L603693	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Sir, if I may --
L603667	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Dean Fulton...
L603666	u3231	m214	DEAN FULTON	My fowl have polluted the yard.
L604038	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
L604037	u3233	m214	KALEN	They're inside --
L604036	u3235	m214	MARA	No, you're safe --
L604035	u3233	m214	KALEN	They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
L604034	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
L604004	u3233	m214	KALEN	You'll tell me more tomorrow?
L604003	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
L604002	u3233	m214	KALEN	I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
L603992	u3233	m214	KALEN	I am.  Are you a climber?
L603991	u3235	m214	MARA	We'll see about that.
L603970	u3235	m214	MARA	What's it like where you come from?
L603969	u3233	m214	KALEN	What did you do at night?
L603954	u3235	m214	MARA	That's quite enough, Kalen.
L603953	u3233	m214	KALEN	I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
L603952	u3235	m214	MARA	Kalen...
L603951	u3233	m214	KALEN	How did you get hurt?
L604393	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
L604392	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
L604391	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
L604386	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
L604385	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Sir?
L604382	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	No, sir.
L604381	u3239	m214	PHILBY	And you've no idea where he went?
L604380	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
L603747	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	For our sake, I hope not.
L603746	u3239	m214	PHILBY	I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
L603721	u3237	m214	MRS. WATCHIT	Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
L603720	u3239	m214	PHILBY	Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
L620989	u3327	m221	BENNY	Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!

L620710	u3327	m221	BENNY	First time on Mars?

L620705	u3341	m221	QUAID	What to the rebels want?
L620702	u3341	m221	QUAID	What was that?  An accident?

L620695	u3341	m221	QUAID	What's wrong with this one?
L620987	u3327	m221	BENNY	Hey, I got four kids to feed.
L620986	u3340	m221	MELINA	How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
L620913	u3327	m221	BENNY	I think my grampa might be here.
L620912	u3340	m221	MELINA	But maybe you can change all that.
L620911	u3327	m221	BENNY	And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
L620887	u3327	m221	BENNY	Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
L620886	u3340	m221	MELINA	Shut up and drive!

L620563	u3341	m221	QUAID	How'd you find me?

L620690	u3329	m221	CLERK	I'll go encode your room key.
L620689	u3329	m221	CLERK	Identification?
L620688	u3341	m221	QUAID	Get it, please.
L620687	u3329	m221	CLERK	Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
L620686	u3341	m221	QUAID	Definitely.
L620685	u3329	m221	CLERK	Would you like the same suite?
L620684	u3341	m221	QUAID	Thank you.
L620683	u3329	m221	CLERK	Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
L621095	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
L621094	u3341	m221	QUAID	I am Quaid.
L621093	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
L621091	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
L621090	u3341	m221	QUAID	Do you expect me to believe you?
L621089	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
L621088	u3341	m221	QUAID	What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
L621035	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
L621034	u3341	m221	QUAID	Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
L621023	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
L621022	u3341	m221	QUAID	The guy's a fucking asshole.
L621015	u3341	m221	QUAID	Who is it this time--my mother?
L621014	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
L621013	u3341	m221	QUAID	Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
L621012	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
L621011	u3341	m221	QUAID	Sorry.  Too perfect.
L621010	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
L621008	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
L621007	u3341	m221	QUAID	So why am I still alive?
L621006	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
L621005	u3341	m221	QUAID	Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
L621004	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
L621003	u3341	m221	QUAID	He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
L621002	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
L620998	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
L620997	u3341	m221	QUAID	Fuck you.
L620996	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Well, my boy, you're a hero.
L621051	u3342	m221	RICHTER	It's about goddamn time.
L621050	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Kill him.
L620964	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Don't be an idiot.
L620963	u3342	m221	RICHTER	I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
L620906	u3342	m221	RICHTER	Yes, sir.
L620905	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
L620904	u3342	m221	RICHTER	They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
L620903	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Stop fighting and get out.
L620678	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
L620677	u3342	m221	RICHTER	Yes, sir.
L620676	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
L620675	u3342	m221	RICHTER	Yes, sir.
L620674	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
L620673	u3342	m221	RICHTER	But I thought...
L620672	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	I know that.
L620671	u3342	m221	RICHTER	He had help.  From our side, sir.
L620669	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
L620668	u3342	m221	RICHTER	No, sir.
L620667	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
L620546	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
L620545	u3342	m221	RICHTER	That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
L620544	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
L620543	u3342	m221	RICHTER	We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
L620542	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
L620541	u3342	m221	RICHTER	I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
L620540	u3330	m221	COHAAGEN	What the fuck is going on down there?!
L620439	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Come on...put his head in place.
L620438	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
L620437	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
L620436	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
L620432	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
L620431	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	Oh shit....Oh shit...
L620430	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	We haven't implanted it yet.
L620429	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	Why not?
L620428	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	I'm afraid that's not possible.
L620427	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
L620426	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
L620418	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
L620417	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
L620411	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Looks like another schizoid embolism.
L620410	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	I'm with an very important client.
L620409	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	You better get down here.
L620408	u3339	m221	MCCLANE	What is it?
L620407	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Bob?
L620402	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Forty-one A, Ernie.
L620401	u3341	m221	QUAID	Sleazy...and demure.
L620400	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
L620398	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
L620397	u3341	m221	QUAID	Brunette.
L620396	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Blonde, brunette, redhead?
L620395	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
L620394	u3341	m221	QUAID	Hetero.
L620393	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Your sexual orientation?
L620388	u3341	m221	QUAID	Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
L620387	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
L620386	u3341	m221	QUAID	Eight years.
L620385	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	So, been married long?
L620382	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
L620381	u3341	m221	QUAID	Two-headed monsters?
L620379	u3341	m221	QUAID	Nice to meet you.
L620378	u3331	m221	DR. LULL	Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
L620848	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
L620847	u3341	m221	QUAID	What is it?
L620846	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	Swallow this.
L620845	u3341	m221	QUAID	Suppose I do...then what?
L620832	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
L620831	u3341	m221	QUAID	You open it.
L620829	u3341	m221	QUAID	That's right.
L620828	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	"Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? ""She's real because you dreamed her?"""
L620827	u3341	m221	QUAID	She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
L620826	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
L620825	u3341	m221	QUAID	Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
L620824	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
L620823	u3341	m221	QUAID	How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
L620822	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
L620821	u3341	m221	QUAID	Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
L620820	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
L620819	u3341	m221	QUAID	Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
L620818	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
L620817	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	At Rekall.
L620816	u3341	m221	QUAID	Amazing.  Where are we?
L620815	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
L620814	u3341	m221	QUAID	Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
L620813	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
L620812	u3341	m221	QUAID	I'm listening.
L620811	u3332	m221	EDGEMAR	This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
L620810	u3341	m221	QUAID	What do you want?
L620908	u3333	m221	EVERETT	O.K., everybody pull out!

L620951	u3334	m221	GEORGE	Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.

L651092	u3452	m228	ALICE	Looks like weather.
L650980	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
L650979	u3452	m228	ALICE	That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
L650977	u3452	m228	ALICE	Not yet.
L650976	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Did we lose anybody?
L651256	u3453	m228	ALL	Give me some time to Blow the man down!
L651255	u3465	m228	RICK	"She said ""None the better, you all go to hell..."""
L651254	u3453	m228	ALL	Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
L651253	u3465	m228	RICK	So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
L651249	u3453	m228	ALL	Give me some time to blow the man down...
L651248	u3465	m228	RICK	A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
L651247	u3453	m228	ALL	Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
L651246	u3465	m228	RICK	Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
L651645	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
L651644	u3454	m228	BILL	Yes sir.
L651643	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Carry on.
L651100	u3454	m228	BILL	Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
L651099	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
L651079	u3454	m228	BILL	We've got weather moving in from the west.
L651078	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Well, that's all part of it.
L651077	u3454	m228	BILL	Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
L651076	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Come in.
L651016	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
L651015	u3454	m228	BILL	I didn't know sir.
L651014	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
L650971	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
L650970	u3454	m228	BILL	Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
L650962	u3454	m228	BILL	Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
L650961	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
L650941	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Good.  Let's go sailing.
L650940	u3454	m228	BILL	Yes, Sir.
L650939	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Everyone aboard young Bill?
L651757	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Thank you.
L651756	u3454	m228	BILL	Fifteen.
L651755	u3467	m228	SANDERS	How old are you, son?
L651754	u3454	m228	BILL	My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
L651753	u3467	m228	SANDERS	But your instinct was to lose sail?
L651752	u3454	m228	BILL	Skipper called us out of the rigging.
L651751	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Why didn't you drop any sail?
L651799	u3470	m228	TOD	It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
L651798	u3454	m228	BILL	What do you mean?
L651797	u3470	m228	TOD	There's still a way.
L651718	u3454	m228	BILL	It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
L651717	u3470	m228	TOD	It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
L650909	u3454	m228	BILL	You came back, Tod.  You came back.
L650908	u3470	m228	TOD	Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
L650907	u3454	m228	BILL	Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
L651689	u3455	m228	CHARLES	No, I can't.
L651688	u3456	m228	CHUCK	When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
L651683	u3455	m228	CHARLES	All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
L651682	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Fine.
L651680	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Okay.
L651679	u3455	m228	CHARLES	Why don't you go and try some of that on?
L651677	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yeah, sure.
L651676	u3455	m228	CHARLES	I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
L651673	u3455	m228	CHARLES	I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
L651672	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Where's Mom?
L650799	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yes sir.
L650798	u3455	m228	CHARLES	Make us proud.
L650813	u3465	m228	RICK	Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
L650812	u3456	m228	CHUCK	"What the ""Bowsprit Affair""?"
L650805	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Whatever.
L650804	u3465	m228	RICK	Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
L650803	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Gieg, Chuck.
L650802	u3465	m228	RICK	Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
L650801	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yeah.
L650800	u3465	m228	RICK	Albatross?
L651611	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I feel like... we can do anything.
L651610	u3461	m228	JOHN	Me either.
L651609	u3456	m228	CHUCK	You know, I never had friends like this.
L651608	u3461	m228	JOHN	I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
L651607	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
L651606	u3461	m228	JOHN	Figured what out?
L651605	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
L651604	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Anonymous.
L651603	u3461	m228	JOHN	What was that?
L651602	u3456	m228	CHUCK	That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
L651601	u3461	m228	JOHN	What?
L651600	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Feels different doesn't it?
L651598	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
L651597	u3461	m228	JOHN	I couldn't have done it without you.
L651596	u3456	m228	CHUCK	This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
L651595	u3461	m228	JOHN	I just can't believe it.
L651594	u3456	m228	CHUCK	You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
L651593	u3461	m228	JOHN	I know.
L651592	u3456	m228	CHUCK	It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
L651591	u3456	m228	CHUCK	What about you?
L651590	u3461	m228	JOHN	Congratulations.
L651589	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Ninety-six.
L651588	u3461	m228	JOHN	Yeah.  How'd you do.
L651587	u3456	m228	CHUCK	You okay?
L651376	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
L651375	u3461	m228	JOHN	Believe what?
L651374	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
L651331	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
L651330	u3461	m228	JOHN	They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
L651325	u3461	m228	JOHN	Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
L651324	u3456	m228	CHUCK	You're not a moron.
L651323	u3461	m228	JOHN	I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
L651322	u3456	m228	CHUCK	What?
L651321	u3461	m228	JOHN	I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
L651314	u3461	m228	JOHN	You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
L651313	u3456	m228	CHUCK	If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
L651312	u3461	m228	JOHN	Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
L651310	u3461	m228	JOHN	To take a piss.
L651309	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Where you going?
L651195	u3461	m228	JOHN	My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
L651194	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yeah.
L651182	u3456	m228	CHUCK	So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
L651181	u3461	m228	JOHN	That's what they get for not locking the door.
L651180	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
L651171	u3461	m228	JOHN	I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
L651170	u3456	m228	CHUCK	What do you mean?
L651169	u3461	m228	JOHN	She isn't that old.
L650778	u3472	m228	WILL	You don't give him enough credit Chas.
L650777	u3456	m228	CHUCK	He does.
L650776	u3472	m228	WILL	Nobody says you have to be like me.
L650775	u3456	m228	CHUCK	"I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be ""William""."
L650774	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Because it looks good.
L650773	u3472	m228	WILL	Why then.
L650772	u3456	m228	CHUCK	That's not why he's sending me.
L650771	u3472	m228	WILL	I thought this was your dream come true.
L650770	u3456	m228	CHUCK	It's not a vacation, it's private school.
L650769	u3472	m228	WILL	It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
L650768	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
L650767	u3472	m228	WILL	You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
L651744	u3464	m228	PHIL	I know enough.
L651743	u3456	m228	CHUCK	You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
L651742	u3464	m228	PHIL	I gotta go.
L651741	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Is it true Phil?
L651740	u3464	m228	PHIL	Well that's just typical isn't it?
L651739	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
L651736	u3464	m228	PHIL	I guess.
L651735	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Can we talk?
L651457	u3464	m228	PHIL	Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
L651456	u3456	m228	CHUCK	You only hurt yourself you know?
L651455	u3464	m228	PHIL	What's the difference?
L651454	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Why'd you do it?
L651352	u3464	m228	PHIL	Like this!
L651351	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
L651296	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Shut up, Phil.
L651295	u3464	m228	PHIL	God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
L651225	u3456	m228	CHUCK	It was a bad dream...
L651224	u3464	m228	PHIL	Hey, shut up will ya?
L651803	u3470	m228	TOD	That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
L651802	u3456	m228	CHUCK	But that's not the point...
L651801	u3470	m228	TOD	They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
L651800	u3456	m228	CHUCK	You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
L651524	u3470	m228	TOD	I'm pissin' fire man.
L651523	u3456	m228	CHUCK	We all have problems.
L651522	u3470	m228	TOD	Listen man, I think I have a problem.
L651213	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
L651212	u3470	m228	TOD	Sorry to here it.
L650797	u3463	m228	MIDDY	I know you will.
L650796	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
L650795	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Look, I just better go.
L650794	u3463	m228	MIDDY	Passport?
L650793	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yes.
L650792	u3463	m228	MIDDY	Do you have your ticket?
L650788	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Me too.
L650787	u3463	m228	MIDDY	It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
L650786	u3456	m228	CHUCK	No, I didn't.
L650785	u3463	m228	MIDDY	Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
L651474	u3456	m228	CHUCK	What are you talking about.
L651473	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I can't go in there.
L651337	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I can't make it out?
L651336	u3456	m228	CHUCK	What are they doing?
L651237	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I couldn't.
L651236	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Jesus, you never told them?
L651235	u3466	m228	ROBIN	My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
L651234	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Who?
L651233	u3466	m228	ROBIN	That's how he died you know.
L651231	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
L651230	u3466	m228	ROBIN	It works?
L651229	u3456	m228	CHUCK	My dad.
L651228	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Who told you that?
L651227	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
L651226	u3466	m228	ROBIN	It was so real...
L651211	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
L651210	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
L651209	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Where are you from any way?
L651191	u3466	m228	ROBIN	'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
L651190	u3456	m228	CHUCK	How do you know?  They might.
L651189	u3466	m228	ROBIN	My parents don't do it anymore.
L651186	u3456	m228	CHUCK	"I said ""Sorry, wrong room"" and walked away."
L651185	u3466	m228	ROBIN	What'd you do?
L651184	u3456	m228	CHUCK	"My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice ""What?"""
L651183	u3466	m228	ROBIN	So... What happened?
L651177	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Come on man, what'd they look like?
L651176	u3456	m228	CHUCK	No way!
L651168	u3456	m228	CHUCK	That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
L651167	u3466	m228	ROBIN	"Ya know... ""It""."
L651166	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Do what?
L651165	u3466	m228	ROBIN	You think Skipper and Alice do it?
L651067	u3456	m228	CHUCK	It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
L651066	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
L651065	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
L651064	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Forget it.
L651063	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I feel like I got you into this.
L651062	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I just brought you something to eat.
L651061	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
L651060	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Good.
L651059	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Fine.
L651058	u3456	m228	CHUCK	How ya doing?
L650879	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I can't watch this.
L650878	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Jesus.
L650860	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Maybe it's an air raid.
L650859	u3466	m228	ROBIN	What the hell is going on?
L651497	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
L651496	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I don't know.
L651495	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Does Phil know how you guys feel?
L651492	u3456	m228	CHUCK	They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
L651491	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	They have every right Chuck.
L651490	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
L651489	u3456	m228	CHUCK	It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
L651488	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Of a fight he can't win out here.
L651487	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Of what?
L651486	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	The Dolphin was a symptom.
L651485	u3456	m228	CHUCK	He killed the dolphin.
L651484	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Why do you think I'm sending him home?
L651483	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Close the door.  Sit down.
L651482	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Sir...?
L651481	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Can't do it.
L651480	u3456	m228	CHUCK	The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
L651479	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Well, spit it out.
L651478	u3456	m228	CHUCK	I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
L651477	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	What's on your mind?
L651088	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
L651087	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Shouldn't we turn away?
L651084	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
L651083	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
L651082	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Uh, huh.
L651045	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Face what?
L651044	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
L651009	u3456	m228	CHUCK	It was my fault.  I slipped.
L651008	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You all right?
L650973	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	All stop on the engine.
L650972	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yes, sir.
L650969	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Unfurl the squares!
L650968	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Northeast sir!
L650967	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Speak up boy!
L650966	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Ah... Northeast... sir.
L650945	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  I want to know that you've heard and understand.  Raise the mainsail.
L650944	u3456	m228	CHUCK	Yes sir.
L650943	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
L651558	u3457	m228	COMMANDER	That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
L651557	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
L651556	u3457	m228	COMMANDER	Stow away?
L651555	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Your cannons made a compelling argument.
L651554	u3457	m228	COMMANDER	But you invited is aboard.
L651553	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	So is violating international law.
L651552	u3457	m228	COMMANDER	Chicken is a fool's game captain.
L651813	u3470	m228	TOD	No.
L651812	u3458	m228	DOWNING	So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
L651811	u3470	m228	TOD	Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
L651810	u3458	m228	DOWNING	Then what do you think he was trying to do.
L651809	u3470	m228	TOD	No.
L651808	u3458	m228	DOWNING	Is that what you were trained to do?
L651807	u3470	m228	TOD	Twice.
L651806	u3458	m228	DOWNING	But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
L651805	u3470	m228	TOD	I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
L651804	u3458	m228	DOWNING	Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
L651367	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
L651366	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	What is it we can do for you today?
L651365	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
L651364	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	And, of course, we are.
L651363	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
L650936	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	He's a big boy.
L650935	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
L650934	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Take good care of my son.
L650933	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	It will be more than that, I can promise you.
L650932	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
L650931	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
L650930	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
L650929	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
L650928	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
L650927	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	As you can see, there's a lot to do.
L650926	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
L650923	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I know.
L650922	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
L650921	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
L650920	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
L651738	u3464	m228	PHIL	It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
L651737	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Who is it Philip?
L651399	u3464	m228	PHIL	No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
L651398	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
L651397	u3464	m228	PHIL	It has nothing to do with him.
L651396	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
L651394	u3464	m228	PHIL	Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
L651393	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Oh, really?
L651392	u3464	m228	PHIL	I can take care of myself.
L651391	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Spying?!
L651388	u3464	m228	PHIL	Why are you here?
L651387	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
L651386	u3464	m228	PHIL	I should be eating with the crew.
L651385	u3459	m228	FRANCIS	What's wrong, you don't like steak?
L651543	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
L651542	u3460	m228	GEORGE	They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
L651534	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	She's Cuban.
L651533	u3460	m228	GEORGE	Jesus.  She's got guns.
L651273	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	They'll know about it in the morning.
L651272	u3460	m228	GEORGE	What's that?
L651271	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
L651270	u3460	m228	GEORGE	And being sixteen.
L651269	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
L651268	u3460	m228	GEORGE	Immortality.
L651252	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	A padlock.
L651251	u3460	m228	GEORGE	What's that?
L651250	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
L651245	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
L651244	u3460	m228	GEORGE	Son-of-a-bitch.
L651243	u3460	m228	GEORGE	I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
L651242	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You're officer of the watch, George.
L651241	u3460	m228	GEORGE	What?!  What's happening?!!
L651053	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
L651052	u3460	m228	GEORGE	Yes sir.
L651051	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
L651050	u3460	m228	GEORGE	Yes.  I do.
L651049	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You do?
L651048	u3460	m228	GEORGE	I think you were too hard on Weathers.
L651432	u3464	m228	PHIL	Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
L651431	u3461	m228	JOHN	Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
L651334	u3461	m228	JOHN	Why would you do that?
L651333	u3464	m228	PHIL	Me, too.
L651327	u3464	m228	PHIL	I can show you how to use a slide rule.
L651326	u3461	m228	JOHN	Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
L651293	u3464	m228	PHIL	Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
L651292	u3461	m228	JOHN	We'll think of something.
L651291	u3464	m228	PHIL	How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
L651290	u3461	m228	JOHN	That's enough.
L651289	u3464	m228	PHIL	Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
L651281	u3461	m228	JOHN	Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
L651280	u3464	m228	PHIL	Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
L651318	u3461	m228	JOHN	I don't have to listen to this.
L651317	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Why, man?
L651197	u3461	m228	JOHN	Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
L651196	u3466	m228	ROBIN	It matters to me.
L651193	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I figured it out.
L651192	u3461	m228	JOHN	They tell you that?
L651179	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
L651178	u3461	m228	JOHN	Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
L651175	u3461	m228	JOHN	On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
L651174	u3466	m228	ROBIN	What?  Come on...
L651173	u3461	m228	JOHN	Trust me donut.  I know.
L651172	u3466	m228	ROBIN	How would you know?
L651122	u3461	m228	JOHN	Like you'd know what to do with one.
L651121	u3466	m228	ROBIN	"If you've got ""a broad"" available I'll take her."
L650996	u3461	m228	JOHN	Shut up donut.
L650995	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
L650905	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Come on, he didn't mean anything.
L650904	u3461	m228	JOHN	Don't ever call me stupid.
L650899	u3461	m228	JOHN	Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
L650898	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I couldn't do it.
L650897	u3461	m228	JOHN	Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
L650896	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Why'd you jump?
L650895	u3461	m228	JOHN	What's your problem?
L651438	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
L651437	u3461	m228	JOHN	Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
L651436	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
L651005	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
L651004	u3461	m228	JOHN	What?
L651003	u3461	m228	JOHN	What is it... the secret?
L651002	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
L650998	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	You know what he is talking about here?
L650997	u3461	m228	JOHN	Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
L650992	u3461	m228	JOHN	Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
L650991	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	That's not a satisfactory answer.
L650870	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
L650869	u3461	m228	JOHN	I don't.
L651560	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
L651559	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
L651551	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
L651550	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
L651549	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	What's that?
L651548	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	We've got a problem.
L651086	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
L651085	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	What do you think?
L650958	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Outer.
L650957	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	Tie it off!!
L650954	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	It seems we're short on singers.
L650953	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
L650938	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
L650937	u3462	m228	LAWFORD	Well, that was neighborly.
L651461	u3464	m228	PHIL	About anything.
L651460	u3465	m228	RICK	About yourself?
L651459	u3464	m228	PHIL	It hurts too much to care.
L651458	u3465	m228	RICK	You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
L651442	u3465	m228	RICK	No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
L651441	u3464	m228	PHIL	Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
L651340	u3465	m228	RICK	What?
L651339	u3464	m228	PHIL	They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
L651141	u3465	m228	RICK	No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
L651140	u3464	m228	PHIL	You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
L651434	u3464	m228	PHIL	Son of a bitch!!
L651433	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
L651428	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
L651427	u3464	m228	PHIL	It's outta here!
L651426	u3464	m228	PHIL	Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
L651425	u3466	m228	ROBIN	No way Phil.  Not like this.
L651424	u3464	m228	PHIL	Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
L651423	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Phil.  What are you doing?
L651350	u3464	m228	PHIL	There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
L651349	u3466	m228	ROBIN	But, they don't speak English.
L651348	u3464	m228	PHIL	You've gotta be kidding?
L651347	u3466	m228	ROBIN	What are we supposed to talk about?
L651329	u3464	m228	PHIL	Long enough.
L651328	u3466	m228	ROBIN	How long you been standing there?
L651449	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
L651448	u3464	m228	PHIL	I'm not gonna kill it.
L651220	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
L651219	u3464	m228	PHIL	Joy, rapture...
L651218	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
L651095	u3464	m228	PHIL	I'm not staying out here.
L651094	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
L651043	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
L651042	u3464	m228	PHIL	No, sir.
L651022	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Then keep your mouth shut.
L651021	u3464	m228	PHIL	No.
L651020	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Do you have something to say?
L650984	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
L650983	u3464	m228	PHIL	Suicidal...
L650925	u3464	m228	PHIL	Sir.
L650924	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
L651036	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
L651035	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
L651034	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Are you hating this?!  Are you!
L651033	u3466	m228	ROBIN	Aaauuuhhh!!!
L651032	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
L651031	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I can't.
L651030	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
L651028	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I don't know...
L651027	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	What are you blubbering about?
L651025	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Sorry won't cut it.
L651024	u3466	m228	ROBIN	I'm sorry...
L651023	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	What's it going to be?
L651019	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Up you go.  Right now.
L651018	u3466	m228	ROBIN	What?
L651017	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Swing up, son.
L651792	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
L651791	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Yes.
L651788	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
L651787	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
L651786	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Yes, that's true.
L651785	u3467	m228	SANDERS	... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
L651784	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	For killing a dolphin.
L651783	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
L651782	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	They are much more than that, sir.
L651781	u3467	m228	SANDERS	"Except, a ""White Squall"".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys..."
L651780	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
L651779	u3467	m228	SANDERS	You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
L651778	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I can't be sure.
L651777	u3467	m228	SANDERS	What makes you so sure it was one?
L651776	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	No.
L651771	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	Yes, I was.
L651770	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
L651767	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
L651766	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	He climbed when he was ready.
L651765	u3467	m228	SANDERS	Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
L651821	u3471	m228	TYLER	Then what are you trying to say then?
L651820	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
L651819	u3471	m228	TYLER	If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
L651773	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	No.  I didn't.
L651772	u3471	m228	TYLER	And you didn't do anything about it?
L651701	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I am accountable.
L651700	u3471	m228	TYLER	The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
L651699	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	... Absolutely not.
L651698	u3471	m228	TYLER	The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
L651696	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
L651695	u3471	m228	TYLER	I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
L651694	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	It wasn't hard.
L651693	u3471	m228	TYLER	How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
L651692	u3471	m228	TYLER	May I ask you something?
L651691	u3468	m228	SKIPPER	I understand.
L651690	u3471	m228	TYLER	There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
L651714	u3469	m228	TERRY	That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
L651713	u3470	m228	TOD	I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
L651712	u3469	m228	TERRY	Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
L651711	u3470	m228	TOD	What's that supposed to mean?!
L651710	u3469	m228	TERRY	Easy for you to say.
L651379	u3469	m228	TERRY	Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
L651378	u3470	m228	TOD	Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
L651377	u3469	m228	TERRY	"Soon as we ship it'll be ""forgetta""."
L10344	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	No way that could just be seawater.
L10343	u3520	m232	BUD	You done impressing yourself, ace?
L10257	u3520	m232	BUD	Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
L10256	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
L10255	u3520	m232	BUD	It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
L10254	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Okay, good reason.  Then what?
L10253	u3520	m232	BUD	We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
L10252	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
L10251	u3520	m232	BUD	There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
L10250	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
L10242	u3520	m232	BUD	Where're you?
L10241	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
L10212	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	Piece of cake, baby.
L10211	u3520	m232	BUD	This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
L10191	u3527	m232	ONE NIGHT	I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
L10190	u3520	m232	BUD	Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
L10267	u3528	m232	SONNY	What is that?  You drop your dive light?
L10266	u3520	m232	BUD	Nice shot, Lins.
L10227	u3520	m232	BUD	Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
L10226	u3528	m232	SONNY	Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
L10145	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
L10144	u3528	m232	SONNY	You got it?!  You got it?
L10121	u3528	m232	SONNY	I'm alright, I'm dealing.
L10120	u3520	m232	BUD	How you guys doing?
L9939	u3520	m232	BUD	We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
L9938	u3528	m232	SONNY	She-hit.
L10380	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
L10379	u3520	m232	BUD	Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
L10135	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Yeah, okay.  Okay.
L10134	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
L10133	u3524	m232	JAMMER	No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
L10132	u3520	m232	BUD	I'm taking you back out.
L10131	u3524	m232	JAMMER	I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
L10130	u3520	m232	BUD	Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
L10129	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, you okay?
L10128	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Lord Almighty.
L10127	u3520	m232	BUD	Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
L10126	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Where are we?
L10081	u3524	m232	JAMMER	How deep's the drop-off here?
L10080	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay so far.
L9937	u3520	m232	BUD	Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
L9936	u3524	m232	JAMMER	What's goin' on, Boss?
L9920	u3520	m232	BUD	Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
L9919	u3524	m232	JAMMER	Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
L10587	u3520	m232	BUD	Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
L10586	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Hello, Brigman.
L10492	u3520	m232	BUD	Who then?
L10491	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No, Bud, no... not you.
L10489	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
L10488	u3520	m232	BUD	'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
L10487	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
L10486	u3520	m232	BUD	Hi, lady.
L10485	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
L10458	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Tell me later.
L10457	u3520	m232	BUD	Oh God, Lins... I--
L10455	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
L10454	u3520	m232	BUD	It is insane.
L10452	u3520	m232	BUD	WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
L10451	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
L10450	u3520	m232	BUD	What's the plan?
L10449	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
L10448	u3520	m232	BUD	FUCK LOGIC!!
L10447	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
L10446	u3520	m232	BUD	Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
L10445	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
L10444	u3520	m232	BUD	Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
L10443	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
L10442	u3520	m232	BUD	Alright, put this on.
L10441	u3520	m232	BUD	Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
L10440	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
L10439	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
L10438	u3520	m232	BUD	I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
L10437	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We've only got one suit.
L10436	u3520	m232	BUD	I don't know how!
L10435	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	How?
L10434	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
L10433	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Calm down, Bud.
L10432	u3520	m232	BUD	Son of a bitch!
L10430	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I don't know, look around.
L10429	u3520	m232	BUD	Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
L10428	u3520	m232	BUD	Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
L10427	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You see where it's coming in?
L10426	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
L10425	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	They'll come out after us.
L10424	u3520	m232	BUD	Good hundred yards, I'd say.
L10422	u3520	m232	BUD	Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
L10421	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Well, that's that.
L10420	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
L10419	u3520	m232	BUD	Try again.
L10417	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You noticed.
L10416	u3520	m232	BUD	It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
L10415	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Yeah.  So sue me.
L10414	u3520	m232	BUD	You totaled it, huh?
L10413	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not in this thing.
L10412	u3520	m232	BUD	Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
L10411	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
L10409	u3520	m232	BUD	Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
L10408	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You owe me one, Virgil.
L10386	u3520	m232	BUD	Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
L10385	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
L10384	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
L10383	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Now what?
L10382	u3520	m232	BUD	He's jammed the mechanism.
L10346	u3520	m232	BUD	Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
L10345	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
L10339	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	It's trying to communicate.
L10338	u3520	m232	BUD	I think it likes you.
L10327	u3520	m232	BUD	Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
L10326	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	He's got the shakes?
L10320	u3520	m232	BUD	Chill out, Lindsey!!
L10319	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You dumb jarhead motherf--
L10311	u3520	m232	BUD	Lindsey!  Wait a second--
L10310	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
L10292	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
L10291	u3520	m232	BUD	How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
L10290	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
L10289	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
L10288	u3520	m232	BUD	No.
L10287	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
L10286	u3520	m232	BUD	God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
L10285	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
L10284	u3520	m232	BUD	All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
L10283	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
L10282	u3520	m232	BUD	Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
L10281	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, something really important is happening here.
L10280	u3520	m232	BUD	Jesus, Lindsey--
L10270	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
L10269	u3520	m232	BUD	If you say so.  It could be anything.
L10268	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
L10240	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Yeah?  Well I'm not.
L10239	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
L10238	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
L10237	u3520	m232	BUD	The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
L10236	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
L10235	u3520	m232	BUD	What about O-2?
L10234	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
L10233	u3520	m232	BUD	Need some help?
L10232	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
L10231	u3520	m232	BUD	What's the scoop, ace?
L10185	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Cute, Virgil.
L10184	u3520	m232	BUD	Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
L10166	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
L10165	u3520	m232	BUD	What do you think he saw?
L10164	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	But what did he see that made him panic?
L10163	u3520	m232	BUD	His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
L10162	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
L10161	u3520	m232	BUD	Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
L10160	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No.
L10159	u3520	m232	BUD	But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
L10158	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
L10157	u3520	m232	BUD	Fine.  Be that way.
L10156	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
L10155	u3520	m232	BUD	Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
L10043	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
L10042	u3520	m232	BUD	I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
L10041	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
L10040	u3520	m232	BUD	What happened?
L10039	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
L10038	u3520	m232	BUD	"So what about ""Michael"" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?"
L10037	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
L10036	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
L10035	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I haven't worn mine in months.
L10034	u3520	m232	BUD	I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
L10033	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What are you still wearing that for?
L10030	u3520	m232	BUD	Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
L10029	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
L10028	u3520	m232	BUD	No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
L10027	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	That must be it.
L10026	u3520	m232	BUD	I think you were worried about me.
L10025	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
L10024	u3520	m232	BUD	You wanna know what I think?
L10023	u3520	m232	BUD	Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
L10022	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
L10020	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
L10019	u3520	m232	BUD	I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
L10016	u3520	m232	BUD	Who else?
L10015	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
L10014	u3520	m232	BUD	You never did like being called that, did you?
L10013	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not for long.
L10012	u3520	m232	BUD	Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
L9970	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
L9969	u3520	m232	BUD	I'm switching off now.
L9968	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
L9967	u3520	m232	BUD	Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
L9966	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
L9965	u3520	m232	BUD	Your rig?
L9964	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
L9963	u3520	m232	BUD	Wasn't up to me.
L9962	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
L9961	u3520	m232	BUD	Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
L9960	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I can't believe you let them do this!
L10229	u3522	m232	COFFEY	No.
L10228	u3520	m232	BUD	Did you find Wilhite?
L10210	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
L10209	u3520	m232	BUD	Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
L10116	u3520	m232	BUD	Let's go, guys.
L10115	u3522	m232	COFFEY	We'll go in through that large breach.
L10059	u3522	m232	COFFEY	I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
L10058	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
L10057	u3522	m232	COFFEY	I can't afford slack, Brigman.
L10056	u3520	m232	BUD	Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
L10053	u3520	m232	BUD	Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
L10052	u3522	m232	COFFEY	We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
L10474	u3520	m232	BUD	All right.  Do it!
L10473	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
L10472	u3520	m232	BUD	Is that it?  Is this right?
L10466	u3520	m232	BUD	Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
L10465	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Got it. Over.
L10464	u3520	m232	BUD	Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
L10325	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
L10324	u3520	m232	BUD	Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
L10309	u3523	m232	HIPPY	It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
L10308	u3520	m232	BUD	Why bring it here?
L10307	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Come on, man.  What else could it be?
L10247	u3520	m232	BUD	Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
L10246	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Do we just leave him there?
L10245	u3520	m232	BUD	That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
L10244	u3523	m232	HIPPY	That's Perry.
L10188	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Everything is.
L10187	u3520	m232	BUD	Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
L10186	u3523	m232	HIPPY	No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
L10181	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
L10180	u3520	m232	BUD	What's the matter with you?
L10098	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
L10097	u3520	m232	BUD	Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
L9974	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
L9973	u3520	m232	BUD	God, I hate that bitch.
L9972	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Virgil?
L10389	u3521	m232	CATFISH	I can't... make it... podner.
L10388	u3520	m232	BUD	Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
L10302	u3520	m232	BUD	Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
L10301	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Yuh?
L10300	u3520	m232	BUD	'Fish'?
L10141	u3521	m232	CATFISH	It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
L10140	u3520	m232	BUD	He's convulsing!
L10123	u3520	m232	BUD	We're here now.  Let's get her done.
L10122	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
L9918	u3521	m232	CATFISH	That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
L9917	u3520	m232	BUD	Hey, you guys are milking that job.
L10583	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
L10582	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
L10358	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
L10357	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
L10272	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
L10271	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Y'all could be more specific.
L10265	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Missed what?
L10264	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You better not say you missed that.
L10249	u3521	m232	CATFISH	You watch yourself.
L10248	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
L9993	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
L9992	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
L9991	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
L10401	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Give me that!!
L10400	u3523	m232	HIPPY	SHIT!
L10348	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
L10347	u3523	m232	HIPPY	That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
L10277	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
L10276	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Are we talkin' little space friend here?
L10169	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Turn it up, bozo.
L10168	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Quiet!  Quiet!
L10051	u3523	m232	HIPPY	What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
L10050	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Hippy, you pussy.
L10002	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
L10001	u3521	m232	CATFISH	Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
L10315	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
L10314	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
L10313	u3522	m232	COFFEY	You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
L10312	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
L10295	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
L10294	u3522	m232	COFFEY	I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
L10108	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
L10107	u3522	m232	COFFEY	24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
L10106	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	How many are there?
L10105	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
L10094	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Copy that.
L10093	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
L10092	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
L10089	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Wilhite, anything?
L10088	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Neutron counter's not showing very much.
L10087	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Cab One, radiation readings?
L10085	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
L10084	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Cab One, do you see it yet?
L10000	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
L9999	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
L9996	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
L9995	u3522	m232	COFFEY	We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
L9994	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
L9980	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
L9979	u3522	m232	COFFEY	Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
L10517	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What kind of luminous things, Bud?
L10516	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Uh, oh...
L10515	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
L10514	u3523	m232	HIPPY	12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
L10392	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
L10391	u3523	m232	HIPPY	He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
L10374	u3523	m232	HIPPY	That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
L10373	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
L10334	u3523	m232	HIPPY	I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
L10333	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
L10331	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
L10330	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
L10329	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
L10275	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
L10274	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	A non-terrestrial intelligence.
L10183	u3523	m232	HIPPY	We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
L10182	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Figured that out for yourself, did you?
L10078	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
L10077	u3523	m232	HIPPY	1840... 50... 60... 70...
L10076	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What's you depth, Cab Three?
L10075	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
L9988	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
L9987	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
L10366	u3526	m232	MONK	What's the timer set for?
L10365	u3523	m232	HIPPY	You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
L10113	u3523	m232	HIPPY	It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
L10112	u3526	m232	MONK	Getting a reading?
L10103	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
L10102	u3526	m232	MONK	Stand by on the ROV.
L10069	u3526	m232	MONK	Check this out.
L10068	u3523	m232	HIPPY	Hey!
L10065	u3526	m232	MONK	Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
L10064	u3523	m232	HIPPY	How deep?
L10063	u3526	m232	MONK	Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
L10540	u3526	m232	MONK	Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
L10539	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Would we see the flash?
L10535	u3526	m232	MONK	He's hallucinating badly.
L10534	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	What kind of light?
L10529	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
L10528	u3526	m232	MONK	He can still make it.
L10520	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
L10519	u3526	m232	MONK	He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
L10506	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
L10505	u3526	m232	MONK	Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
L10504	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
L10502	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
L10501	u3526	m232	MONK	4800 feet.  It's official.
L9998	u3525	m232	LINDSEY	Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
L9997	u3526	m232	MONK	High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
L23798	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
L23797	u3584	m236	ROBY	Do you remember the pyramid?
L23796	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	... I don't know...
L23795	u3584	m236	ROBY	Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
L23792	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
L23791	u3584	m236	ROBY	Are you in pain?
L23373	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
L23372	u3584	m236	ROBY	There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
L23371	u3584	m236	ROBY	Or something will be able to see us.
L23370	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
L23349	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
L23348	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engines off.
L23347	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Kill drive engines.
L23346	u3584	m236	ROBY	Locked.
L23321	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
L23320	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Hell, we're equipped --
L23319	u3584	m236	ROBY	If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
L23259	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
L23258	u3584	m236	ROBY	Cattle ranch!
L23257	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
L23245	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, it's you all right.
L23244	u3584	m236	ROBY	I feel like shit...
L23243	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Is that you, Roby?
L23242	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh... God... am I cold...
L23822	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
L23821	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Breathe deeply.
L23820	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
L23819	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's wrong?
L23802	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
L23801	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
L23794	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	God I'm hungry.
L23793	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
L23790	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
L23789	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Don't you remember?
L23788	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Wretched.  What happened to me?
L23787	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How do you feel, Dell?
L23554	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
L23553	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
L23552	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
L23551	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Are you okay in there?
L23549	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Take care.
L23548	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
L23545	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No, I want to go in.
L23544	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
L23536	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you see anything in the hole?
L23535	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
L23534	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can we come up?
L23531	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Sure.
L23530	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You want to try?
L23529	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Maybe we can get in by the top.
L23494	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What is it, I can't --
L23493	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
L23492	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Take a look.
L23491	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What is it?
L23490	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm on my way.
L23489	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
L23488	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's up?
L23487	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
L23486	u3585	m236	STANDARD	This is Chaz.
L23444	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	But functioning.
L23443	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just machinery.
L23437	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, you'll follow me.
L23436	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'll go first.
L23429	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
L23428	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Looks like a derelict.
L23427	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
L23401	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Receiving.
L23400	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
L23386	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
L23385	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Close enough to walk to!
L23345	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
L23344	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then take her down.
L23343	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	It's... basalt.  Rock.
L23342	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Is it solid?
L23341	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
L23340	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's the terrain down there?
L23339	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
L23336	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
L23335	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Activate lifter quads.
L23328	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I'll see what I can do.
L23327	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
L23323	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
L23322	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
L23313	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
L23312	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Gravity?
L23311	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Yeah.  Two hours.
L23310	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Any rotation?
L23307	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	That's what I'm going to do.
L23306	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you get it a little closer?
L23273	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
L23272	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Where the hell are we?
L23271	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I got it.  Oh boy.
L23270	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell, plot our location.
L23269	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	I don't recognize that constellation.
L23265	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, scan the whole sky.
L23264	u3579	m236	BROUSSARD	Where's Irth?
L23294	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
L23293	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
L23290	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	Unknown.
L23289	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, what language was that?
L23288	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Play it for us, please.
L23287	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have recorded the transmission.
L23285	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	A voice transmission.
L23284	u3585	m236	STANDARD	A transmission?
L23283	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
L23282	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
L24123	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
L24122	u3584	m236	ROBY	Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
L23523	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
L23522	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
L23521	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yes!
L23292	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
L23291	u3584	m236	ROBY	Unknown!  What do you mean?
L23281	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
L23280	u3584	m236	ROBY	What?  <u>Why</u>?
L23279	u3580	m236	COMPUTER	I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
L23980	u3581	m236	FAUST	It's still in the ship?
L23979	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
L23978	u3581	m236	FAUST	Dead!
L23977	u3584	m236	ROBY	Dead.
L23976	u3581	m236	FAUST	What happened?  Where's Sandy?
L23921	u3581	m236	FAUST	All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
L23920	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where does that go?
L23885	u3581	m236	FAUST	Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
L23884	u3584	m236	ROBY	What happened to the lights?
L23883	u3581	m236	FAUST	That way.
L23882	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay.
L23879	u3581	m236	FAUST	Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
L23878	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where's it coming from?
L23850	u3584	m236	ROBY	We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
L23849	u3581	m236	FAUST	We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
L23833	u3581	m236	FAUST	Shit...
L23832	u3584	m236	ROBY	But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
L23817	u3584	m236	ROBY	I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
L23816	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
L23815	u3584	m236	ROBY	You know what they make this stuff out of?
L23814	u3581	m236	FAUST	It grows on you.
L23813	u3584	m236	ROBY	You like this shit?
L23543	u3584	m236	ROBY	"It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  ""... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... ""  And that's all it could translate."
L23542	u3581	m236	FAUST	What do you mean?
L23541	u3584	m236	ROBY	The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
L23540	u3581	m236	FAUST	Why, what's wrong?
L23539	u3584	m236	ROBY	Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
L23538	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yes?  What is it?
L23520	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
L23519	u3581	m236	FAUST	Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
L23463	u3584	m236	ROBY	Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
L23462	u3581	m236	FAUST	What?
L23461	u3584	m236	ROBY	<u>He</u> died.
L23379	u3584	m236	ROBY	How's it coming on the engines?
L23378	u3581	m236	FAUST	Yeah!
L23377	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hello, Faust!
L23362	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.  Talk to you.
L23361	u3584	m236	ROBY	Well, get started.
L23360	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hard to say.
L23359	u3584	m236	ROBY	How long to fix?
L23355	u3584	m236	ROBY	Has the hull been breached?
L23354	u3581	m236	FAUST	Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
L23942	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Right.
L23941	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
L23925	u3582	m236	HUNTER	-- And the cooling unit on the other.
L23924	u3581	m236	FAUST	That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
L23838	u3581	m236	FAUST	The water will still recycle.
L23837	u3582	m236	HUNTER	And then we run out of food and oxygen.
L23827	u3581	m236	FAUST	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
L23826	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh, no.  Oh, no.
L23804	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
L23803	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
L23624	u3581	m236	FAUST	Is it alive?
L23623	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh -- God -- oh --
L23610	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
L23609	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hurt!  How?
L23608	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
L23607	u3581	m236	FAUST	What the hell's going on?
L23996	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And be right back.
L23995	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right. 
L23994	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
L23991	u3581	m236	FAUST	You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
L23990	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, I don't want us separated.
L23989	u3581	m236	FAUST	There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
L23973	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.
L23972	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
L23971	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
L23927	u3581	m236	FAUST	Poison gas...
L23926	u3585	m236	STANDARD	So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
L23903	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well we better do something.
L23902	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
L23873	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
L23872	u3581	m236	FAUST	It's clear.
L23864	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I hope not.
L23863	u3581	m236	FAUST	Might even incinerate the damn thing.
L23844	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
L23843	u3581	m236	FAUST	We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
L23842	u3585	m236	STANDARD	So does anybody have any suggestions?
L23812	u3581	m236	FAUST	I kind of like it.
L23811	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
L23775	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
L23774	u3581	m236	FAUST	This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
L23762	u3581	m236	FAUST	The engines are fixed.
L23761	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What?
L23760	u3581	m236	FAUST	Hey, guess what?
L23631	u3581	m236	FAUST	Here, let me try.
L23630	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's really on there tight.
L23470	u3581	m236	FAUST	Right.
L23469	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
L23468	u3581	m236	FAUST	Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
L23467	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And when will you be ready to do that?
L23466	u3581	m236	FAUST	Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
L23465	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
L23358	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Damn it!  How long to fix?
L23357	u3581	m236	FAUST	Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
L23831	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
L23830	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
L23706	u3582	m236	HUNTER	You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
L23705	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
L23690	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
L23689	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It makes me sick to see him like that.
L23679	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
L23678	u3582	m236	HUNTER	But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
L23677	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
L23667	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It's eating a hole in the floor!
L23666	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	God, that smoke's poisonous!
L23661	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
L23660	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
L23659	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
L23658	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
L23650	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
L23649	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
L23648	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How does he breathe?
L23647	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
L23646	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Where did it come from?
L23640	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
L23639	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
L24100	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can't, the acid will pour out!
L24099	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The flamethrower!
L24098	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let me go first; you stay behind me.
L24097	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
L24081	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
L24080	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
L24078	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
L24077	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It will be.
L24073	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
L24072	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Should we go outside and bring him in?
L24071	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
L24057	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
L24056	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The flamethrower needs more fuel.
L24055	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
L24051	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
L24050	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Good!  That's good!
L24049	u3585	m236	STANDARD	If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
L24031	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's time for drastic remedies.
L24030	u3582	m236	HUNTER	<u>How</u>?
L24029	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
L24028	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
L24021	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Does anybody know what happened?
L24020	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh my God.
L24019	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got six hours left.
L23988	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
L23987	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
L23986	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
L23982	u3582	m236	HUNTER	At least it can't get up here now.
L23981	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
L23936	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Got a better idea?
L23935	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Sounds like a rough one.
L23934	u3585	m236	STANDARD	While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
L23929	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
L23928	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
L23905	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Don't be an idiot.
L23904	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
L23866	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How do we locate the creature?
L23865	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
L23852	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
L23851	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
L23742	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.
L23741	u3582	m236	HUNTER	The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
L23740	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can you do anything for him?
L23739	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yes.
L23738	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Still unconscious?
L23737	u3582	m236	HUNTER	He's running a fever.
L23736	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How's Broussard?
L23735	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Yes?
L23723	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Maybe we can catch it.
L23722	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
L23721	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
L23720	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
L23719	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Now we're in for it.
L23717	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Maybe it wasn't always dead.
L23716	u3582	m236	HUNTER	How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
L23715	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
L23714	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What do you mean?
L23713	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
L23712	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'll come with you.
L23711	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
L23672	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Careful, don't get under it!
L23671	u3585	m236	STANDARD	There.  Should be coming through about there.
L23636	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Ask him.
L23635	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Hey now, what is this?
L23628	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It wouldn't come.
L23627	u3582	m236	HUNTER	That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
L23253	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
L23252	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Boy, that's terrific.
L23251	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's over, Hunter.
L24089	u3584	m236	ROBY	Thanks for the thought. 
L24088	u3582	m236	HUNTER	If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
L24087	u3584	m236	ROBY	Is it armed?
L24086	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
L24083	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
L24082	u3584	m236	ROBY	"Isn't ""bait"" the word you used?"
L24076	u3584	m236	ROBY	I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
L24075	u3582	m236	HUNTER	This should do it.
L24054	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's not going to work.
L24053	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can use the flamethrower.
L24052	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
L24045	u3584	m236	ROBY	Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
L24044	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
L24041	u3584	m236	ROBY	And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
L24040	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Blow the ship up?
L24035	u3584	m236	ROBY	I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
L24034	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
L24011	u3584	m236	ROBY	You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
L24010	u3582	m236	HUNTER	... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
L24004	u3584	m236	ROBY	And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
L24003	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
L24002	u3584	m236	ROBY	In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
L24001	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Recognizable!  In that?
L23993	u3582	m236	HUNTER	We sure need this flamethrower.
L23992	u3584	m236	ROBY	Don't count on it.
L23975	u3584	m236	ROBY	It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
L23974	u3582	m236	HUNTER	You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
L23710	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
L23709	u3584	m236	ROBY	What common objects?
L23702	u3584	m236	ROBY	The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
L23701	u3582	m236	HUNTER	That must have been when he got it.
L23698	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey!  what about the film?
L23697	u3582	m236	HUNTER	This is horrible.
L23676	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think it's fizzled out.
L23675	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What's happening up here?
L23657	u3582	m236	HUNTER	It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
L23656	u3584	m236	ROBY	I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
L23655	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Oh... God...
L23654	u3584	m236	ROBY	It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
L23653	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What is it -- I can't tell anything --
L23652	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look at that.
L23643	u3584	m236	ROBY	I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
L23642	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
L23604	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
L23603	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh no.
L23598	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Three blips!  They're coming this way!
L23597	u3584	m236	ROBY	How many?
L23596	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
L23565	u3584	m236	ROBY	Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
L23564	u3582	m236	HUNTER	Why, you chickenshit bastard --
L23563	u3584	m236	ROBY	We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
L23562	u3582	m236	HUNTER	But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
L23561	u3584	m236	ROBY	We're not going anywhere.
L23560	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What do you mean, no?
L23559	u3584	m236	ROBY	No.
L23558	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
L23528	u3584	m236	ROBY	The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
L23527	u3582	m236	HUNTER	What?  What was that?
L23512	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I'm trying.
L23511	u3584	m236	ROBY	Can you get them back?
L23510	u3582	m236	HUNTER	I've completely lost their signal.
L23509	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what's wrong?
L23956	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
L23955	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Okay.
L23954	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
L23953	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're getting pretty close now.
L23952	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's get moving with this net.
L23951	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're on the next level up.
L23950	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Are they close?
L23949	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
L23861	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
L23860	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
L23859	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
L23858	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
L23857	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
L23856	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
L23855	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's the one about the albatross, right?
L23854	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	"I was thinking of a line from an old poem: ""Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.""  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship."
L23853	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I thought I'd find you here.
L23848	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
L23847	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	And what do we do when we find it?
L23846	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Room by room, corridor by corridor.
L23845	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	How?
L23836	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got about a week left, right?
L23835	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
L23834	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
L23807	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Maybe we could write it together.
L23806	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The commander normally has first publication rights.
L23805	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	"I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it ""The Snark Log."""
L23800	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We're going into the freezers now.
L23799	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
L23758	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
L23757	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
L23708	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
L23707	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That sounds a little fanciful...
L23688	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It appears to have healed itself.
L23687	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Is it still dripping?
L23686	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, thank God... just missed him.
L23683	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
L23682	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
L23681	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Yes, thank heaven.
L23680	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's stopped?
L23634	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's let the machine work on him.
L23633	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
L23595	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
L23594	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What is it?
L23593	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It won't come -- it's stuck.
L23592	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
L23591	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Oh God, oh God no.
L23590	u3585	m236	STANDARD	<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
L23589	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	<u>What is it</u>?
L23584	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Can you see anything?
L23583	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, it's coming.
L23582	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
L23581	u3585	m236	STANDARD	There, it caught!
L23578	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
L23577	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
L23576	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
L23575	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
L23569	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Sun will be down in a minute.
L23568	u3585	m236	STANDARD	If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
L23557	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
L23556	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What'd he say?
L23514	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
L23513	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	This looks ancient.
L23497	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
L23496	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
L23431	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Who knows?
L23430	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Air lock?
L23421	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
L23420	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How far?
L23419	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It's close, real close.
L23414	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	My signal's fading.
L23413	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's wrong?
L23408	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You lead.
L23407	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	That way.
L23403	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
L23402	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Receiving.
L23375	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
L23374	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
L23369	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
L23368	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
L23303	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Dell -- show me that on a screen.
L23302	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
L23300	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
L23299	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What's the frequency?
L23298	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
L23297	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	First contact...
L23263	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Feast your eyes.
L23262	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
L23810	u3584	m236	ROBY	Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
L23809	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
L23808	u3584	m236	ROBY	First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
L23756	u3584	m236	ROBY	Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
L23755	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
L23752	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
L23751	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah?
L23750	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	We do know that.
L23745	u3584	m236	ROBY	About four hours.
L23744	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
L23696	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
L23695	u3584	m236	ROBY	That tube must be depositing it in him.
L23694	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
L23384	u3584	m236	ROBY	Close...
L23383	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
L23332	u3584	m236	ROBY	Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
L23331	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
L23325	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look --
L23324	u3583	m236	MELKONIS	Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
L24113	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Kill me...
L24112	u3584	m236	ROBY	What can I do?
L24111	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No good... it's eaten too much of me...
L24110	u3584	m236	ROBY	But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
L24109	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No... don't...
L24108	u3584	m236	ROBY	I'll get you out of there.
L24107	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
L24106	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Look...
L24105	u3584	m236	ROBY	What did it do to you?
L24104	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Kill me...
L24093	u3584	m236	ROBY	Kablooey.
L24092	u3585	m236	STANDARD	And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
L24091	u3584	m236	ROBY	And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
L24090	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
L24085	u3584	m236	ROBY	Who gets the privilege?
L24084	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
L24068	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
L24067	u3584	m236	ROBY	So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
L24064	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
L24063	u3584	m236	ROBY	<u>Hey watch it</u>!
L24062	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Here, carry these.
L24061	u3584	m236	ROBY	You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
L24048	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
L24047	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah... I forgot.
L24046	u3585	m236	STANDARD	No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
L24043	u3584	m236	ROBY	Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
L24042	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
L24039	u3584	m236	ROBY	Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
L24038	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That'll blow the ship up.
L24037	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
L24036	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's hear it.
L24033	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
L24032	u3584	m236	ROBY	It was time for that a couple days ago.
L24027	u3584	m236	ROBY	No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
L24026	u3585	m236	STANDARD	At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
L24025	u3584	m236	ROBY	Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
L24024	u3584	m236	ROBY	No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
L24023	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can we get to him?
L24022	u3584	m236	ROBY	I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
L24013	u3584	m236	ROBY	... More spores coming.
L24012	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Which presumably means...
L24009	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
L24008	u3584	m236	ROBY	This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
L24006	u3584	m236	ROBY	So the next step should be --
L24005	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
L24000	u3584	m236	ROBY	I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
L23999	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
L23998	u3584	m236	ROBY	Can you make out any pattern in all that?
L23985	u3584	m236	ROBY	Nothing.
L23984	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What's that supposed to mean?
L23983	u3584	m236	ROBY	Two down, four to go.
L23969	u3584	m236	ROBY	By eating our food supplies.
L23968	u3585	m236	STANDARD	How did it get so <u>big</u>?
L23948	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Right now let's keep it closed.
L23947	u3584	m236	ROBY	That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
L23938	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's be democratic.
L23937	u3584	m236	ROBY	So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
L23931	u3585	m236	STANDARD	The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
L23930	u3584	m236	ROBY	Are you <u>crazy</u>?
L23916	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What do you think?  Now we go in.
L23915	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what?
L23913	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Go ahead, Jay.
L23912	u3584	m236	ROBY	This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
L23909	u3584	m236	ROBY	You win.
L23908	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
L23907	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
L23900	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I guess we open the door and net it.
L23899	u3584	m236	ROBY	Now what?
L23898	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
L23897	u3584	m236	ROBY	What's it doing, having a seizure?
L23895	u3584	m236	ROBY	We're coming!
L23894	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Food-storage room!
L23893	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where are you?
L23892	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
L23891	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yes!
L23870	u3584	m236	ROBY	Even simple.
L23869	u3585	m236	STANDARD	These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
L23841	u3584	m236	ROBY	But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
L23840	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
L23839	u3584	m236	ROBY	We won't need it then.
L23784	u3585	m236	STANDARD	That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
L23783	u3584	m236	ROBY	We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
L23782	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
L23781	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Quit complaining; we're in space.
L23780	u3584	m236	ROBY	That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
L23778	u3584	m236	ROBY	With great pleasure.
L23777	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
L23776	u3584	m236	ROBY	We made it!  Damn, we made it!
L23771	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's take her into an escape orbit.
L23770	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engaged.
L23767	u3584	m236	ROBY	Up one kilometer, Jay.
L23766	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Take us up.
L23754	u3585	m236	STANDARD	They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
L23753	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where did the parasites come from?
L23749	u3584	m236	ROBY	If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
L23748	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
L23747	u3584	m236	ROBY	Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
L23746	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
L23728	u3584	m236	ROBY	Is that its mouth?
L23727	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
L23700	u3584	m236	ROBY	Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
L23699	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What film?
L23645	u3585	m236	STANDARD	He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
L23644	u3584	m236	ROBY	Would somebody fill me in?
L23638	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.
L23637	u3584	m236	ROBY	I understand why you did that.
L23620	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
L23619	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
L23618	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We can't leave him out here, open the door.
L23617	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
L23616	u3585	m236	STANDARD	You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
L23615	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
L23614	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
L23613	u3585	m236	STANDARD	We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
L23612	u3584	m236	ROBY	Here, Chaz.
L23602	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
L23601	u3584	m236	ROBY	Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
L23600	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
L23599	u3584	m236	ROBY	Hey, can you guys hear me?
L23485	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
L23484	u3584	m236	ROBY	This ship is full of cat hair.
L23483	u3584	m236	ROBY	But why draw it on the wall?
L23482	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
L23481	u3584	m236	ROBY	What would you say that was supposed to mean?
L23480	u3585	m236	STANDARD	I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
L23479	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh well... you know me.
L23478	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Still worried?
L23477	u3584	m236	ROBY	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
L23476	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Find anything we missed?
L23458	u3584	m236	ROBY	What killed it?
L23457	u3585	m236	STANDARD	But?
L23456	u3584	m236	ROBY	I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
L23455	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin?
L23424	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
L23423	u3584	m236	ROBY	Found what?
L23422	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Martin, uh, we've found it.
L23411	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
L23410	u3584	m236	ROBY	Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
L23396	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
L23395	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
L23394	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Anything else?
L23393	u3584	m236	ROBY	Not a one.  It's dead.
L23392	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Any microorganisms?
L23391	u3584	m236	ROBY	Zero.  Dry as a bone.
L23390	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Good!  Moisture content?
L23389	u3584	m236	ROBY	Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
L23388	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
L23387	u3584	m236	ROBY	10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
L23382	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
L23381	u3584	m236	ROBY	Yeah, okay. 
L23353	u3584	m236	ROBY	Engine room, what happened?
L23352	u3585	m236	STANDARD	What the hell happened?
L23338	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Turn on navigation lights.
L23337	u3584	m236	ROBY	Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
L23330	u3584	m236	ROBY	No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
L23329	u3585	m236	STANDARD	It's out of focus.
L23296	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Well, it's finally happened.
L23295	u3584	m236	ROBY	Oh my God.
L23278	u3584	m236	ROBY	Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
L23277	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Let's hear it.
L23276	u3584	m236	ROBY	Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
L23275	u3585	m236	STANDARD	This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
L23267	u3585	m236	STANDARD	Sandy, contact traffic control.
L23266	u3584	m236	ROBY	Where are we?
L23261	u3584	m236	ROBY	Right.  Fire up all systems.
L23260	u3585	m236	STANDARD	All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
L27233	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Yeah...
L27232	u3597	m237	REVNA	Better?
L27229	u3597	m237	REVNA	Do you want a tablet?
L27228	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
L27227	u3597	m237	REVNA	What is it?
L27205	u3597	m237	REVNA	Sure.
L27204	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
L27188	u3597	m237	REVNA	Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
L27187	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
L27186	u3597	m237	REVNA	Headache?  Dehydration?
L27116	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Wait a minute.
L27115	u3598	m237	YORK	Let's get back and call this in.
L27112	u3598	m237	YORK	Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
L27111	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
L27110	u3598	m237	YORK	I told you we... what's that?
L27109	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
L27108	u3598	m237	YORK	Yeah, it's fine.
L27107	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
L27106	u3598	m237	YORK	Is it dead?
L27105	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	It's a rhino.
L27103	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
L27102	u3598	m237	YORK	Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
L27068	u3598	m237	YORK	Do you wanna head back and call it in?
L27067	u3586	m237	ACKLAND	Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
L27140	u3595	m237	MINH	Yep...
L27139	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	Minh...
L27137	u3595	m237	MINH	Oh man...
L27136	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
L27032	u3595	m237	MINH	Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
L27031	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
L27030	u3595	m237	MINH	Thanks.
L27029	u3587	m237	BEAUVAIS	Nice howitzer you've got there.
L27560	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Keep trying!
L27559	u3588	m237	CASSIE	I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
L27557	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Get her on-line.  Now!
L27556	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
L27555	u3596	m237	PARSONS	And?
L27554	u3588	m237	CASSIE	I found it...
L27552	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
L27551	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
L27550	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Where is she?
L27533	u3596	m237	PARSONS	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
L27532	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Are you alright?
L27467	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We're not gonna make it, are we?
L27466	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Give or take.
L27405	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Too many.
L27404	u3588	m237	CASSIE	How many of them are there?
L27401	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We're what!?
L27400	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
L27399	u3588	m237	CASSIE	What's happening?
L27398	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Seal everything now!
L27058	u3588	m237	CASSIE	It's on the board.
L27057	u3596	m237	PARSONS	A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
L27056	u3588	m237	CASSIE	What do you need?
L27052	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Okay, give me the numbers.
L27051	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
L27011	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
L27010	u3596	m237	PARSONS	We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
L27009	u3588	m237	CASSIE	A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
L26987	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Better tell the boss.
L26986	u3596	m237	PARSONS	That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
L27007	u3588	m237	CASSIE	No, but I got something that might interest you.
L27006	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
L27005	u3588	m237	CASSIE	You win some, you loose some.
L27004	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
L27003	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
L27002	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Shit.  When?
L27001	u3588	m237	CASSIE	MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
L27589	u3588	m237	CASSIE	But...
L27588	u3593	m237	HIROKO	If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
L27507	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
L27506	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Deal.
L27505	u3588	m237	CASSIE	About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
L27504	u3593	m237	HIROKO	How much air-time have I got?
L27484	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
L27483	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Oh, man...
L27460	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Do it.
L27459	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Not yet.
L27458	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Has anybody talked to them?
L27457	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
L27454	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What's our weapons situation?
L27453	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
L27446	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Nooooo!
L27445	u3588	m237	CASSIE	It's too late!
L27239	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Force the door.
L27238	u3588	m237	CASSIE	The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
L27237	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What's going on?
L27060	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Match it!
L27059	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Picking up velocity.
L27046	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
L27045	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
L27044	u3593	m237	HIROKO	When?
L27022	u3588	m237	CASSIE	We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
L27021	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Where're they headed?
L27013	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
L27012	u3588	m237	CASSIE	Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
L27595	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Couple more seconds!
L27594	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
L27349	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
L27348	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Is it still moving?
L27347	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	It's alright, it's cool...
L27346	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
L27345	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I dunno.  Might be a glitch.
L27344	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	How?
L27343	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Wait.  Lost it.
L27342	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Yeah, I...
L27341	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
L27340	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Just behind us, over to the right.
L27339	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What?  Where?
L27338	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I'm picking up another signal.
L27337	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What's wrong?
L27336	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Hold it, hold it...
L27330	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
L27329	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Still got him?
L27327	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Yeah, I got it.
L27326	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Careful of that edging there...
L27325	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Anything you say, Mammacitta.
L27324	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	But I'm going first...
L27323	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	I'll come with you.
L27322	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	What?
L27321	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Alright, okay.  Look...
L27319	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
L27318	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What the hell are you doing?
L27317	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
L27316	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
L27315	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Forget it, man.
L27314	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
L27313	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
L27301	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Just got a reading...
L27300	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	What?
L27299	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Whoa, wait a minute...
L27298	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	That's a fact.
L27297	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
L27296	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
L27295	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
L27294	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	One of 'em must have escaped.
L27293	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Take a look at this.
L27292	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	What?
L27291	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Hey, Guttierez?
L27279	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	I dunno.
L27278	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Something spooking the rhinos?
L27277	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
L27276	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Yeah?
L27275	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	De Vries?
L27274	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
L27273	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Listen to what?
L27271	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
L27270	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
L27269	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
L27268	u3589	m237	DE VRIES	C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
L27260	u3593	m237	HIROKO	One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
L27259	u3590	m237	DILLER	Okay.
L27258	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
L27250	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Where does that lead to?
L27249	u3590	m237	DILLER	Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
L27236	u3590	m237	DILLER	York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
L27235	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What happened?
L27042	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Thanks.
L27041	u3590	m237	DILLER	Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
L27513	u3593	m237	HIROKO	How tight are these shafts?
L27512	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
L27509	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sounds great.
L27508	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
L27493	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Uh-huh.
L27492	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Is this the suit?
L27490	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Which mean physically going outside.
L27489	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
L27488	u3593	m237	HIROKO	That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
L27456	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Auto-shop?
L27455	u3591	m237	DRISCOLL	Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
L27214	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
L27213	u3594	m237	KAMEN	And...?
L27164	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Appreciate that.
L27163	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
L27162	u3594	m237	KAMEN	She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
L27161	u3592	m237	GUTTIEREZ	What's the problem?
L27160	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
L27575	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
L27574	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Okay, I'm out of here!
L27571	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
L27570	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Okay, we're in business.
L27524	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
L27523	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
L27522	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
L27521	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
L27520	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Thanks.
L27516	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
L27515	u3596	m237	PARSONS	There's still time to back-out.
L27511	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What?  Why?
L27510	u3596	m237	PARSONS	It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
L27470	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Well... try the headset.
L27469	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
L27464	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Looks like it.
L27463	u3593	m237	HIROKO	They knocked out the external feeds.
L27452	u3593	m237	HIROKO	How many... how many people are missing?
L27451	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
L27252	u3593	m237	HIROKO	You've checked that end?
L27251	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
L27248	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What is that?
L27247	u3596	m237	PARSONS	It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
L27055	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
L27054	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Compensate!
L27053	u3596	m237	PARSONS	They've changed their heading again.
L27048	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
L27047	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Already working on it.
L27025	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
L27024	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
L27016	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Done it already.  Nothing matches.
L27015	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
L27014	u3596	m237	PARSONS	That's what we thought.
L27616	u3593	m237	HIROKO	No!
L27615	u3594	m237	KAMEN	You have to...
L27614	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I... I can't!
L27613	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
L27612	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What can I do?
L27611	u3594	m237	KAMEN	They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
L27435	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Don't wait for me!
L27434	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Hurry it up.
L27423	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Detour.  Other way's blocked...
L27422	u3593	m237	HIROKO	That's the wrong way!
L27393	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
L27392	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What?
L27267	u3594	m237	KAMEN	What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
L27266	u3593	m237	HIROKO	So, what do you think?
L27256	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
L27255	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
L27207	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
L27206	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Do you believe him?
L27178	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
L27177	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Think I spoke too soon...
L27173	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What do you mean?
L27172	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
L27171	u3593	m237	HIROKO	When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
L27170	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Agreed.
L27169	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
L27154	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Hold on...
L27153	u3594	m237	KAMEN	I've found Ackland!
L27152	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Check out the tent.
L27151	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Yeah.  Somebody won.
L27100	u3594	m237	KAMEN	There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
L27099	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
L27098	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
L27096	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
L27095	u3594	m237	KAMEN	'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
L27094	u3593	m237	HIROKO	First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
L27093	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
L27092	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Any luck raising Ackland's party?
L27090	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Want some?
L27089	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Seltzer?
L27088	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Real man' drink.
L27087	u3594	m237	KAMEN	What is that?
L27085	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
L27084	u3593	m237	HIROKO	What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
L27083	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Only six?
L27082	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Six month stint on Datus.
L27081	u3594	m237	KAMEN	And before that?
L27080	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Four.
L27079	u3594	m237	KAMEN	How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
L27078	u3593	m237	HIROKO	Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
L27077	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Is that a fact.
L27076	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
L27075	u3593	m237	HIROKO	No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
L27074	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Not too much of the socializing type, then?
L27073	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
L27072	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
L27071	u3593	m237	HIROKO	I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
L27070	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
L27035	u3593	m237	HIROKO	We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
L27034	u3594	m237	KAMEN	See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
L27310	u3596	m237	PARSONS	You got it, cowboy.
L27309	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Give me a yell is something happens.
L27308	u3596	m237	PARSONS	'Bout five minutes.
L27307	u3594	m237	KAMEN	What time's sundown?
L27306	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
L27305	u3594	m237	KAMEN	You should hit the sack, too.
L27304	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
L27303	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
L27302	u3594	m237	KAMEN	How's it going?
L27020	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Tactical nukes, maybe?
L27019	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
L27018	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Jesus.
L27000	u3594	m237	KAMEN	Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
L26999	u3596	m237	PARSONS	Where'd you leave them?
L41091	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Get on! Anastasia, get on!
L41090	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	Hurry, Grandmama!
L41067	u3674	m242	TATIANA	When you're older . . .
L41066	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	"Together in Paris! Oh, when can we be ""together in Paris?!"
L41065	u3674	m242	TATIANA	It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
L41064	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
L41063	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I know, but I had to because . . .
L41062	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
L41061	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	How to read.
L41060	u3674	m242	TATIANA	What were you showing her?
L41059	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I was showing Sonya something . . .
L41058	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Why were you so late tonight
L41132	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then come find me.
L41131	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
L41130	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
L41129	u3670	m242	GREGOR	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
L41128	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have to go now, before it gets light.
L41123	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm not sure but look. . .
L41122	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Where is your home, Anya?
L41117	u3667	m242	ANYA	No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
L41116	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Are you running away?
L41592	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
L41591	u3667	m242	ANYA	Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
L41590	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
L41586	u3667	m242	ANYA	Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
L41585	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41584	u3667	m242	ANYA	Poor Meetoo!
L41583	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41582	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
L41397	u3667	m242	ANYA	Not you. Him.
L41396	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I shant!
L41395	u3667	m242	ANYA	You'll laugh.
L41394	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Come out! I can do alterations.
L41393	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I look ridiculous!
L41383	u3667	m242	ANYA	You must have.
L41382	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Did I tell you that?
L41373	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
L41372	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We're just going to refresh your memory...
L41368	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
L41367	u3667	m242	ANYA	Who's Sophie?
L41366	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
L41356	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm fine.
L41355	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Is everyone all right?
L41348	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
L41347	u3667	m242	ANYA	Noooo....
L41242	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
L41241	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
L41201	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Good day!
L41200	u3667	m242	ANYA	Well, I don't have any money . . .
L41199	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
L41198	u3667	m242	ANYA	I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
L41197	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Who did you hear it from?
L41633	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'll never let go!
L41632	u3667	m242	ANYA	Don't let me go!
L41621	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya... where are we?
L41620	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri?
L41559	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
L41497	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
L41496	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No! Well, yes, but
L41495	u3667	m242	ANYA	Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
L41494	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya, wait!
L41486	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Don't be
L41485	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm so scared...
L41447	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
L41446	u3667	m242	ANYA	Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
L41445	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Nervous?
L41434	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's okay. Didn't hurt..
L41433	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh! I'm sorry...
L41412	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
L41411	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry.
L41410	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
L41409	u3667	m242	ANYA	I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
L41408	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
L41407	u3667	m242	ANYA	Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
L41406	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Sad?
L41405	u3667	m242	ANYA	It's so beautiful ... and sad.
L41400	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's not you - it's the dress!
L41399	u3667	m242	ANYA	You said you wouldn't laugh!
L41389	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
L41388	u3667	m242	ANYA	What a beautiful ship!
L41386	u3667	m242	ANYA	The dessert fork!
L41385	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's the best fork of all
L41384	u3667	m242	ANYA	...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
L41381	u3667	m242	ANYA	Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
L41380	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Every Russian family has one..
L41371	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You are the Princess.
L41370	u3667	m242	ANYA	You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
L41354	u3667	m242	ANYA	You shouldn't have pushed us!
L41353	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You must enjoy causing me pain!
L41351	u3667	m242	ANYA	No!
L41350	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on!
L41346	u3667	m242	ANYA	HUH?!
L41345	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Now just get off the train.
L41344	u3667	m242	ANYA	Forged papers! Now, what?!
L41342	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Trying... to... breathe...
L41341	u3667	m242	ANYA	Just what do you think you're doing?!
L41340	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why?
L41339	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on up!
L41334	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
L41333	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm going to stretch my legs
L41318	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I was all out of dynamite!
L41317	u3667	m242	ANYA	By pulling my hair?!
L41316	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
L41315	u3667	m242	ANYA	Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
L41314	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
L41248	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
L41247	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You never thought of the possibility?
L41245	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
L41244	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have my reasons.
L41243	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Why do you want to go to Paris?
L41239	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
L41238	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
L41237	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
L41236	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
L41235	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What happened to your parents?
L41234	u3669	m242	DMITRI	People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
L41222	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Who are you?!
L41221	u3667	m242	ANYA	AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
L41195	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
L41194	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
L41193	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Ouch!  That really hurt!
L41605	u3674	m242	TATIANA	And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
L41604	u3667	m242	ANYA	I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
L41602	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Yes, you do. You do.
L41601	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
L41600	u3674	m242	TATIANA	This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
L41599	u3667	m242	ANYA	And this is my future. This is who I am!
L41598	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
L41597	u3667	m242	ANYA	I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
L41596	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Is it? Is this what you want?
L41595	u3667	m242	ANYA	If I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
L41594	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
L41593	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why does everyone have to act that way?
L41589	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
L41588	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri didn't want the money?
L41579	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
L41578	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
L41577	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't you, child?
L41533	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
L41532	u3667	m242	ANYA	No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
L41531	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
L41525	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
L41524	u3667	m242	ANYA	... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
L41519	u3667	m242	ANYA	THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
L41518	u3674	m242	TATIANA	PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
L41514	u3667	m242	ANYA	I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
L41513	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Do you remember this?
L41512	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
L41511	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Who are you, child?
L41474	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Shut up!
L41473	u3668	m242	BARTOK	PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
L41431	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
L41430	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
L41427	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
L41426	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
L41417	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
L41416	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
L41415	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok... a question.
L41414	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting a chest cold..
L41361	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
L41360	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
L41288	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
L41287	u3668	m242	BARTOK	You'd lose your security deposit?
L41286	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
L41281	u3668	m242	BARTOK	"My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said ""Curses were made to be broken"". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound..."
L41280	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I cursed then all!
L41279	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
L41275	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	How do you know?
L41274	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Trust me, it's her!
L41272	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
L41271	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
L41270	u3668	m242	BARTOK	So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
L41268	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
L41267	u3668	m242	BARTOK	No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
L41266	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
L41264	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
L41263	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
L41262	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What?
L41565	u3669	m242	DMITRI	She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
L41564	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	So where will you go?
L41563	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Watch me.
L41562	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
L41470	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
L41469	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you mean?
L41468	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
L41466	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you feeling all right?
L41464	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
L41439	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It worked in Odessa...
L41438	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"The ""Odessa Dunk""?"
L41437	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"If I used the word ""bleak"" I would be optimistic."
L41436	u3669	m242	DMITRI	How is our current financial status?
L41377	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah! Let us begin!
L41376	u3669	m242	DMITRI	See? The Princess is under there ...
L41331	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Pray he's color-blind...
L41330	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	What do we do now?
L41325	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
L41324	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
L41323	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
L41322	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're a princess...
L41309	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness""."
L41308	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Wake up, your highness - we should start getting used to saying it.
L41307	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
L41305	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
L41304	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hurry up with those papers.
L41231	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ew. . .  the honest type.
L41230	u3669	m242	DMITRI	"She doesn't want to do anything ""dishonest"". . ."
L41227	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Look!
L41226	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	He's her?
L41225	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's her.
L41213	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
L41212	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What was that?
L41191	u3669	m242	DMITRI	We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
L41190	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
L41624	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Run, Anya -  go...
L41623	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I'll show you!
L41572	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
L41571	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
L41570	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
L41569	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you want?!
L41568	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
L41567	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Rasputin!
L41566	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
L41558	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
L41557	u3669	m242	DMITRI	And tell me that she's happy.
L41556	u3674	m242	TATIANA	She does.
L41555	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Promise me she'll have her home.
L41554	u3674	m242	TATIANA	That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
L41553	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I should go
L41552	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You are the boy ...
L41549	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
L41548	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
L41547	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No. Empress, you --
L41546	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
L41507	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
L41506	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
L41502	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
L41501	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
L41491	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Remove him at once.
L41490	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Please, if you'd just listen...
L41489	u3674	m242	TATIANA	How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
L41488	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
L41074	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
L41073	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I did no such thing!
L41072	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	You gave the orders!
L41071	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I had nothing to do with it!
L41070	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
L41069	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
L41462	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
L41461	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Perhaps you could convince her?
L41460	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
L41459	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
L41458	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
L41457	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
L41449	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
L41448	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
L45646	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
L45645	u3725	m245	Z	This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
L45644	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Break's over.
L45643	u3725	m245	Z	Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
L45642	u3716	m245	AZTECA	No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
L45641	u3725	m245	Z	The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
L45640	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
L45639	u3725	m245	Z	Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
L45972	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Right...because every ant's important!
L45971	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Someone who follows his heart!
L45968	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No -- an <u>individual</u>!
L45967	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Invisible!
L45966	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
L45963	u3716	m245	AZTECA	That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
L45962	u3724	m245	WEAVER	You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
L45875	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
L45874	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
L45862	u3716	m245	AZTECA	I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
L45861	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
L45860	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Are you asking me out to dinner?
L45859	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
L45858	u3716	m245	AZTECA	I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
L45852	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
L45851	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
L45850	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Tell me about it.
L45849	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I'm new...I was born yesterday.
L45848	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
L46149	u3717	m245	BALA	Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
L46148	u3720	m245	FORMICA	You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
L46147	u3717	m245	BALA	Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
L46146	u3720	m245	FORMICA	It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
L46145	u3717	m245	BALA	He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
L45677	u3717	m245	BALA	Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
L45676	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well...  I declared war!
L45675	u3717	m245	BALA	So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
L45672	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
L45671	u3717	m245	BALA	General -- we have to talk sometime!
L46263	u3717	m245	BALA	A <u>few</u>?
L46262	u3725	m245	Z	I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
L46181	u3725	m245	Z	I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
L46180	u3717	m245	BALA	Z!  what are you doing?
L46179	u3717	m245	BALA	Oh no...
L46178	u3725	m245	Z	Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
L46176	u3717	m245	BALA	There's something going on, Z --
L46175	u3725	m245	Z	Why do they have you tied up here?
L46115	u3725	m245	Z	Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
L46114	u3717	m245	BALA	You held onto this all that time?
L46113	u3725	m245	Z	Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
L46112	u3725	m245	Z	"Well, ""trouble"" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night."
L46111	u3717	m245	BALA	Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
L46110	u3725	m245	Z	So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
L46094	u3725	m245	Z	"Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. ""Insectopia""."
L46093	u3717	m245	BALA	Come on, Z.
L46079	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
L46078	u3725	m245	Z	Yes?
L46077	u3717	m245	BALA	Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
L46043	u3725	m245	Z	Let's dig in!
L46042	u3717	m245	BALA	You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
L46041	u3725	m245	Z	We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
L46039	u3717	m245	BALA	What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
L46038	u3725	m245	Z	Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
L46037	u3717	m245	BALA	Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
L46004	u3717	m245	BALA	Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
L46003	u3725	m245	Z	So what makes you so special?
L46002	u3717	m245	BALA	Well...no, but --
L46001	u3725	m245	Z	And only you can become a Queen?
L46000	u3717	m245	BALA	Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
L45999	u3725	m245	Z	Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
L45998	u3717	m245	BALA	General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
L45997	u3725	m245	Z	Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
L45994	u3717	m245	BALA	Stop fooling around in there.
L45993	u3725	m245	Z	Hlllllllp!
L45992	u3717	m245	BALA	Out here I'm just what?
L45991	u3725	m245	Z	"Listen, ""Princess"", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --"
L45990	u3717	m245	BALA	Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
L45989	u3725	m245	Z	This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
L45986	u3717	m245	BALA	Wait, I hear something!
L45985	u3725	m245	Z	Want a list?
L45984	u3717	m245	BALA	Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
L45982	u3725	m245	Z	Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
L45981	u3717	m245	BALA	We're going to die!
L45979	u3725	m245	Z	<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
L45978	u3717	m245	BALA	My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
L45977	u3725	m245	Z	Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
L45976	u3717	m245	BALA	Water...water...
L45958	u3717	m245	BALA	That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
L45957	u3725	m245	Z	I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
L45956	u3717	m245	BALA	Worker!  Come back here now!
L45955	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
L45954	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
L45953	u3725	m245	Z	Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
L45952	u3717	m245	BALA	Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
L45951	u3717	m245	BALA	I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
L45950	u3725	m245	Z	Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
L45949	u3717	m245	BALA	I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
L45948	u3725	m245	Z	Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
L45947	u3717	m245	BALA	Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
L45946	u3725	m245	Z	Well I guess that makes us even.
L45945	u3717	m245	BALA	I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
L45944	u3725	m245	Z	Look around, sweetheart.
L45943	u3717	m245	BALA	"No!  There's no such thing as ""just two ants.""  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!"
L45942	u3725	m245	Z	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
L45941	u3717	m245	BALA	Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
L45940	u3725	m245	Z	Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
L45939	u3717	m245	BALA	How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
L45938	u3725	m245	Z	Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
L45937	u3717	m245	BALA	I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
L45936	u3717	m245	BALA	Climb up that tree and get a better view!
L45935	u3725	m245	Z	Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
L45934	u3725	m245	Z	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
L45933	u3717	m245	BALA	I order you to find out where we are!
L45932	u3725	m245	Z	How should <u>I know</u>?
L45931	u3717	m245	BALA	What <u>was</u> that thing?
L45918	u3717	m245	BALA	SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
L45917	u3725	m245	Z	-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
L45916	u3717	m245	BALA	Quiet -- sshhh!!
L45915	u3725	m245	Z	That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
L45914	u3717	m245	BALA	I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
L45913	u3725	m245	Z	Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
L45912	u3717	m245	BALA	OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
L45911	u3725	m245	Z	No...as a matter of fact...
L45910	u3717	m245	BALA	He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
L45908	u3717	m245	BALA	No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
L45907	u3725	m245	Z	Divinely?
L45906	u3717	m245	BALA	You dance...
L45905	u3725	m245	Z	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
L45904	u3717	m245	BALA	No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
L45898	u3725	m245	Z	Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
L45897	u3717	m245	BALA	Yes.
L45896	u3725	m245	Z	Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
L45895	u3717	m245	BALA	I'm Princess Bala.
L45894	u3725	m245	Z	And you are...?
L45893	u3725	m245	Z	Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
L45892	u3717	m245	BALA	You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
L45761	u3717	m245	BALA	Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
L45760	u3725	m245	Z	Wait!  When can I see you again?
L45759	u3717	m245	BALA	Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
L45750	u3717	m245	BALA	Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
L45749	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
L45748	u3717	m245	BALA	You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
L45746	u3717	m245	BALA	Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
L45745	u3725	m245	Z	You -- you think I'm right?
L45744	u3717	m245	BALA	You're right!
L45743	u3725	m245	Z	Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
L45742	u3717	m245	BALA	Really?
L45741	u3725	m245	Z	Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
L45740	u3717	m245	BALA	Are you sure this is a real dance?
L45737	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>What</u>?
L45736	u3725	m245	Z	The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
L45735	u3717	m245	BALA	I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
L45734	u3725	m245	Z	So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
L45732	u3717	m245	BALA	Wanna dance?
L45731	u3725	m245	Z	What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
L45721	u3717	m245	BALA	Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
L45720	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course not --
L45719	u3717	m245	BALA	And do Princesses do improper things?
L45718	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course --
L45717	u3717	m245	BALA	I'm the Princess, aren't I?
L45716	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
L45693	u3717	m245	BALA	The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
L45692	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
L45691	u3717	m245	BALA	The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
L46192	u3717	m245	BALA	Mom!
L46191	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Bala!
L45794	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
L45793	u3717	m245	BALA	Who is that idiot?
L45684	u3717	m245	BALA	Yes...he's wonderful...
L45683	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
L45682	u3717	m245	BALA	You did?
L45681	u3723	m245	QUEEN	I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
L45667	u3717	m245	BALA	It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
L45666	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
L45847	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
L45846	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
L45845	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	I wonder...what...was it all...for...
L45844	u3725	m245	Z	Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
L45843	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
L45842	u3725	m245	Z	No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
L45841	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
L45840	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus!
L45839	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus?
L45838	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Z!  Over here!
L45826	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't get all sappy about it!
L45825	u3725	m245	Z	BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
L45819	u3725	m245	Z	Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
L45818	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
L45814	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Superior numbers, kid!
L45813	u3725	m245	Z	So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
L45811	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
L45810	u3725	m245	Z	Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
L45805	u3725	m245	Z	Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
L45804	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	No -- we're going to attack the termites!
L45803	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
L45802	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
L45799	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
L45798	u3725	m245	Z	I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
L45797	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	You new, kid?
L46250	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
L46249	u3720	m245	FORMICA	What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
L46035	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Ant Team Six...
L46034	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
L46033	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
L46032	u3720	m245	FORMICA	"What do we have on this ""Insectopia""?"
L46014	u3720	m245	FORMICA	No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
L46013	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
L46012	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
L46008	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
L46007	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
L45679	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Duty calls!
L45678	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
L45674	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Outstanding.  Princess...?
L45673	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
L45664	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
L45663	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
L46027	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No, sir!
L46026	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Not that one.  Or that one.
L46025	u3724	m245	WEAVER	That's correct, sir!
L46024	u3720	m245	FORMICA	We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
L46023	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Okay, son.
L46022	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I...I have no idea, sir.
L46021	u3720	m245	FORMICA	So tell me.  Where's Z?
L46020	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Thank you, sir.
L46019	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Good.  You're a good soldier.
L46018	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Oh, no, sir!
L46017	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
L46016	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
L46015	u3720	m245	FORMICA	So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
L45922	u3725	m245	Z	Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
L45921	u3720	m245	FORMICA	ARREST HIM!
L45920	u3725	m245	Z	Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
L45919	u3720	m245	FORMICA	What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
L45903	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, of course --
L45902	u3720	m245	FORMICA	May I cut in?
L45889	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
L45888	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
L45887	u3725	m245	Z	"Well I, I don't think ""living it up"" is the right term -- how about ""working themselves to death""?"
L45886	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
L45885	u3725	m245	Z	...Not enough food?
L45884	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
L45883	u3725	m245	Z	Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
L45882	u3720	m245	FORMICA	In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
L45881	u3725	m245	Z	So...you two are in love?
L45880	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Affirmative.
L45879	u3725	m245	Z	Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
L45878	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
L45877	u3725	m245	Z	Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
L45876	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
L45873	u3725	m245	Z	ONE TO NOTHING!
L45872	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
L45871	u3725	m245	Z	Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
L45870	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
L45869	u3725	m245	Z	No -- you -- you don't understand!
L45788	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
L45787	u3725	m245	Z	Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
L45786	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
L45785	u3725	m245	Z	Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
L46188	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Alright, let's move out!
L46187	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
L46186	u3720	m245	FORMICA	'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
L46185	u3723	m245	QUEEN	But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
L46184	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
L45901	u3720	m245	FORMICA	They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
L45900	u3723	m245	QUEEN	All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
L45670	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
L45669	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
L45668	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
L45661	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
L45660	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
L45659	u3723	m245	QUEEN	No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
L45658	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
L45657	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes, what else?
L45656	u3720	m245	FORMICA	We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
L45655	u3723	m245	QUEEN	General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
L45635	u3725	m245	Z	But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
L45634	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	"You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, ""Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."""
L45633	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
L45632	u3725	m245	Z	...Ants...
L45631	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	What do you see out there?
L45630	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	I'm glad you asked me that question!
L45629	u3725	m245	Z	Why are we so successful?
L45628	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Ask me why we're so successful.
L45626	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	"YES!!!  You know, people ask me, ""Doctor, why are you always happy?"" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?"
L45625	u3725	m245	Z	...I should?
L45624	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
L45623	u3725	m245	Z	I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
L46222	u3724	m245	WEAVER	You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
L46221	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
L45777	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
L45776	u3725	m245	Z	What do I do?
L45775	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah, I know.
L45774	u3725	m245	Z	You're a real buddy.
L45773	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Wear this.
L45772	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
L45771	u3725	m245	Z	You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
L45770	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
L45769	u3725	m245	Z	Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
L45768	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I can't think of any.
L45767	u3725	m245	Z	You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
L45766	u3725	m245	Z	What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
L45765	u3724	m245	WEAVER	It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
L45764	u3725	m245	Z	Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
L45763	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
L45726	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
L45725	u3725	m245	Z	I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
L45724	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Time to cut a rug, Z!
L45715	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
L45714	u3725	m245	Z	Hey, did you hear what he said?!
L45709	u3725	m245	Z	Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
L45708	u3724	m245	WEAVER	And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
L45707	u3725	m245	Z	Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
L45706	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
L45705	u3725	m245	Z	I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
L45704	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
L45703	u3725	m245	Z	Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
L45702	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
L45701	u3725	m245	Z	Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
L45700	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
L45699	u3725	m245	Z	Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
L45696	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I'll be back.
L45695	u3725	m245	Z	We declared war again?  Are you scared?
L61018	u3824	m253	BIFF	Where's your old man?
L61017	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you want, Biff?
L61016	u3824	m253	BIFF	Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
L61015	u3829	m253	MARTY	The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
L61014	u3824	m253	BIFF	Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
L61013	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you want, Biff?
L61012	u3824	m253	BIFF	Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
L61261	u3825	m253	CLERK	No....
L61260	u3829	m253	MARTY	And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
L61259	u3825	m253	CLERK	Uh, yes, sir...
L61258	u3829	m253	MARTY	This is 1952....?
L61257	u3825	m253	CLERK	I beg your pardon?
L61256	u3829	m253	MARTY	I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
L61255	u3825	m253	CLERK	Yes, sir!
L61254	u3829	m253	MARTY	This... is the number one single?
L60936	u3826	m253	DICK	I don't know. National Cash Register?
L60935	u3829	m253	MARTY	What's N.R.C.?
L60934	u3826	m253	DICK	Third time they've been out there this week.
L60933	u3829	m253	MARTY	Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
L60932	u3826	m253	DICK	Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
L60931	u3829	m253	MARTY	Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
L60930	u3826	m253	DICK	Marty. What's for breakfast?
L60929	u3829	m253	MARTY	Morning Dick.
L61486	u3829	m253	MARTY	You do?
L61485	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I think I know exactly what you mean.
L61483	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
L61482	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
L61478	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
L61477	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
L61476	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
L61475	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
L61429	u3829	m253	MARTY	Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
L61428	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Hi, Marty!
L61370	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
L61369	u3829	m253	MARTY	He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
L61368	u3829	m253	MARTY	But he does! Don't you see?
L61367	u3827	m253	EILEEN	But he didn't ask me.
L61366	u3829	m253	MARTY	George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
L61314	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah. Maybe so.
L61313	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
L61312	u3829	m253	MARTY	What time does school start around here?
L61311	u3829	m253	MARTY	School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
L61310	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Then you'll be going to school here....?
L61307	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
L61306	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
L61305	u3829	m253	MARTY	How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
L61304	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You remember me...?
L61302	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, hi....
L61301	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Hi, Marty.
L61189	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Have we ever met before?
L61188	u3829	m253	MARTY	Huh?
L61185	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Poly-what?
L61184	u3829	m253	MARTY	It's polyester.
L61182	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, thanks...
L61181	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Here's your jacket!
L61167	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Seventeen.
L61166	u3829	m253	MARTY	How old are you?
L61009	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
L61008	u3829	m253	MARTY	Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
L61007	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You mean you're going to stay up all night?
L60991	u3827	m253	EILEEN	That's good.
L60990	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh yeah.
L60989	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Learn anything?
L60988	u3829	m253	MARTY	Fine.
L60987	u3827	m253	EILEEN	How was school today?
L60977	u3829	m253	MARTY	I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
L60976	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
L61402	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
L61401	u3827	m253	EILEEN	How are you?
L61400	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Uh, hi, Eileen.
L61362	u3828	m253	GEORGE	No!
L61361	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
L60999	u3827	m253	EILEEN	George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
L60998	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Eileen, Chinese food again?
L60997	u3827	m253	EILEEN	By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
L60986	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Coming, Eileen...
L60985	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
L61456	u3829	m253	MARTY	No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
L61455	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Maybe if I used my left....
L61452	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
L61451	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
L61450	u3829	m253	MARTY	Your line, George!
L61449	u3829	m253	MARTY	George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
L61448	u3828	m253	GEORGE	You mean, you're gonna --
L61446	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Why is she gonna get angry with you?
L61445	u3829	m253	MARTY	Why what?
L61444	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Why?
L61443	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
L61442	u3828	m253	GEORGE	In the parking lot, with her.
L61441	u3829	m253	MARTY	And where am I gonna be?
L61440	u3828	m253	GEORGE	I'm going to be at the dance.
L61439	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
L61438	u3828	m253	GEORGE	But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
L61437	u3829	m253	MARTY	How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
L61436	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
L61435	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
L61434	u3828	m253	GEORGE	I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
L61395	u3829	m253	MARTY	Bic... It's a Bic pen.
L61394	u3828	m253	GEORGE	'Bike fine point?'
L61393	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Lemme see that.
L61392	u3829	m253	MARTY	It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
L61391	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
L61390	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
L61389	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Huh?
L61388	u3829	m253	MARTY	Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
L61387	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
L61386	u3829	m253	MARTY	Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
L61385	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What do I say?
L61381	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay, then!
L61380	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Well... yeah...
L61379	u3829	m253	MARTY	George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
L61360	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Not now....
L61359	u3829	m253	MARTY	You've gotta ask her to the dance!
L61006	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
L61005	u3828	m253	GEORGE	The sunrise? What for?
L61002	u3829	m253	MARTY	Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
L61001	u3828	m253	GEORGE	No, Chinese food is fine.
L60996	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Good.
L60995	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh yeah.
L60994	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Learn anything?
L60993	u3829	m253	MARTY	Fine..
L60981	u3829	m253	MARTY	The drill!  The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.
L60980	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What drill?
L60979	u3829	m253	MARTY	Dad, you seen the drill?
L61343	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Run out of gas?
L61342	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
L61341	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
L61340	u3829	m253	MARTY	Who, me?
L61320	u3829	m253	MARTY	Marty. Marty Lewis.
L61319	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You have a name?
L61318	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
L61317	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
L60953	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
L60952	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
L60951	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah, explode it up your ass!
L60950	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
L60949	u3829	m253	MARTY	You know damn well that's not what I meant.
L60948	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
L60947	u3829	m253	MARTY	Not a holocaust --
L60946	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
L61153	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Nineteen fifty --
L61152	u3829	m253	MARTY	What year?
L61151	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	March 11th.
L61150	u3829	m253	MARTY	Operator, what's today's date?
L61149	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	I'm sorry, there's no answer.
L61148	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Five cents, please.
L61147	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
L61146	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
L61145	u3829	m253	MARTY	What?
L61144	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Sir, it only costs a nickel.
L61143	u3829	m253	MARTY	Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
L61142	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Operator...
L61106	u3829	m253	MARTY	Pro! Release the rope!
L61105	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	What?!
L61053	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah,  Right.
L61052	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
L61047	u3829	m253	MARTY	Home, school, here... 
L61046	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
L61043	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
L61042	u3829	m253	MARTY	What, am I radioactive or something?
L61039	u3829	m253	MARTY	What's this all about?
L61038	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
L61657	u3829	m253	MARTY	It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
L61656	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Pretty, isn't it?
L61654	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The Orpheum.
L61653	u3829	m253	MARTY	What theater was I at?
L61652	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
L61651	u3829	m253	MARTY	Obviously!  
L61650	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
L61649	u3829	m253	MARTY	But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
L61648	u3829	m253	MARTY	87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
L61647	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
L61644	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A car.
L61643	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you call this? 
L61642	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
L61639	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
L61638	u3829	m253	MARTY	What year is this?
L61571	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
L61570	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
L61566	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
L61565	u3829	m253	MARTY	Thanks for everything, Pro.
L61561	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
L61560	u3829	m253	MARTY	It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
L61542	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Curious...  Very curious.
L61541	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
L61540	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You didn't?
L61472	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
L61471	u3829	m253	MARTY	Perfect...
L61470	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	There's no way of knowing.
L61469	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
L61468	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
L61467	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's just what I needed to hear.
L61466	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
L61465	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
L61464	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
L61463	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
L61462	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
L61461	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's all taken care of.
L61425	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jesus!
L61424	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
L61423	u3829	m253	MARTY	Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
L61422	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
L61421	u3829	m253	MARTY	But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
L61420	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	My guess is that she turned him down.
L61419	u3829	m253	MARTY	But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
L61418	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
L61414	u3829	m253	MARTY	Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
L61413	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
L61412	u3829	m253	MARTY	I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
L61411	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Where did you get this?
L61376	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
L61375	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
L61372	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You did what?!?
L61371	u3829	m253	MARTY	I know.
L61298	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Curious... Very curious....
L61297	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, it was there.
L61296	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I don't recall ever seeing it before.
L61295	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
L61294	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Say, where did this guitar come from?
L61291	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
L61290	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
L61289	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
L61288	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, be serious, would you?
L61287	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	An atomic bomb.
L61250	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
L61249	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
L61247	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
L61246	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
L61245	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
L61244	u3829	m253	MARTY	What if you lost your keys?
L61243	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
L61242	u3829	m253	MARTY	You were ringing the doorbell!
L61241	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You answered the door!
L61232	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's just great!
L61231	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
L61222	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	We don't....
L61221	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
L61219	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
L61218	u3829	m253	MARTY	How did you know?
L61215	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
L61214	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
L61213	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
L61212	u3829	m253	MARTY	The power converter...
L61211	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
L61205	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
L61204	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Pardon me?
L61202	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
L61201	u3829	m253	MARTY	You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
L61200	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
L61196	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
L61195	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A mall?
L61194	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
L61193	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, yeah.
L61192	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
L61191	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
L61175	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
L61174	u3829	m253	MARTY	Marty.
L61173	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
L61171	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Ssshhhhh!
L61170	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
L61169	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You know me?
L61168	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor? Professor Brown?
L61092	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure, he agreed quickly.
L61091	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
L61090	u3829	m253	MARTY	All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
L61089	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
L61088	u3829	m253	MARTY	So what? We'd be rich!
L61087	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Marty, that would alter history.
L61085	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
L61084	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A gold mine?
L61081	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
L61080	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
L61079	u3829	m253	MARTY	Is Shemp all right?
L61078	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
L61073	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Why?
L61072	u3829	m253	MARTY	The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
L61068	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Precisely! 
L61067	u3829	m253	MARTY	A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
L61064	u3829	m253	MARTY	Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
L61063	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
L61062	u3829	m253	MARTY	The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
L61061	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
L61060	u3829	m253	MARTY	Then where the hell is he?
L61059	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
L61057	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
L61056	u3829	m253	MARTY	But Professor --
L60928	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	...To be traveled through
L60927	u3829	m253	MARTY	Catch you later! 
L60925	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
L60924	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Oh, right, right... 
L60923	u3829	m253	MARTY	Pro, the sun's out!
L60922	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	AM or PM?
L60921	u3829	m253	MARTY	Eight thirty.
L60920	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
L60919	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
L60918	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
L60915	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
L60914	u3829	m253	MARTY	That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
L60913	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
L60911	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Shhhhhhhh!
L60910	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
L61127	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
L61126	u3829	m253	MARTY	What happened to Dick Wilson?
L61125	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	I run this place! 
L61124	u3829	m253	MARTY	Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
L61123	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Dick? Dick who?
L61122	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
L61120	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure,.
L61119	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
L61114	u3829	m253	MARTY	A Tab.
L61113	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	What? 
L61112	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
L61682	u3834	m253	SUZY	What did you do to yours?
L61681	u3829	m253	MARTY	What did you do to your hair?
L61680	u3834	m253	SUZY	Hi, Marty!
L61679	u3829	m253	MARTY	Suzy!
L61032	u3834	m253	SUZY	Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
L61031	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
L61030	u3834	m253	SUZY	Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
L61029	u3829	m253	MARTY	No way!
L61028	u3834	m253	SUZY	Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
L61027	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
L61026	u3834	m253	SUZY	No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
L61025	u3829	m253	MARTY	...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
L64058	u3848	m255	BILLY	Then that's it!
L64057	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	"Halloween. 1938...""War of the Worlds""...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax."
L64056	u3848	m255	BILLY	You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
L64055	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
L64052	u3848	m255	BILLY	Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
L64051	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	New Jersey?
L64050	u3848	m255	BILLY	All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
L64022	u3848	m255	BILLY	Who're you?
L64021	u3856	m255	NEW JERSEY	So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
L64182	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	They're stealing my chopper!
L64181	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	There's another one we owe 'em.
L64108	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
L64107	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	Not me. No way.
L64106	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You wanna take the chance, Casper?
L64105	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
L64032	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
L64031	u3851	m255	CASPER LINDLEY	Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
L63991	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
L63990	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Planet 10?
L63989	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
L63988	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
L63987	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
L63986	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	It's your hand, Buckaroo.
L63985	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
L63983	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
L63982	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	What?
L63981	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
L63980	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
L63892	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
L63891	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
L63882	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
L63881	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
L63773	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
L63772	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
L63746	u3860	m255	PROF. HIKITA	The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
L63745	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
L64180	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
L64179	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	We will, old fried, we will.
L64173	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	So I was right.  That's nice to know...
L64172	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Arachtoid.
L64171	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Apache?
L64170	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Just 'grazed' you, huh?
L64169	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	You're a welcome sight...
L64162	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
L64161	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You okay?
L63950	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
L63949	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
L63948	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	What crate?
L63947	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	The deuce you say.  That crate!
L63946	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
L63945	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
L63911	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
L63910	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
L63834	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
L63833	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
L63832	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
L63830	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	First thing I did.
L63829	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Have you warned Professor Hikita?
L63828	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
L63824	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Vanished. Thin air.
L63823	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Then what?
L63771	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Same one you had yesterday?
L63770	u3861	m255	RAWHIDE	Got a half a tuna sandwich.
L63769	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm starving...somebody, help.
L64416	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
L64415	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
L64235	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
L64234	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
L64154	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Where's the professor?
L64153	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Dead.  Damnit!
L64148	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
L64147	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	What is it, Tommy?
L64146	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Buckaroo--! Sorry--
L64089	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	It?  Who does?
L64088	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
L64081	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
L64080	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
L63879	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Let her out?  She's a killer.
L63878	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Let her out. In my custody.
L63877	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Running a little late, Buckaroo.
L63836	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
L63835	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
L63790	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
L63789	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
L63786	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	She wants a picture.
L63785	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Not really.  This is pretty important.
L63784	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
L63778	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
L63777	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Anybody we know?
L64410	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Now!
L64409	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
L64408	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
L64403	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
L64402	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
L64398	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
L64397	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
L64382	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	The door's locked.
L64381	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	We're going down!  Onto the runway!
L64372	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
L64371	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	What is this thing?  A fighter?
L64246	u3854	m255	JOHN PARKER	They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
L64245	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
L64419	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
L64418	u3862	m255	RENO	Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
L64417	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Got a casualty list?
L64232	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
L64231	u3862	m255	RENO	They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
L64184	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Don't shoot!
L64183	u3862	m255	RENO	And they got Penny!  Look!
L64111	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	To get my guns.
L64110	u3862	m255	RENO	Where're you goin'?
L64087	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
L64086	u3862	m255	RENO	...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
L64083	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
L64082	u3862	m255	RENO	...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
L64078	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	What? How do you know that?
L64077	u3862	m255	RENO	They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
L63775	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
L63774	u3862	m255	RENO	And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
L64240	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Penny--?!  Are you all right?
L64239	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
L64150	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
L64149	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Stay here, I'll be back.
L64145	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
L64144	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	It's too dangerous.
L64143	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
L64142	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Absolutely.
L64141	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Believe in Penny Priddy?
L64140	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
L64139	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
L64138	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
L64137	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Go where?  Where're you going?
L64136	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
L64135	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
L64134	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Never.
L64132	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I wish he was.  He's real enough.
L64131	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
L64130	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
L64129	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
L64128	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You don't wanna know.
L64127	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	How did she die?  I wanna know.
L64126	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
L64125	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
L64124	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
L64123	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Oh, my.
L64122	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was killed, Penny.
L64121	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
L64114	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
L64113	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Open up or I'll shoot it off.
L63904	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Any time.
L63903	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	You keep an eye on it.
L63876	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
L63875	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
L63874	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
L63873	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
L63872	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Another 'you'?
L63871	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
L63870	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
L63869	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Which?  The one in my throat.
L63868	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
L63867	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	No, I don't.
L63866	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
L63865	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
L63864	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
L63863	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
L63862	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	It's kinda hard this way.
L63861	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
L63860	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	The girl I remind you of.
L63859	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who?
L63858	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Was she pretty?
L63857	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Pretty terrible shot.
L63856	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	You.  Like the papers all say.
L63855	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who were you really trying to kill last night?
L63854	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Go away.  Let me rot?
L63853	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
L63852	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
L63810	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Everybody okay up here?
L63809	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
L63808	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
L63807	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
L63805	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
L63804	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	He offered you money?
L63803	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
L63802	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
L63801	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
L63800	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	"Did you say...""Peggy""?"
L63799	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
L63798	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
L63797	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	This is so embarrassing...
L63796	u3849	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI	Raise your hand...where?
L64216	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
L64215	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
L64214	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	A what?
L64213	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
L64198	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
L64197	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
L64196	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
L64195	u3850	m255	BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
L64194	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
L64359	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	Damn John Whorfin--!
L64358	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	But John Whorfin said kill her.
L64072	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	You look!  It's not here!
L64071	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	John Whorfin will kill us!
L64070	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	Not here!  No Overthruster!
L63940	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	I have a radio fix...
L63939	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
L63935	u3852	m255	JOHN BIGBOOT	A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
L63934	u3853	m255	JOHN O'CONNOR	What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
L64256	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Should we be on Code Red?
L64255	u3855	m255	NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
L64254	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
L64253	u3855	m255	NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
L64252	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	What's happening with my call to SAC?
L64251	u3855	m255	NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	No, sir.  I think the flint...
L64250	u3859	m255	PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
L64008	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Better than him.
L64007	u3862	m255	RENO	Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
L64006	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What's his problem?
L63956	u3862	m255	RENO	Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
L63955	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
L63954	u3862	m255	RENO	Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
L63953	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
L63952	u3862	m255	RENO	Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
L63951	u3857	m255	PENNY PRIDDY	How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
L64275	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Asshole probably got lost.
L64274	u3862	m255	RENO	We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
L63928	u3862	m255	RENO	No!  Ditto the professor-
L63927	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Any sign of Buckaroo?
L63850	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
L63849	u3862	m255	RENO	Why me?
L63848	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
L63844	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Where do you hail from, Doc?
L63843	u3862	m255	RENO	The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
L63827	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
L63826	u3862	m255	RENO	You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
L63825	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
L63821	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
L63820	u3862	m255	RENO	Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
L63819	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Pictures don't lie.
L63818	u3862	m255	RENO	Doesn't look anything like her to me.
L63817	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	It's a spittin' image.
L63816	u3862	m255	RENO	I didn't drop 'em.
L63815	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Pick those up, Reno.
L63680	u3862	m255	RENO	Why me?
L63679	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
L63719	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
L63718	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
L63693	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Bet I do.
L63692	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
L63691	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
L63690	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	Flying to Cambodia.
L63689	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
L63688	u3858	m255	PERFECT TOMMY	Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
L63687	u3863	m255	TV ANCHORWOMAN	So where's Buckaroo?
L73169	u3920	m260	BARBARA	The boys need help.
L73168	u3919	m260	ALFRED	In spirit only, I'm afraid.
L73167	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Uncle Alfred?
L73103	u3919	m260	ALFRED	It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
L73102	u3920	m260	BARBARA	What is it?
L73101	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
L73099	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
L73098	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
L73097	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Too late for what, dear child?
L73096	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm sorry.  I was too late.
L72785	u3919	m260	ALFRED	As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
L72784	u3920	m260	BARBARA	It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
L72783	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
L72782	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
L72781	u3919	m260	ALFRED	You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
L72780	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
L72765	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Oh no, those things frighten me.
L72764	u3919	m260	ALFRED	You certainly will not.
L72753	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Eventually she married a young physician.
L72752	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
L72751	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
L72748	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
L72747	u3920	m260	BARBARA	How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
L73298	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
L73297	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, are you...?
L73147	u3919	m260	ALFRED	It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
L73146	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What is it?
L73143	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
L73142	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
L73141	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Pheromones?
L73140	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
L73138	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Coming on line now, sir.
L73137	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
L73136	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Specify, please.
L73135	u3923	m260	BRUCE	First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
L73134	u3919	m260	ALFRED	That, sir, does not compute.
L73133	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Women.
L73132	u3919	m260	ALFRED	What seems to be the problem?
L73131	u3923	m260	BRUCE	It's good to see you.
L73129	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Right here, sir.
L73128	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
L73083	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
L73082	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I love you, old man.
L73081	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
L73080	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
L73005	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Yes?
L73004	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
L73003	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Not all heroes wear masks.
L73002	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
L73001	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
L73000	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
L72999	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
L72998	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I am as well as can be expected.
L72899	u3919	m260	ALFRED	No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
L72898	u3923	m260	BRUCE	But I can't can I?
L72897	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
L72896	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
L72895	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Is there something wrong, sir?
L72894	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Thanks.
L72893	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
L72771	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
L72770	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
L72767	u3919	m260	ALFRED	There's a lovely inn just down --
L72766	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
L72757	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
L72756	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You have?
L72740	u3923	m260	BRUCE	No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
L72739	u3919	m260	ALFRED	I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
L72697	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
L72696	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
L72695	u3919	m260	ALFRED	Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
L72694	u3923	m260	BRUCE	He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
L73303	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You are going back to school.
L73302	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
L73301	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
L72761	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I recognized the accent.
L72760	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
L72759	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Oxbridge Academy?
L72758	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm on break from-
L72963	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
L72962	u3924	m260	DICK	Alfred's happy here.
L72961	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
L72960	u3924	m260	DICK	Alfred and Bruce are like family.
L72959	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
L72958	u3924	m260	DICK	What are you talking about?
L72957	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
L72956	u3924	m260	DICK	Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
L72955	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
L72954	u3924	m260	DICK	You'd be surprised.
L72953	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
L72951	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
L72950	u3924	m260	DICK	Hey, what's your problem?
L72949	u3920	m260	BARBARA	Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
L72948	u3924	m260	DICK	Keep it.
L72947	u3920	m260	BARBARA	This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
L72946	u3924	m260	DICK	Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
L72945	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
L72755	u3920	m260	BARBARA	My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
L72754	u3924	m260	DICK	Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
L72743	u3920	m260	BARBARA	I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
L72742	u3924	m260	DICK	Please be looking for me.
L73250	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
L73249	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Damn?  Damn is not good.
L73248	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
L73237	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	I don't know.  It just feels right.
L73236	u3930	m260	ROBIN	What exactly are you doing?
L73235	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Pow!  What!  Kazow!
L73234	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Be ready for anything.
L73233	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	I'm afraid to ask.
L73232	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Crimefighter's rule number two.
L73228	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Why?
L73227	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
L73226	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	This is easy.
L73223	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
L73222	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
L73215	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Divide and conquer.
L73214	u3921	m260	BATGIRL	Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
L73285	u3922	m260	BATMAN	I didn't kill your wife.
L73284	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
L73269	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
L73268	u3922	m260	BATMAN	You're loosing your cool
L73225	u3922	m260	BATMAN	We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
L73224	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
L72627	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
L72626	u3925	m260	FREEZE	After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
L72623	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I hate being lectured.
L72622	u3922	m260	BATMAN	You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
L73278	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
L73277	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Winded, old timer?
L73247	u3930	m260	ROBIN	From the other side of the equator-
L73246	u3922	m260	BATMAN	If we could relay the sunlight-
L73239	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Maybe he melted.
L73238	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No sign of the snowman.
L73206	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
L73205	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I guess we'll just have to kill her.
L73204	u3922	m260	BATMAN	She knows who we are.
L73203	u3930	m260	ROBIN	We gotta get those locks changed.
L73055	u3930	m260	ROBIN	A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
L73054	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
L73053	u3930	m260	ROBIN	What are you talking about?
L73052	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
L73031	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Just the beast.
L73030	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No beauty...
L73029	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
L73028	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Can he save her?
L73027	u3922	m260	BATMAN	She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
L73026	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Open Sesame...Chicken.
L73025	u3930	m260	ROBIN	How did you...?
L73024	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Definitely.
L73023	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Umm-hmmmm.
L73022	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Me too.  Great stems, though.
L73021	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I'm totally over her.  Positively.
L73020	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
L73019	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
L73018	u3922	m260	BATMAN	I know.  The feeling just vanished.
L73017	u3930	m260	ROBIN	She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
L72878	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I can make it.
L72877	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
L72857	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
L72856	u3922	m260	BATMAN	You don't have two million.  Three million - -
L72834	u3922	m260	BATMAN	He'll be here.
L72833	u3930	m260	ROBIN	You think Freeze will take the bait?
L72637	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Surf's up.
L72636	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Watch the first step.
L72631	u3930	m260	ROBIN	How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
L72630	u3922	m260	BATMAN	I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
L72629	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I was just hanging around.
L72594	u3922	m260	BATMAN	No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
L72593	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
L72592	u3922	m260	BATMAN	The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
L72591	u3930	m260	ROBIN	The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
L72590	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Mr. Freeze.
L72589	u3930	m260	ROBIN	... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
L72584	u3930	m260	ROBIN	It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
L72583	u3922	m260	BATMAN	This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
L72582	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
L72581	u3922	m260	BATMAN	Nice suit.  And today you are?
L73120	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
L73119	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
L73118	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
L72827	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
L72826	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
L72820	u3923	m260	BRUCE	People come first, Dr. Isley.
L72819	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
L72818	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
L72817	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
L72816	u3929	m260	PAMELA	I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
L72815	u3923	m260	BRUCE	That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
L72814	u3929	m260	PAMELA	I see you knew him.
L72813	u3923	m260	BRUCE	We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
L72812	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
L72811	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
L72810	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Dr. Pamela Isley.
L72809	u3923	m260	BRUCE	They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
L73117	u3927	m260	JULIE	You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
L73116	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Well...um...her.
L73115	u3927	m260	JULIE	Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
L73111	u3927	m260	JULIE	Bruce?  What are you doing?
L73110	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
L72932	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I wish I knew.
L72931	u3927	m260	JULIE	You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
L72930	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What?
L72929	u3927	m260	JULIE	Who's Ivy?
L72928	u3927	m260	JULIE	I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
L72927	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I wouldn't bet on that.
L72926	u3927	m260	JULIE	But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
L72925	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
L72924	u3927	m260	JULIE	I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
L72923	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
L72922	u3927	m260	JULIE	We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
L72921	u3923	m260	BRUCE	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
L72920	u3927	m260	JULIE	You're not even listening to me.
L72803	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Can I get some help over here?
L72802	u3927	m260	JULIE	And?
L72799	u3927	m260	JULIE	But soon...
L72798	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
L72797	u3927	m260	JULIE	No!?
L73300	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I knew you could handle it.
L73299	u3924	m260	DICK	One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
L73159	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
L73158	u3924	m260	DICK	You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
L73157	u3923	m260	BRUCE	She wants to kill you.
L73156	u3924	m260	DICK	Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
L73155	u3923	m260	BRUCE	She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
L73154	u3924	m260	DICK	And she did it all for me.  For love.
L73153	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
L73152	u3924	m260	DICK	That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
L73094	u3924	m260	DICK	Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
L73093	u3923	m260	BRUCE	She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
L73092	u3924	m260	DICK	Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
L73091	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
L73090	u3924	m260	DICK	Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
L73089	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Dick, don't push me right now.
L73088	u3924	m260	DICK	Like hell you do.
L73087	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
L73086	u3924	m260	DICK	I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
L73085	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
L73084	u3924	m260	DICK	McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
L72970	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
L72969	u3924	m260	DICK	Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
L72968	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
L72967	u3924	m260	DICK	But he's never said a word-
L72966	u3923	m260	BRUCE	He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
L72750	u3924	m260	DICK	Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
L72749	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
L72733	u3923	m260	BRUCE	You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
L72732	u3924	m260	DICK	I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
L72691	u3924	m260	DICK	I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
L72690	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
L72689	u3924	m260	DICK	Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
L72688	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
L72687	u3924	m260	DICK	We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
L72686	u3923	m260	BRUCE	I need the Wayne Diamonds.
L72683	u3924	m260	DICK	Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
L72682	u3923	m260	BRUCE	He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
L72681	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Presumed dead.  No one knows.
L72680	u3924	m260	DICK	What happened to his wife?
L72679	u3923	m260	BRUCE	Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
L72678	u3924	m260	DICK	That's gotta hurt.
L73296	u3926	m260	IVY	Not good.
L73295	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
L73078	u3926	m260	IVY	I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
L73077	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
L73076	u3926	m260	IVY	The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
L73075	u3925	m260	FREEZE	One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
L73074	u3926	m260	IVY	As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
L73073	u3925	m260	FREEZE	That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
L73072	u3926	m260	IVY	Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
L73071	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
L73070	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Adam and Evil.
L73069	u3926	m260	IVY	I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
L73068	u3926	m260	IVY	Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
L73067	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
L73066	u3926	m260	IVY	Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
L73065	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
L73063	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You lie!
L73062	u3926	m260	IVY	There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
L73061	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Where is my wife?
L73060	u3926	m260	IVY	Make yourself right at home.
L73015	u3926	m260	IVY	OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
L73014	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You will rescue my wife
L73013	u3926	m260	IVY	Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
L73012	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
L73011	u3926	m260	IVY	Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
L73010	u3926	m260	IVY	You leave Batman and Robin to me.
L73009	u3925	m260	FREEZE	In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
L73008	u3926	m260	IVY	You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
L73007	u3925	m260	FREEZE	My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
L72993	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Dear daisy, don't despair.
L72992	u3926	m260	IVY	I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
L72991	u3925	m260	FREEZE	No gun.  How disarming.
L72988	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
L72987	u3926	m260	IVY	I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
L72985	u3926	m260	IVY	Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
L72984	u3925	m260	FREEZE	An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
L72983	u3926	m260	IVY	Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
L72982	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Impressive
L72868	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
L72867	u3926	m260	IVY	Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
L72866	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
L72718	u3925	m260	FREEZE	Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
L72717	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
L72716	u3925	m260	FREEZE	You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
L72715	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	What say we turn up the heat?
L72714	u3925	m260	FREEZE	To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
L72713	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
L72712	u3925	m260	FREEZE	I find that unlikely.
L72711	u3928	m260	MS. B. HAVEN	Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
L73191	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
L73190	u3926	m260	IVY	You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
L73188	u3926	m260	IVY	Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
L73187	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Then you never loved me?
L73186	u3926	m260	IVY	You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
L73185	u3930	m260	ROBIN	What do you mean?
L73184	u3926	m260	IVY	Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
L73183	u3926	m260	IVY	One kiss, my love.  For luck.
L73182	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I've got to stop him.
L73181	u3926	m260	IVY	Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
L73180	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Tell me and I'll kiss you.
L73179	u3926	m260	IVY	Kiss me and I'll tell you.
L73178	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Of trust. Tell me your plan.
L73177	u3926	m260	IVY	How about dangerous curves?
L73176	u3930	m260	ROBIN	I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
L73175	u3926	m260	IVY	I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
L73039	u3926	m260	IVY	At you?  Polly want a kiss?
L73038	u3930	m260	ROBIN	Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
L72706	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
L72705	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
L72671	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	Well, I can respect your opinion.
L72670	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
L72669	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
L72668	u3929	m260	PAMELA	Our work?
L72667	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
L72655	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
L72654	u3929	m260	PAMELA	You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
L72651	u3929	m260	PAMELA	What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
L72650	u3931	m260	WOODRUE	What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
L74500	u3952	m262	KNOX	Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
L74499	u3942	m262	ALFRED	Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
L74498	u3952	m262	KNOX	Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
L74497	u3942	m262	ALFRED	Yes?
L74133	u3952	m262	KNOX	The small one.
L74132	u3942	m262	ALFRED	Which bathroom is that, sir?
L74131	u3952	m262	KNOX	You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
L74130	u3942	m262	ALFRED	I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
L74129	u3952	m262	KNOX	How high up would you say that is?
L74611	u3944	m262	BRUCE	If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
L74610	u3942	m262	ALFRED	Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
L74609	u3944	m262	BRUCE	How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
L74608	u3942	m262	ALFRED	Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
L74607	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
L74606	u3942	m262	ALFRED	Upstairs. He's quite docile.
L74605	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Where's the boy?
L74595	u3942	m262	ALFRED	... Very good, sir.
L74594	u3944	m262	BRUCE	It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
L74167	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
L74166	u3942	m262	ALFRED	Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
L74654	u3951	m262	JOKER	Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
L74653	u3943	m262	BATMAN	... Murderer...
L74652	u3951	m262	JOKER	You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
L74572	u3951	m262	JOKER	Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
L74571	u3943	m262	BATMAN	What are you talking about?
L74570	u3951	m262	JOKER	Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
L74569	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Take me. Let the boy go.
L74568	u3951	m262	JOKER	Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
L74448	u3943	m262	BATMAN	I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
L74447	u3956	m262	VICKI	You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
L74446	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Is this what you wanted?
L74444	u3956	m262	VICKI	If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
L74443	u3943	m262	BATMAN	I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
L74442	u3956	m262	VICKI	I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
L74441	u3943	m262	BATMAN	No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
L74440	u3956	m262	VICKI	That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
L74439	u3943	m262	BATMAN	They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
L74438	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
L74437	u3956	m262	VICKI	What is that?
L74436	u3943	m262	BATMAN	So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
L74435	u3956	m262	VICKI	I loathe bats.
L74434	u3943	m262	BATMAN	They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
L74433	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
L74432	u3956	m262	VICKI	How'd you find this place?
L74431	u3943	m262	BATMAN	That's why I wear a target on my chest.
L74430	u3956	m262	VICKI	It doesn't protect your head, though.
L74429	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Better. It's not on the market yet.
L74428	u3956	m262	VICKI	What is this stuff? Kevlar?
L74424	u3956	m262	VICKI	Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
L74423	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
L74422	u3956	m262	VICKI	... How long have I been out?
L74415	u3956	m262	VICKI	... Where are you taking me?
L74414	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Thank you, Vicki.
L74413	u3943	m262	BATMAN	I'll take you with me.
L74412	u3956	m262	VICKI	How do I know you won't keep them all?
L74411	u3943	m262	BATMAN	All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
L74410	u3956	m262	VICKI	Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
L74409	u3943	m262	BATMAN	The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
L74407	u3956	m262	VICKI	I won't let you have it.
L74406	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Please.
L74405	u3956	m262	VICKI	I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
L74404	u3943	m262	BATMAN	I'll have to ask you for that film.
L74402	u3956	m262	VICKI	Well -- I think you might consider
L74401	u3943	m262	BATMAN	...Not even a 'thank you'?
L74384	u3956	m262	VICKI	... A hundred and eight?
L74383	u3943	m262	BATMAN	How much do you weigh?
L74377	u3943	m262	BATMAN	Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
L74376	u3956	m262	VICKI	Can't we --
L74375	u3943	m262	BATMAN	He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
L74374	u3956	m262	VICKI	What about the girl?
L74372	u3956	m262	VICKI	Shouldn't we --
L74371	u3943	m262	BATMAN	I know. I called them.
L74370	u3956	m262	VICKI	Look! Police!
L74365	u3956	m262	VICKI	WHICH CAR?
L74364	u3943	m262	BATMAN	GET IN THE CAR!!
L74512	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
L74511	u3952	m262	KNOX	Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
L74510	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Do you want a drink?
L74508	u3952	m262	KNOX	Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
L74507	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
L74506	u3952	m262	KNOX	See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
L74505	u3952	m262	KNOX	Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
L74504	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
L74503	u3952	m262	KNOX	I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
L74502	u3944	m262	BRUCE	What is it you want?
L74501	u3952	m262	KNOX	That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
L74158	u3944	m262	BRUCE	You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
L74157	u3952	m262	KNOX	This is Miss Vale. -- That felt redundant.
L74156	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
L74155	u3952	m262	KNOX	Great.  Give me a grant.
L74154	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
L74153	u3952	m262	KNOX	I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
L74667	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
L74666	u3956	m262	VICKI	I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
L74665	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
L74664	u3956	m262	VICKI	I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
L74603	u3944	m262	BRUCE	In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
L74602	u3956	m262	VICKI	I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
L74601	u3944	m262	BRUCE	All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
L74544	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Hang on. I have to leave a message.
L74543	u3956	m262	VICKI	What now?
L74542	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Got it!
L74541	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
L74540	u3956	m262	VICKI	How can you do that if she's already off the line?
L74539	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Finding out where she is.
L74538	u3956	m262	VICKI	I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
L74537	u3956	m262	VICKI	... Where are you calling from?
L74536	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Keep her on the line!
L74534	u3944	m262	BRUCE	The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
L74533	u3956	m262	VICKI	It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up.
L74530	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I feel naked without it.
L74529	u3956	m262	VICKI	Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
L74528	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
L74527	u3956	m262	VICKI	It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
L74520	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
L74519	u3956	m262	VICKI	Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
L74518	u3944	m262	BRUCE	What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
L74517	u3956	m262	VICKI	You're one man. You can't save everybody.
L74516	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
L74515	u3956	m262	VICKI	I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
L74514	u3944	m262	BRUCE	No one would miss me.
L74513	u3956	m262	VICKI	So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
L74477	u3956	m262	VICKI	I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
L74476	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
L74475	u3956	m262	VICKI	... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
L74474	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
L74459	u3956	m262	VICKI	I wish you'd...
L74458	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
L74457	u3956	m262	VICKI	Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
L74456	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
L74455	u3956	m262	VICKI	Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
L74454	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
L74283	u3944	m262	BRUCE	... Looks like a convention.
L74282	u3956	m262	VICKI	All street mimes should be executed.
L74279	u3956	m262	VICKI	Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
L74278	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
L74277	u3956	m262	VICKI	To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
L74257	u3956	m262	VICKI	Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
L74256	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I don't sing very well.
L74238	u3956	m262	VICKI	... We could try that.
L74237	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Maybe we should just kiss.
L74236	u3956	m262	VICKI	God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
L74235	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I'll take you home if you'd like.
L74234	u3956	m262	VICKI	But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
L74233	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
L74232	u3956	m262	VICKI	I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
L74231	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
L74230	u3956	m262	VICKI	As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
L74229	u3944	m262	BRUCE	In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
L74228	u3956	m262	VICKI	Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
L74226	u3956	m262	VICKI	Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
L74225	u3944	m262	BRUCE	There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
L74224	u3956	m262	VICKI	... Terror.
L74223	u3944	m262	BRUCE	What did you see?
L74222	u3956	m262	VICKI	Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
L74221	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Odd desire for anyone.
L74220	u3956	m262	VICKI	Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
L74219	u3944	m262	BRUCE	No.
L74218	u3956	m262	VICKI	That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
L74217	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
L74215	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
L74214	u3956	m262	VICKI	Do you sail?
L74165	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
L74164	u3956	m262	VICKI	As far as I know.
L74163	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
L74585	u3945	m262	DENT	I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
L74584	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
L74583	u3945	m262	DENT	We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
L74582	u3944	m262	BRUCE	Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
L74581	u3945	m262	DENT	Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
L74580	u3944	m262	BRUCE	I suggest a nice big bomb.
L74579	u3945	m262	DENT	All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
L74578	u3944	m262	BRUCE	He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
L74577	u3945	m262	DENT	We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
L74557	u3946	m262	DRIVER	It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
L74556	u3951	m262	JOKER	MOVE! Can't you do something??
L74555	u3951	m262	JOKER	They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
L74554	u3946	m262	DRIVER	Boss! Jesus! They've --
L74553	u3946	m262	DRIVER	WHAT??
L74552	u3951	m262	JOKER	SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
L74551	u3946	m262	DRIVER	WHAT?
L74550	u3951	m262	JOKER	SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
L74382	u3951	m262	JOKER	Take 'em! I want his head!
L74381	u3946	m262	DRIVER	We got 'em!
L74093	u3947	m262	ECKHARDT	About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
L74092	u3950	m262	JACK	What are you talking about?
L74091	u3947	m262	ECKHARDT	Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
L74090	u3950	m262	JACK	Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
L74089	u3947	m262	ECKHARDT	I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
L74088	u3950	m262	JACK	Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
L74087	u3947	m262	ECKHARDT	I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
L74086	u3950	m262	JACK	Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
L74085	u3947	m262	ECKHARDT	Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
L74084	u3950	m262	JACK	I missed you, Lieutenant.
L74058	u3954	m262	NICK	Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
L74057	u3948	m262	EDDIE	You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
L74056	u3954	m262	NICK	No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
L74055	u3948	m262	EDDIE	My brother's a priest, man.
L74054	u3954	m262	NICK	God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
L74053	u3948	m262	EDDIE	There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
L74052	u3954	m262	NICK	No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
L74051	u3948	m262	EDDIE	Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
L74050	u3954	m262	NICK	Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
L74049	u3948	m262	EDDIE	That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
L74048	u3954	m262	NICK	Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
L74047	u3948	m262	EDDIE	I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
L74046	u3954	m262	NICK	What are you, scared of heights?
L74045	u3948	m262	EDDIE	Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
L74253	u3950	m262	JACK	HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
L74252	u3949	m262	GRISSOM	Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
L74251	u3950	m262	JACK	JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
L74250	u3949	m262	GRISSOM	Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
L74249	u3950	m262	JACK	I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
L74248	u3949	m262	GRISSOM	It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
L74246	u3950	m262	JACK	"Is that what you ""heard""?"
L74245	u3949	m262	GRISSOM	Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
L74244	u3950	m262	JACK	"It's me.  ""Sugar Bumps."""
L74128	u3949	m262	GRISSOM	Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
L74127	u3950	m262	JACK	I understand.
L74126	u3949	m262	GRISSOM	Because I want someone I can trust.
L74125	u3950	m262	JACK	Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
L74122	u3949	m262	GRISSOM	Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
L74121	u3950	m262	JACK	"Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... ""Industrial espionage."""
L74274	u3951	m262	JOKER	That's it.
L74273	u3955	m262	ROTELLI	That's it?
L74272	u3951	m262	JOKER	Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
L74271	u3955	m262	ROTELLI	And what happens if we say no?
L74270	u3951	m262	JOKER	I've considered that possibility.
L74269	u3955	m262	ROTELLI	I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
L74495	u3951	m262	JOKER	Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
L74494	u3953	m262	MAYOR	Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
L74493	u3951	m262	JOKER	Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
L74492	u3953	m262	MAYOR	All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
L74490	u3951	m262	JOKER	Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
L74489	u3953	m262	MAYOR	I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
L74488	u3951	m262	JOKER	Joker here. Can we talk?
L74359	u3951	m262	JOKER	Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
L74358	u3956	m262	VICKI	I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
L74357	u3951	m262	JOKER	What?  I improved her a little...
L74356	u3956	m262	VICKI	You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
L74355	u3951	m262	JOKER	Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
L74354	u3956	m262	VICKI	... Why the mask?
L74349	u3951	m262	JOKER	Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
L74348	u3956	m262	VICKI	I've seen worse.  Much worse.
L74347	u3951	m262	JOKER	... Behind the makeup?
L74346	u3956	m262	VICKI	Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
L74345	u3951	m262	JOKER	A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
L74344	u3956	m262	VICKI	And you want a --
L74343	u3951	m262	JOKER	Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
L74342	u3956	m262	VICKI	... Thank you.
L74636	u3952	m262	KNOX	Holy shit. Holy...
L74635	u3956	m262	VICKI	God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
L74634	u3952	m262	KNOX	Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
L74633	u3956	m262	VICKI	You okay?
L74632	u3952	m262	KNOX	HOLY SHIT!!
L74626	u3952	m262	KNOX	Great. How??
L74625	u3956	m262	VICKI	LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
L74620	u3952	m262	KNOX	What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
L74619	u3956	m262	VICKI	Yeah. Deja vu.
L74618	u3952	m262	KNOX	Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
L74468	u3956	m262	VICKI	It's gone.
L74467	u3952	m262	KNOX	Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
L74466	u3956	m262	VICKI	Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
L74465	u3952	m262	KNOX	Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
L74464	u3956	m262	VICKI	He's not crazy.
L74463	u3952	m262	KNOX	Not what?
L74462	u3956	m262	VICKI	Allie, he's not.
L74461	u3952	m262	KNOX	The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
L74310	u3952	m262	KNOX	Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
L74309	u3956	m262	VICKI	I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
L74308	u3952	m262	KNOX	Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
L74307	u3956	m262	VICKI	Alexander... I know you.
L74306	u3952	m262	KNOX	... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
L74305	u3956	m262	VICKI	He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
L74304	u3952	m262	KNOX	... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
L74303	u3956	m262	VICKI	Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
L74302	u3952	m262	KNOX	Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
L74301	u3956	m262	VICKI	Are they paying you for all this?
L74300	u3952	m262	KNOX	Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
L74299	u3956	m262	VICKI	You are on drugs.
L74298	u3952	m262	KNOX	Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
L74297	u3956	m262	VICKI	Oh, Bruce...
L74296	u3952	m262	KNOX	Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
L74295	u3956	m262	VICKI	His face.  Allie, look at his face.
L74294	u3952	m262	KNOX	Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
L74209	u3952	m262	KNOX	Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
L74208	u3956	m262	VICKI	Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
L74206	u3952	m262	KNOX	Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
L74205	u3956	m262	VICKI	Peanuts?
L74200	u3952	m262	KNOX	Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
L74199	u3956	m262	VICKI	Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
L74172	u3952	m262	KNOX	Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
L74171	u3956	m262	VICKI	Yum, yum.
L74170	u3952	m262	KNOX	What were you thinking?
L74169	u3956	m262	VICKI	Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
L74151	u3952	m262	KNOX	Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
L74150	u3956	m262	VICKI	That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
L74149	u3952	m262	KNOX	I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
L74148	u3952	m262	KNOX	Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
L74147	u3956	m262	VICKI	Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
L74145	u3952	m262	KNOX	Holy shit...
L74144	u3956	m262	VICKI	All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
L74143	u3952	m262	KNOX	Where does one man get all this junk?
L74135	u3956	m262	VICKI	Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
L74134	u3952	m262	KNOX	Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
L74113	u3952	m262	KNOX	Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
L74112	u3956	m262	VICKI	No.
L74111	u3952	m262	KNOX	Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
L74110	u3956	m262	VICKI	Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
L74109	u3952	m262	KNOX	Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
L74108	u3956	m262	VICKI	Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
L74107	u3952	m262	KNOX	Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
L74106	u3956	m262	VICKI	A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
L74105	u3952	m262	KNOX	God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
L74104	u3952	m262	KNOX	Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
L74103	u3956	m262	VICKI	Burned out.  I need a vacation.
L74102	u3952	m262	KNOX	Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
L74101	u3956	m262	VICKI	How'd you know it was me?
L77397	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
L77396	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	You already said that, Butt-Head.

L77380	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.

L77374	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
L77363	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
L77362	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
L77361	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
L77360	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.

L76705	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	This sucks.

L76829	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
L76828	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Really? I poop too much.
L76827	u3977	m264	MARTHA	You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
L76826	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...

L76800	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Yeah, we're gonna score.
L76799	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
L77349	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Thrr...

L77347	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	...Two...
L77343	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
L77342	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
L77341	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
L77340	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
L77337	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
L77336	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
L77335	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
L77334	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
L77333	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Who knows?
L77332	u3972	m264	BORK	Where are his pants?
L77331	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
L77329	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
L77328	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, look!
L77327	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
L77326	u3972	m264	BORK	We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
L77319	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Not now Bork.
L77318	u3972	m264	BORK	Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
L77296	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Agent Hurley...
L77295	u3972	m264	BORK	Not on him, Chief.
L77253	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
L77252	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
L77251	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
L77199	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
L77198	u3972	m264	BORK	D.C., Chief.
L77197	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
L77194	u3972	m264	BORK	Where did these guys come from?
L77193	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
L77129	u3972	m264	BORK	We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
L77128	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	That's better. Yes?
L77127	u3972	m264	BORK	Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
L77126	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
L77125	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
L77093	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Deep and hard.
L77092	u3972	m264	BORK	Cavity search...?
L77034	u3972	m264	BORK	It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
L77033	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
L77031	u3972	m264	BORK	Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
L77030	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
L77029	u3972	m264	BORK	Cut the power!
L77028	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
L77027	u3972	m264	BORK	I see it. I don't get it.
L77026	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	You see what I see, Bork?
L77003	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
L77002	u3972	m264	BORK	They look like a couple of kids chief.
L77001	u3972	m264	BORK	Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
L77000	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
L76999	u3972	m264	BORK	Ah, the witness?
L76998	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Did you give him a full cavity search?
L76997	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
L76996	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Talk ta me, Bork.
L76978	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
L76977	u3972	m264	BORK	We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
L77173	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
L77172	u3978	m264	MUDDY	Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
L76784	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
L76783	u3978	m264	MUDDY	She sure does.
L76782	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
L76781	u3978	m264	MUDDY	One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
L76778	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
L76777	u3978	m264	MUDDY	She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
L76776	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
L76775	u3978	m264	MUDDY	Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
L76767	u3978	m264	MUDDY	That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
L76766	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Do her? Huh huh.
L76763	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, Butt-Head.
L76762	u3978	m264	MUDDY	Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
L77201	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
L77200	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
L76969	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
L76968	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
L76966	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
L76965	u3977	m264	MARTHA	This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
L76964	u3977	m264	MARTHA	That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
L76963	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Cool, huh huh huh.
L76806	u3977	m264	MARTHA	It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
L76805	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Cool. Huh huh huh.
L77142	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
L77141	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
L77140	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
L77138	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
L77137	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	You scored with two chicks?!
L77136	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
L77135	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Really? That's where we're from.
L77132	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Yup. Huh huh.
L77131	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
L77117	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
L77116	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
L76924	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
L76923	u3974	m264	DALLAS	Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
L76922	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, ten uh...
L76921	u3974	m264	DALLAS	Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
L76920	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
L76919	u3974	m264	DALLAS	Who sent ya?
L76918	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
L76917	u3974	m264	DALLAS	You got two seconds!
L90110	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I want to see the sun rise.
L90109	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you want me to do?
L90106	u4071	m271	BLADE	Not good.
L90105	u4076	m271	NYSSA	How does it look?
L90012	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I don't understand.
L90011	u4071	m271	BLADE	"It means ""bloodbrother."""
L90003	u4071	m271	BLADE	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
L90002	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're hurting me.
L90000	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
L89999	u4071	m271	BLADE	I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
L89998	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Why do you hate us so much?
L89997	u4076	m271	NYSSA	If that's true, then why'd you save me?
L89996	u4071	m271	BLADE	Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
L89995	u4076	m271	NYSSA	It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
L89994	u4071	m271	BLADE	Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
L89993	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Why?
L89992	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't want to go there.
L89991	u4071	m271	BLADE	I wouldn't read too much into it.
L89990	u4076	m271	NYSSA	It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
L89989	u4071	m271	BLADE	For what?
L89988	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Thank you.
L89987	u4071	m271	BLADE	I don't think so.
L89986	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Anyone else make it?
L89985	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.
L89984	u4071	m271	BLADE	What?
L89983	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Each day is a little life.
L89974	u4071	m271	BLADE	Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
L89973	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Blade.
L89952	u4071	m271	BLADE	Fry 'em.
L89951	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
L89909	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
L89908	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't have to hunt to do it.
L89907	u4076	m271	NYSSA	He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
L89871	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
L89870	u4071	m271	BLADE	Like cancer with a purpose.
L89869	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
L89864	u4071	m271	BLADE	Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
L89863	u4076	m271	NYSSA	If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
L89862	u4071	m271	BLADE	No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
L89861	u4071	m271	BLADE	Time.
L89860	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
L89859	u4071	m271	BLADE	Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
L89858	u4076	m271	NYSSA	From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
L89857	u4071	m271	BLADE	Recognize him?
L89826	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Minutes.
L89825	u4071	m271	BLADE	how long since he was bitten?
L89821	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I didn't know.
L89820	u4071	m271	BLADE	He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
L89819	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What about Nomak?
L89818	u4071	m271	BLADE	I'll heal.
L89817	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're hurt.
L89804	u4071	m271	BLADE	Nothing.
L89803	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What was that?
L89796	u4076	m271	NYSSA	We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
L89795	u4071	m271	BLADE	What is it with you people and pain?
L89791	u4071	m271	BLADE	I haven't forgotten.
L89790	u4076	m271	NYSSA	This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
L89778	u4076	m271	NYSSA	The House of Pain.
L89777	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where to first?
L89759	u4071	m271	BLADE	We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
L89758	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What the hell are you doing, Blade?
L89757	u4071	m271	BLADE	You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
L89743	u4076	m271	NYSSA	No.  They've been training to hunt you.
L89742	u4071	m271	BLADE	"Then they weren't created to go after your ""patient zero""."
L89741	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Two years.
L89736	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
L89735	u4071	m271	BLADE	Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
L89730	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Survival.
L89729	u4071	m271	BLADE	Why?
L89712	u4076	m271	NYSSA	They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
L89711	u4071	m271	BLADE	What?
L90089	u4071	m271	BLADE	Blood...
L90088	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
L90021	u4071	m271	BLADE	Then who does he work for?
L90020	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
L90019	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
L90018	u4071	m271	BLADE	What's your problem, Whistler?
L90016	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Just out connecting a few dots.
L90015	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where the hell have you been?
L90014	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Your security's for shit, kid.
L89939	u4071	m271	BLADE	We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
L89938	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
L89892	u4071	m271	BLADE	It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
L89891	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
L89890	u4071	m271	BLADE	Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
L89889	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
L89888	u4071	m271	BLADE	I wouldn't worry about it.
L89887	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
L89841	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I'll show you.
L89840	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where were you, Whistler?
L89835	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
L89834	u4071	m271	BLADE	I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
L89787	u4071	m271	BLADE	I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
L89786	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I don't like it.
L89785	u4071	m271	BLADE	He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
L89747	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
L89746	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you really think?
L89745	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Sounds like a plan.
L89744	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you think?
L89709	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Either that or feeding the worms.
L89708	u4071	m271	BLADE	I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
L89675	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
L89674	u4071	m271	BLADE	Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
L89673	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Took you long enough.
L89672	u4071	m271	BLADE	Did you think I wouldn't?
L89671	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You came back for me.
L89670	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
L89669	u4071	m271	BLADE	How do you feel?
L90043	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
L90042	u4071	m271	BLADE	Thought you were dead.
L90041	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Put it back in park, Blade.
L89947	u4071	m271	BLADE	So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
L89946	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	So?
L89945	u4071	m271	BLADE	Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
L89882	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
L89881	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
L89880	u4071	m271	BLADE	Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
L89879	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	And so will we.
L90080	u4071	m271	BLADE	Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
L90079	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	And why is that?
L90078	u4071	m271	BLADE	Too bad you're out of it.
L90077	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
L90037	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	I should think that would be obvious at this point.
L90036	u4071	m271	BLADE	The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
L89738	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Not alone.
L89737	u4071	m271	BLADE	You want me to hunt them for you.
L89722	u4071	m271	BLADE	For what?
L89721	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
L90058	u4071	m271	BLADE	Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
L90057	u4078	m271	SCUD	So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
L90047	u4078	m271	SCUD	You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
L90046	u4071	m271	BLADE	Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
L90008	u4071	m271	BLADE	He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
L90007	u4078	m271	SCUD	Nomak?
L90006	u4071	m271	BLADE	He was here.  Watching us.
L90005	u4078	m271	SCUD	What's going on?
L89749	u4071	m271	BLADE	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
L89748	u4078	m271	SCUD	So you're going to do this?
L89693	u4071	m271	BLADE	Human?
L89692	u4078	m271	SCUD	Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
L89664	u4078	m271	SCUD	I don't know about this, man --
L89663	u4071	m271	BLADE	Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
L89662	u4071	m271	BLADE	Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
L89661	u4078	m271	SCUD	You got something in mind, Blade?
L89950	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
L89949	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What the fuck you doing?
L89942	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
L89941	u4072	m271	CHUPA	We want to attract them, not scare them off.
L89839	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
L89838	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
L89837	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
L89836	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
L89770	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
L89769	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Getting your attention, Paco.
L89768	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
L90097	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Maybe it's better that way.
L90096	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
L90095	u4076	m271	NYSSA	We're locked in.
L90072	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You experimented on your own, son?
L90071	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	From his father, of course.
L90070	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
L90069	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
L89734	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
L89733	u4076	m271	NYSSA	His name is Jared Nomak.
L89854	u4079	m271	STEVENS	As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
L89853	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
L89851	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
L89850	u4079	m271	STEVENS	No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
L89849	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
L89848	u4079	m271	STEVENS	Two so far.
L89847	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Any casualties?
L89846	u4079	m271	STEVENS	They've made contact with the Reapers.
L89845	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Yes?
L89643	u4074	m271	NOMAK	Us?  What are you talking about?
L89642	u4075	m271	NURSE	Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
L89640	u4075	m271	NURSE	It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
L89639	u4074	m271	NOMAK	No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
L89638	u4075	m271	NURSE	Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
L89637	u4074	m271	NOMAK	Not that I'm in contact with.
L89636	u4075	m271	NURSE	I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
L90054	u4078	m271	SCUD	Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
L90053	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You little shit.  When did they get to you?
L90052	u4078	m271	SCUD	Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
L89929	u4078	m271	SCUD	After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
L89928	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What about you?  You're not coming?
L89921	u4078	m271	SCUD	"I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take ""E"", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, ""Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"""
L89920	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Pretty.
L89919	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
L89918	u4078	m271	SCUD	Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
L89917	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Going on twenty years now.
L89916	u4078	m271	SCUD	So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
L89915	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Nope.  Back then we did not.
L89914	u4078	m271	SCUD	Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
L89913	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You're wasting your time, already been tried.
L89912	u4078	m271	SCUD	Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
L89911	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	The hell are you fiddling with there?
L89707	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
L89706	u4078	m271	SCUD	This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
L89691	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
L89690	u4078	m271	SCUD	Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
L89688	u4078	m271	SCUD	Look, what's your problem?
L89687	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
L89686	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
L89685	u4078	m271	SCUD	Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
L89684	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
L89683	u4078	m271	SCUD	The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
L89682	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
L89681	u4078	m271	SCUD	Scud.
L89680	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Tell me something, Skid --
L89499	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
L89498	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler, I --
L89494	u4081	m272	BLADE	No, we can treat the wounds --
L89493	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
L89492	u4081	m272	BLADE	Don't try to talk --
L89391	u4081	m272	BLADE	China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
L89390	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Going somewhere?
L89345	u4081	m272	BLADE	Don't even start, old man.
L89344	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	What took you so long?
L89183	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Wait.
L89182	u4081	m272	BLADE	Get in. You?re leaving.
L89164	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
L89163	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
L89162	u4081	m272	BLADE	Stupidity.
L89151	u4081	m272	BLADE	Just do it, old man.
L89150	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
L89126	u4081	m272	BLADE	She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
L89125	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You should've killed her, then.
L89124	u4081	m272	BLADE	She's been bitten.
L89123	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Are we bringing home strays now?
L89122	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler!
L89628	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's because I'm human that I can do this.
L89627	u4084	m272	FROST	You're too human, Blade.
L89625	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
L89624	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
L89623	u4081	m272	BLADE	Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
L89608	u4084	m272	FROST	Take him.
L89607	u4081	m272	BLADE	Who dies first?
L89606	u4081	m272	BLADE	Frost!!!
L89605	u4084	m272	FROST	No longer.
L89437	u4084	m272	FROST	Watch me.
L89436	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're not going anywhere.
L89432	u4084	m272	FROST	You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
L89431	u4081	m272	BLADE	Pass.
L89430	u4084	m272	FROST	The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
L89428	u4084	m272	FROST	Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
L89427	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're wrong.
L89426	u4084	m272	FROST	Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
L89425	u4081	m272	BLADE	Maybe I don't see it that way.
L89424	u4084	m272	FROST	Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
L89423	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't buy it.
L89422	u4084	m272	FROST	"It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, ""the Day-walker""."
L89421	u4084	m272	FROST	I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
L89420	u4081	m272	BLADE	How can you be out here?
L89419	u4084	m272	FROST	Beautiful day, isn't it?
L89488	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	You've been here longer than you think.
L89487	u4081	m272	BLADE	But I just got here --
L89486	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	I am tired. Dawn is coming.
L89484	u4081	m272	BLADE	How do I stop it?
L89483	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
L89482	u4081	m272	BLADE	The Blood Tide.
L89481	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	"The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  ""And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."""
L89478	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
L89477	u4081	m272	BLADE	Who is LaMagra?
L89476	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
L89474	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Show me.
L89473	u4081	m272	BLADE	I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
L89472	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Hold out your hands.
L89470	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	There are other ways to see. Sit.
L89469	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're blind --
L89468	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Is something wrong, my friend?
L89631	u4081	m272	BLADE	For them. But for me --
L89630	u4086	m272	KAREN	I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
L89598	u4086	m272	KAREN	Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
L89597	u4081	m272	BLADE	I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
L89596	u4086	m272	KAREN	It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
L89595	u4081	m272	BLADE	No --
L89594	u4086	m272	KAREN	I know. Take some of my blood.
L89593	u4081	m272	BLADE	-- tearing me -- apart.
L89592	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't understand. The Thirst --
L89591	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm not leaving without you.
L89590	u4081	m272	BLADE	Get out of here --
L89544	u4081	m272	BLADE	What are you talking about?
L89543	u4086	m272	KAREN	It won't work on you.
L89542	u4081	m272	BLADE	We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
L89541	u4086	m272	KAREN	Is it bad?
L89540	u4086	m272	KAREN	I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
L89539	u4081	m272	BLADE	How long have we been driving?
L89538	u4081	m272	BLADE	I've been better --
L89537	u4086	m272	KAREN	Are you all right?
L89447	u4086	m272	KAREN	You make it sound like I'm already dead.
L89446	u4081	m272	BLADE	For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
L89442	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
L89441	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't look so good.
L89440	u4086	m272	KAREN	Some. It's been slow --
L89439	u4081	m272	BLADE	Any progress?
L89403	u4081	m272	BLADE	Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
L89402	u4086	m272	KAREN	My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
L89401	u4081	m272	BLADE	We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
L89400	u4086	m272	KAREN	You care about him, don't you?
L89399	u4081	m272	BLADE	Cancer.
L89398	u4086	m272	KAREN	Is he sick?
L89393	u4081	m272	BLADE	For your miracle cure?
L89392	u4086	m272	KAREN	I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
L89380	u4086	m272	KAREN	Blade --
L89379	u4081	m272	BLADE	Just get out of here.
L89378	u4086	m272	KAREN	If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
L89377	u4081	m272	BLADE	I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
L89376	u4086	m272	KAREN	Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
L89375	u4081	m272	BLADE	I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
L89373	u4081	m272	BLADE	You get used to the darkness.
L89372	u4086	m272	KAREN	It's dark in here.
L89341	u4081	m272	BLADE	Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
L89340	u4086	m272	KAREN	What am I injecting you with?
L89338	u4081	m272	BLADE	Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
L89337	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're hurt --
L89295	u4081	m272	BLADE	You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
L89294	u4086	m272	KAREN	Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
L89293	u4081	m272	BLADE	Some kind of archive --
L89292	u4086	m272	KAREN	What is this place?
L89284	u4081	m272	BLADE	Like me.
L89283	u4086	m272	KAREN	Like what?
L89282	u4081	m272	BLADE	There are worse things than vampires out there.
L89281	u4086	m272	KAREN	So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
L89279	u4081	m272	BLADE	The way they move, they way they smell --
L89278	u4086	m272	KAREN	How can you tell?
L89277	u4081	m272	BLADE	Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
L89270	u4081	m272	BLADE	He will.
L89269	u4086	m272	KAREN	You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
L89255	u4081	m272	BLADE	Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
L89254	u4086	m272	KAREN	I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
L89252	u4081	m272	BLADE	Look closer.
L89251	u4086	m272	KAREN	Graffiti --
L89250	u4081	m272	BLADE	What do you see here?
L89249	u4086	m272	KAREN	What are you looking at?
L89248	u4086	m272	KAREN	You don't know that.
L89247	u4081	m272	BLADE	There is no cure.
L89246	u4086	m272	KAREN	Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
L89231	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
L89230	u4086	m272	KAREN	You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
L89229	u4081	m272	BLADE	Preventive medicine.
L89228	u4086	m272	KAREN	What are you doing?!
L89223	u4081	m272	BLADE	For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
L89222	u4086	m272	KAREN	And that's a good thing?
L89221	u4081	m272	BLADE	Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
L89220	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
L89219	u4081	m272	BLADE	That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
L89218	u4081	m272	BLADE	He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
L89217	u4086	m272	KAREN	But he's a policeman --
L89216	u4081	m272	BLADE	He didn't. Get over it.
L89215	u4086	m272	KAREN	But, he could've --
L89214	u4081	m272	BLADE	It worked, didn't it?
L89213	u4086	m272	KAREN	You used me as bait?!
L89212	u4081	m272	BLADE	Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
L89211	u4086	m272	KAREN	How did you know?
L89180	u4086	m272	KAREN	That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
L89179	u4081	m272	BLADE	Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
L89178	u4086	m272	KAREN	I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
L89176	u4081	m272	BLADE	Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
L89175	u4086	m272	KAREN	I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
L89174	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
L89173	u4086	m272	KAREN	And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
L89167	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens then?
L89166	u4081	m272	BLADE	Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
L89165	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why?
L89158	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're joking --
L89157	u4081	m272	BLADE	-- he's a vampire.
L89153	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm sorry, I --
L89152	u4081	m272	BLADE	You shouldn't be here.
L89411	u4085	m272	KAM	There's only one alternative to the serum.
L89410	u4081	m272	BLADE	Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
L89409	u4085	m272	KAM	I was afraid that might happen.
L89408	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
L89407	u4081	m272	BLADE	I was in the neighborhood.
L89406	u4085	m272	KAM	You're a week early.
L89405	u4081	m272	BLADE	How's it going, Kam?
L89576	u4088	m272	VANESSA	You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
L89575	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't believe that.
L89574	u4088	m272	VANESSA	I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
L89573	u4088	m272	VANESSA	You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
L89572	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't have to be.
L89571	u4088	m272	VANESSA	These are my people now. I'm one of them.
L89570	u4081	m272	BLADE	How could you be a part of this?
L89534	u4088	m272	VANESSA	Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
L89533	u4081	m272	BLADE	Please --
L89529	u4081	m272	BLADE	Fight him --
L89528	u4088	m272	VANESSA	Deacon brought me back.
L89527	u4081	m272	BLADE	But you -- died --
L89116	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
L89115	u4086	m272	KAREN	-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
L89114	u4086	m272	KAREN	Sometimes --
L89113	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
L89112	u4082	m272	CURTIS	He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
L89111	u4086	m272	KAREN	What?
L89110	u4082	m272	CURTIS	That's weird --
L89109	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
L89108	u4086	m272	KAREN	You haven't started in on the internal organs?
L89107	u4082	m272	CURTIS	No problem.
L89106	u4086	m272	KAREN	"Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about ""us""."
L89105	u4082	m272	CURTIS	This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
L89104	u4086	m272	KAREN	I thought you promised to give me some distance?
L89103	u4082	m272	CURTIS	It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
L89102	u4086	m272	KAREN	Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
L89100	u4082	m272	CURTIS	What about the chemistry panel?
L89099	u4086	m272	KAREN	The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
L89098	u4086	m272	KAREN	I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
L89097	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Then what is it?
L89096	u4086	m272	KAREN	This isn't human blood.
L89386	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	The other elders will never let you get away with this!
L89385	u4084	m272	FROST	How do you like that? Right on time.
L89191	u4084	m272	FROST	Perhaps.
L89190	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
L89189	u4084	m272	FROST	Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
L89188	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
L89146	u4084	m272	FROST	Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
L89145	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
L89141	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	He is an abomination!
L89140	u4084	m272	FROST	Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
L89139	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	"I see. And what would you have us do with this ""half-breed""?"
L89138	u4084	m272	FROST	Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
L89137	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
L89136	u4084	m272	FROST	The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
L89135	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wrong, Dragonetti.
L89134	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
L89621	u4086	m272	KAREN	Get away from him!
L89620	u4084	m272	FROST	I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
L89554	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
L89553	u4086	m272	KAREN	Blade --
L89520	u4084	m272	FROST	Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
L89519	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're a monster.
L89517	u4084	m272	FROST	Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
L89516	u4086	m272	KAREN	But you use blood banks --
L89515	u4084	m272	FROST	What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
L89514	u4086	m272	KAREN	There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
L89513	u4084	m272	FROST	Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
L89512	u4086	m272	KAREN	You.
L89511	u4084	m272	FROST	LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
L89510	u4084	m272	FROST	That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
L89509	u4086	m272	KAREN	LaMagra --
L89508	u4084	m272	FROST	The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
L89507	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens then?
L89506	u4084	m272	FROST	A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
L89505	u4086	m272	KAREN	How many of you are there?
L89462	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
L89461	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happened to the power?
L89460	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
L89459	u4086	m272	KAREN	On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
L89457	u4086	m272	KAREN	With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
L89456	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	How?
L89455	u4086	m272	KAREN	Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
L89453	u4086	m272	KAREN	Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
L89452	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
L89451	u4086	m272	KAREN	All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
L89370	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'll take my chances.
L89369	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
L89368	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
L89367	u4086	m272	KAREN	And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
L89366	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
L89365	u4086	m272	KAREN	How did you escape?
L89364	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
L89363	u4086	m272	KAREN	He killed them?
L89362	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
L89361	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Habit, mostly, just like this.
L89360	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why do you hunt them?
L89358	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
L89357	u4086	m272	KAREN	No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
L89356	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
L89355	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
L89354	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
L89347	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	We weren't sure we could trust you.
L89346	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
L89335	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Go on, I'll be fine!
L89334	u4086	m272	KAREN	Whistler!
L89332	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
L89331	u4086	m272	KAREN	You've been listening in the whole time?
L89330	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	We keep in radio contact.
L89186	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
L89185	u4086	m272	KAREN	So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
L89184	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
L89171	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
L89170	u4086	m272	KAREN	So what do you use, then? A stake?
L89156	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
L89155	u4086	m272	KAREN	Who are you people?
L89131	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
L89130	u4086	m272	KAREN	What -- ?
L109038	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
L109037	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
L109036	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
L109035	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
L109034	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I'm going to Paris.
L109008	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
L109007	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	We don't know what we're into!
L109006	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What do you want to do?
L109005	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Forget it.
L109004	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
L109003	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
L109002	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	-- if we can get a clean shot --
L109001	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	-- he went inside! --
L108941	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	This doesn't go upstairs.
L108940	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
L108939	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	No.  We can't risk it.
L108915	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
L108914	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
L108913	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
L108778	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	I'm not asking.
L108777	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
L108776	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	I want a second opinion.
L108775	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
L108774	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
L108773	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
L108772	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
L108771	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
L108770	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
L108769	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
L108599	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
L108598	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	And what if I couldn't do that?
L108597	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
L108596	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
L108595	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I thought you were never going to do that.
L108594	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Yes.
L108593	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	You're asking me a direct question?
L108592	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
L108591	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	I don't know what we're talking about.
L108590	u4215	m282	ABBOTT	Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
L109103	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Why?
L109102	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...they won't let you go...
L109101	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What do they want me to do?
L109100	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
L109099	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I think so.
L109098	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
L109097	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What is Treadstone?
L109096	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
L109095	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Treadstone.
L109094	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...it's a problem...
L109093	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.
L109092	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
L109091	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Paris.  I live in Paris...
L109090	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	...which one are you?...
L109089	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Treadstone?
L109088	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
L109087	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What do you mean?
L109086	u4225	m282	PROFESSOR	I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
L109085	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I won't ask again.
L109135	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That'll be their second worst mistake.
L109134	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Jason...  They can't let you go...
L109133	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Keep it. 
L109132	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
L109131	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Jason Bourne is dead.
L109130	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We have to go home, Jason.
L109129	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't think so.
L109128	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
L109127	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That's all I get?
L109126	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	So it's time to go home.
L109125	u4216	m282	BOURNE	So now you know.
L109124	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
L109123	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I know you've been trying to kill me.
L109122	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
L109121	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L109120	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
L109119	u4216	m282	BOURNE	<u>What did you do to me</u>?
L109118	u4218	m282	CONKLIN	Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
L109117	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Are you Treadstone?
L109027	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	Get the kids out!
L109026	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L109025	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
L109023	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
L109022	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Who do you think sent me?
L109015	u4216	m282	BOURNE	It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
L109014	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
L109013	u4216	m282	BOURNE	MPG Capital.
L109012	u4231	m282	WOMBOSI	Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
L108637	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yeah, I know...
L108636	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	Sir, you waited on line.
L108635	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, maybe I should just...
L108634	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
L108633	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
L108632	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	You have your passport?
L108631	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Right.
L108630	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	Well, either you are, or you aren't.
L108629	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
L108628	u4230	m282	WOMAN CLERK	You're a U.S. Citizen?
L108827	u4224	m282	OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, sir.
L108826	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?

L108823	u4216	m282	BOURNE	D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
L108822	u4224	m282	OPERATOR/PHONE	One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
L108821	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.

L108819	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Paris?
L108817	u4216	m282	BOURNE	...yes -- oui -- uh...
L108843	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
L108842	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
L108841	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
L108840	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Right.  Yes.  Of course.
L108839	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	His brother.  You know his brother?
L108838	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Who?  Who came?
L108837	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
L108836	u4216	m282	BOURNE	...I understand...
L108835	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
L108834	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
L108833	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.
L108832	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	You are a friend of his?
L108831	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.  Is he there?
L108830	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
L108829	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes, I'm here...
L108828	u4221	m282	MANAGER/PHONE	Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
L108958	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That'd be great.
L108957	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
L108956	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I hadn't heard.
L108955	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
L108954	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Excuse me?
L108953	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Was it the break-in?
L108952	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Okay.
L108951	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
L108950	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yes.
L108949	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
L108948	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
L108947	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Did you?
L108946	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	We thought you were gone for good.
L108945	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Really.
L108944	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
L108943	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Thanks.
L108942	u4226	m282	RAWLINS	Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
L109145	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Not really.
L109144	u4222	m282	MARIE	You have ID?
L109143	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Think I could rent a scooter?
L109142	u4222	m282	MARIE	Yes.
L109141	u4216	m282	BOURNE	This your store?
L109140	u4222	m282	MARIE	Can I help you?
L109114	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
L109113	u4222	m282	MARIE	What about you?
L109112	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I can't protect you anymore.
L109111	u4222	m282	MARIE	What was I thinking, right?
L109110	u4216	m282	BOURNE	If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
L109109	u4222	m282	MARIE	And that's it?

L109041	u4222	m282	MARIE	Yes.  That's who I want to be.
L109040	u4216	m282	BOURNE	You could do that?
L109039	u4222	m282	MARIE	It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
L108993	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Go back to the hotel.
L108992	u4222	m282	MARIE	<u>So what are we doing</u>?
L108991	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know. 
L108990	u4222	m282	MARIE	What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
L108989	u4216	m282	BOURNE	It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
L108988	u4222	m282	MARIE	What is that?
L108987	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Nykwana Wombosi. 
L108986	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
L108960	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
L108959	u4222	m282	MARIE	I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
L108919	u4222	m282	MARIE	It's a company... MPG Capital.
L108918	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Who paid the bill?
L108917	u4222	m282	MARIE	You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
L108893	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
L108892	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- we'll tell them what happened --
L108891	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- forget it --
L108890	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --

L108888	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- we'll explain it --
L108887	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- there's no time --
L108886	u4222	m282	MARIE	But the police --
L108885	u4216	m282	BOURNE	You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
L108884	u4222	m282	MARIE	Oh, Jesus...
L108883	u4216	m282	BOURNE	And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
L108882	u4222	m282	MARIE	He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
L108881	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I didn't know this would happen.
L108880	u4222	m282	MARIE	I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
L108879	u4216	m282	BOURNE	You're wrong.  I didn't know.
L108878	u4222	m282	MARIE	I trusted you.
L108877	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.
L108876	u4222	m282	MARIE	You knew he was coming.
L108875	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
L108874	u4222	m282	MARIE	He came to kill us.
L108873	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
L108872	u4222	m282	MARIE	He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
L108871	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
L108870	u4222	m282	MARIE	He's dead isn't he?
L108866	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
L108865	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- let me do this, okay? --
L108864	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
L108863	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
L108862	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
L108861	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- just --
L108860	u4222	m282	MARIE	...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
L108859	u4216	m282	BOURNE	What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
L108858	u4222	m282	MARIE	...omigod, no...
L108857	u4216	m282	BOURNE	WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
L108854	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
L108853	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
L108850	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
L108849	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
L108848	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
L108814	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Go ahead.
L108813	u4222	m282	MARIE	See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
L108812	u4216	m282	BOURNE	All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
L108811	u4222	m282	MARIE	This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
L108809	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I guess so.
L108808	u4222	m282	MARIE	This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
L108799	u4216	m282	BOURNE	How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
L108798	u4222	m282	MARIE	Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
L108797	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
L108796	u4222	m282	MARIE	You got me pretty fucking curious.
L108795	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, I don't know what's up there.
L108794	u4222	m282	MARIE	Anytime.
L108793	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Thanks for the ride.
L108792	u4222	m282	MARIE	Okay, so...
L108790	u4222	m282	MARIE	Jason...
L108789	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't remember any of this.
L108788	u4222	m282	MARIE	I should go.
L108787	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I guess.
L108786	u4222	m282	MARIE	So this is it, right?
L108785	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
L108784	u4222	m282	MARIE	Where?
L108783	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
L108782	u4222	m282	MARIE	Looks familiar?
L108781	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Four-fifty.  That's the address...
L108780	u4222	m282	MARIE	That's it?  Is that it?
L108779	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
L108764	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I thought about it.  I don't know.
L108763	u4222	m282	MARIE	You ever think maybe you have a family?
L108762	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
L108761	u4222	m282	MARIE	You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
L108760	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I can't believe I slept.
L108759	u4222	m282	MARIE	We're about an hour away.
L108758	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Where are we?
L108757	u4222	m282	MARIE	I needed a break.
L108742	u4222	m282	MARIE	You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
L108741	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
L108740	u4222	m282	MARIE	People do amazing things when they're scared.
L108739	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
L108738	u4222	m282	MARIE	Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
L108737	u4216	m282	BOURNE	There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
L108736	u4222	m282	MARIE	Okay, so you're a victim.
L108735	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I was shot twice in the back.
L108734	u4222	m282	MARIE	Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
L108733	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L108732	u4222	m282	MARIE	What are you talking about?
L108731	u4216	m282	BOURNE	-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
L108730	u4222	m282	MARIE	-- you could put it together --
L108729	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
L108728	u4222	m282	MARIE	Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
L108727	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Nothing.  It's just not there.
L108726	u4222	m282	MARIE	When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
L108725	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.
L108724	u4222	m282	MARIE	And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
L108718	u4216	m282	BOURNE	That's what I'm saying.
L108717	u4222	m282	MARIE	Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
L108716	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
L108715	u4222	m282	MARIE	What?  Like amnesia?
L108714	u4216	m282	BOURNE	No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
L108713	u4222	m282	MARIE	Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
L108712	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
L108711	u4222	m282	MARIE	Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
L108710	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Listen to what you want.
L108709	u4222	m282	MARIE	What does that mean?
L108708	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't know.
L108707	u4222	m282	MARIE	I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
L108706	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
L108705	u4222	m282	MARIE	Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
L108704	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I know that.
L108703	u4222	m282	MARIE	Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
L108701	u4216	m282	BOURNE	Then I'll find another ride.
L108700	u4222	m282	MARIE	What if I say no?
L108699	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I won't hurt you.
L108698	u4222	m282	MARIE	And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
L108697	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
L108696	u4222	m282	MARIE	You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
L108695	u4216	m282	BOURNE	I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.

L128931	u4449	m295	ARLO	Even though it is nice to see Andy...

L128884	u4449	m295	ARLO	Yeah, baby!
L128883	u4460	m295	MASON	 Whoo!
L128882	u4449	m295	ARLO	That is loud!  I'm 
L128876	u4449	m295	ARLO	Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
L128874	u4449	m295	ARLO	...miles.
L128873	u4449	m295	ARLO	Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
L128872	u4460	m295	MASON	...split.
L128871	u4460	m295	MASON	Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
L128870	u4449	m295	ARLO	...shit.
L128869	u4449	m295	ARLO	...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
L128868	u4449	m295	ARLO	...-er.  It was your friend...
L128867	u4449	m295	ARLO	...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
L128866	u4449	m295	ARLO	I mean, if that gun was...
L128865	u4449	m295	ARLO	Not completely, anyway.
L128864	u4449	m295	ARLO	To tell you the truth, you didn't.
L128863	u4460	m295	MASON	...shit.
L128862	u4460	m295	MASON	...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
L128861	u4460	m295	MASON	Listen, Arlo...
L128823	u4460	m295	MASON	We got two paddles.
L128822	u4449	m295	ARLO	Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
L128821	u4460	m295	MASON	Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
L128820	u4460	m295	MASON	And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
L128819	u4460	m295	MASON	Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
L128818	u4460	m295	MASON	Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
L128817	u4460	m295	MASON	...hospital.
L128816	u4460	m295	MASON	And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
L128815	u4460	m295	MASON	We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
L128814	u4449	m295	ARLO	I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
L128813	u4460	m295	MASON	Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
L128812	u4449	m295	ARLO	Robert Del Rio?
L128811	u4460	m295	MASON	Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
L128810	u4449	m295	ARLO	How wonderful for you.
L128809	u4460	m295	MASON	We were nationally  ranked.
L128808	u4460	m295	MASON	You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
L128786	u4449	m295	ARLO	You know.
L128785	u4460	m295	MASON	 Yeah.
L128784	u4449	m295	ARLO	So I took his truck, yeah.
L128783	u4460	m295	MASON	...truck.
L128782	u4460	m295	MASON	So you took his...
L128781	u4449	m295	ARLO	Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
L128780	u4449	m295	ARLO	...overdrawn bank accounts.
L128779	u4449	m295	ARLO	...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
L128778	u4449	m295	ARLO	...or nephew or some good old boy...
L128777	u4449	m295	ARLO	...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
L128776	u4449	m295	ARLO	And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
L128775	u4449	m295	ARLO	I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
L128774	u4449	m295	ARLO	You know what I'm sayin'?
L128773	u4460	m295	MASON	It won't even start half the time.
L128772	u4449	m295	ARLO	...piece of shit was worth.
L128771	u4449	m295	ARLO	Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
L128770	u4460	m295	MASON	...stole the truck.
L128769	u4460	m295	MASON	Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
L128768	u4449	m295	ARLO	...-tion?
L128767	u4449	m295	ARLO	See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
L128766	u4460	m295	MASON	You're fucked, man.
L128765	u4449	m295	ARLO	...did you?
L128764	u4449	m295	ARLO	Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
L128762	u4449	m295	ARLO	Worth a try.
L128761	u4449	m295	ARLO	Okay.
L128760	u4460	m295	MASON	This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
L128759	u4449	m295	ARLO	This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
L128758	u4460	m295	MASON	What?
L128757	u4449	m295	ARLO	Uh-oh.

L128707	u4449	m295	ARLO	Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.

L128251	u4460	m295	MASON	What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
L128250	u4449	m295	ARLO	Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
L128249	u4460	m295	MASON	You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
L128248	u4449	m295	ARLO	What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.

L128235	u4449	m295	ARLO	No.
L128234	u4460	m295	MASON	I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.

L128222	u4449	m295	ARLO	Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.

L128072	u4449	m295	ARLO	Oh.
L128071	u4460	m295	MASON	Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
L128070	u4449	m295	ARLO	Huh?
L128069	u4449	m295	ARLO	That'll make up the difference, huh?
L128068	u4449	m295	ARLO	...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
L128067	u4449	m295	ARLO	...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...

L128062	u4460	m295	MASON	He could've called first.
L128061	u4449	m295	ARLO	Except for the fact that I need cash.
L128060	u4449	m295	ARLO	Uh, huh?
L128059	u4449	m295	ARLO	Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.

L128056	u4449	m295	ARLO	Well, he told me to collect cash.
L128054	u4460	m295	MASON	Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
L128052	u4449	m295	ARLO	Since today.  New policy.
L128051	u4460	m295	MASON	...Darlene pay you in cash?
L128050	u4460	m295	MASON	Since when does...
L128049	u4449	m295	ARLO	Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
L128048	u4460	m295	MASON	Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
L128047	u4449	m295	ARLO	Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
L128046	u4460	m295	MASON	The guy's a fuckin' moron.
L128045	u4449	m295	ARLO	No argument there.
L128044	u4460	m295	MASON	That's my business.
L127990	u4460	m295	MASON	Art.
L127989	u4449	m295	ARLO	Great.

L127987	u4449	m295	ARLO	Where do you want this stuff?
L127986	u4449	m295	ARLO	Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
L127985	u4460	m295	MASON	Where's Sam?
L127984	u4449	m295	ARLO	...-ty.
L127983	u4449	m295	ARLO	...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
L127982	u4449	m295	ARLO	Oh...

L129102	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	But...
L129101	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	And it won't be pleasant. 
L128913	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Three seconds.  One...
L128912	u4449	m295	ARLO	Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
L128911	u4449	m295	ARLO	Well, well, well.
L128910	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	...without compunction.
L128909	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	This country trained me to kill...
L128908	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	I urge you to be persuasive.
L128536	u4449	m295	ARLO	Oh, my God.
L128535	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
L128512	u4449	m295	ARLO	I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
L128511	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
L128510	u4449	m295	ARLO	...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
L128509	u4449	m295	ARLO	I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
L128508	u4449	m295	ARLO	Listen, shithead!
L128503	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
L128502	u4449	m295	ARLO	What'd he say?
L128496	u4449	m295	ARLO	It's for you.
L128495	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	...within five minutes.
L128494	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
L128188	u4449	m295	ARLO	I'll keep an eye out.
L128187	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	...about him.
L128186	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	We're worried...
L128185	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
L128183	u4449	m295	ARLO	That was quick.
L128182	u4449	m295	ARLO	Be cool.  Be--

L127876	u4453	m295	DARLENE	
L127875	u4453	m295	DARLENE	His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
L127874	u4459	m295	LONG	Ah.

L127866	u4459	m295	LONG	Oh, no?
L127865	u4453	m295	DARLENE	Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.

L128446	u4458	m295	LEWIS	Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
L128445	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.

L137284	u4548	m300	JESSIE	He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
L136935	u4545	m300	FRANK	They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
L136934	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Hal's signalling he's OK.

L137152	u4547	m300	HAL	A monkey?
L137151	u4545	m300	FRANK	What usually eats a banana?
L137150	u4547	m300	HAL	Surprise me.
L137149	u4545	m300	FRANK	So, what do you see?

L137642	u4546	m300	GABE	You're getting warmer!

L137633	u4546	m300	GABE	Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
L137632	u4551	m300	QUALEN	I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
L137631	u4546	m300	GABE	Jessie!  Are you alright?
L137625	u4546	m300	GABE	Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
L137624	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Tucker?
L137256	u4546	m300	GABE	I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
L137255	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Go on, fetch.
L137247	u4551	m300	QUALEN	A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
L137246	u4546	m300	GABE	Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
L137242	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  Step into my office.
L137241	u4546	m300	GABE	Bags?
L137240	u4551	m300	QUALEN	You know how the airlines are.
L137231	u4551	m300	QUALEN	This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
L137230	u4546	m300	GABE	It can't fly in this weather.
L137229	u4551	m300	QUALEN	That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
L137640	u4546	m300	GABE	You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
L137639	u4547	m300	HAL	Take the gun.
L137638	u4546	m300	GABE	Not on that leg.
L137637	u4547	m300	HAL	I'm going with you.
L137636	u4546	m300	GABE	Give him the money.
L137635	u4547	m300	HAL	What are we going to do?
L137621	u4547	m300	HAL	Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
L137620	u4546	m300	GABE	Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
L137619	u4546	m300	GABE	How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
L137616	u4546	m300	GABE	My pleasure.
L137615	u4547	m300	HAL	Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
L137262	u4546	m300	GABE	Would you?
L137261	u4547	m300	HAL	Forget me.  If you can, get away.
L137221	u4546	m300	GABE	If you want, do it.  I don't care.
L137220	u4547	m300	HAL	No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
L137219	u4546	m300	GABE	And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
L137218	u4547	m300	HAL	What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
L137217	u4546	m300	GABE	Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
L137216	u4547	m300	HAL	We'll never know, will we?
L137215	u4546	m300	GABE	There wasn't time for anything else.
L137214	u4547	m300	HAL	Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
L137213	u4546	m300	GABE	I did what I thought was right.
L137212	u4547	m300	HAL	You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
L137211	u4546	m300	GABE	Look, I know--
L137210	u4547	m300	HAL	Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
L137209	u4546	m300	GABE	I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
L137208	u4547	m300	HAL	You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
L137207	u4546	m300	GABE	When we get this group down, I'm gone.
L137206	u4547	m300	HAL	Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
L137205	u4546	m300	GABE	I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
L137204	u4547	m300	HAL	What the hell are you doing here?!
L136999	u4547	m300	HAL	Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
L136998	u4546	m300	GABE	She's losing it!
L136991	u4546	m300	GABE	The clip's not gonna hold!
L136990	u4547	m300	HAL	No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
L136989	u4546	m300	GABE	I'm coming out!
L136965	u4547	m300	HAL	Hey, fuck you.
L136964	u4546	m300	GABE	Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
L136953	u4547	m300	HAL	Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
L136952	u4546	m300	GABE	Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
L136951	u4547	m300	HAL	I love you, too.
L136950	u4546	m300	GABE	Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
L136949	u4547	m300	HAL	I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
L136948	u4546	m300	GABE	Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
L136947	u4547	m300	HAL	Glad you could drop in.
L137004	u4546	m300	GABE	You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
L137003	u4552	m300	SARAH	Help me!  I don't want to die!
L137002	u4546	m300	GABE	Use your other hand!  Grab it!
L137001	u4546	m300	GABE	I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
L137000	u4552	m300	SARAH	Please -- oh, no -- please!
L136982	u4552	m300	SARAH	Six...
L136981	u4546	m300	GABE	Nice and easy...
L136980	u4552	m300	SARAH	Four...five...
L136979	u4552	m300	SARAH	Three...
L136978	u4546	m300	GABE	That's it, you look like a professional.
L136977	u4552	m300	SARAH	Two...
L136976	u4552	m300	SARAH	One...
L136975	u4546	m300	GABE	There you go.
L136974	u4552	m300	SARAH	I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
L136973	u4546	m300	GABE	Sure you can.
L136972	u4552	m300	SARAH	Can I count as fast as I like?
L136971	u4546	m300	GABE	Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
L136970	u4552	m300	SARAH	Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
L136967	u4552	m300	SARAH	Okay--I don't know about this.
L136966	u4546	m300	GABE	Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
L136960	u4552	m300	SARAH	Is it really four thousand?
L136959	u4546	m300	GABE	She's tough.
L136956	u4546	m300	GABE	Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
L136955	u4552	m300	SARAH	Fine, I guess...
L136954	u4546	m300	GABE	How're ya feeling?
L136946	u4552	m300	SARAH	Hi, Gabe.
L136945	u4546	m300	GABE	Room service...Hi, Sarah.
L137668	u4546	m300	GABE	And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
L137667	u4548	m300	JESSIE	There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
L137666	u4546	m300	GABE	"The ""old mouth to mouth"" resuscitation routine."
L137650	u4546	m300	GABE	RUN, DAMMIT!!
L137649	u4548	m300	JESSIE	What about you?!
L137569	u4546	m300	GABE	Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
L137568	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
L137567	u4546	m300	GABE	Just kidding.
L137563	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
L137562	u4546	m300	GABE	Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
L137561	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Forget it!  I refuse!
L137560	u4546	m300	GABE	An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
L137559	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
L137558	u4546	m300	GABE	Wrap it around that rock twice.
L137557	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
L137556	u4546	m300	GABE	Take the rope.
L137555	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I won't do it.  No way.
L137554	u4546	m300	GABE	Take the rope.
L137553	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
L137552	u4546	m300	GABE	We don't have time to argue about it!
L137551	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
L137550	u4546	m300	GABE	But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
L137549	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
L137548	u4546	m300	GABE	What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
L137547	u4548	m300	JESSIE	What about you?
L137546	u4546	m300	GABE	That's exactly what I want you to do.
L137545	u4548	m300	JESSIE	My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
L137529	u4546	m300	GABE	Time is money -- please.
L137528	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
L137527	u4546	m300	GABE	"There's no ""we"".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face."
L137526	u4548	m300	JESSIE	If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
L137525	u4546	m300	GABE	Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
L137516	u4546	m300	GABE	I don't know.  I don't know.
L137515	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
L137514	u4546	m300	GABE	We were going together before I ever let go of you.
L137513	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Thanks for holding on.
L137512	u4546	m300	GABE	Do it, goddammit!
L137511	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Don't let me fall!
L137510	u4546	m300	GABE	Reach up!  Do it!
L137507	u4546	m300	GABE	Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
L137506	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe!
L137503	u4546	m300	GABE	Jess, c'mon...
L137502	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
L137497	u4546	m300	GABE	Helluva time for vanity!
L137496	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
L137495	u4546	m300	GABE	Never, what?!
L137494	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Never
L137493	u4546	m300	GABE	These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
L137492	u4548	m300	JESSIE	This rope is sixty years old!
L137491	u4546	m300	GABE	Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
L137490	u4548	m300	JESSIE	What?
L137489	u4546	m300	GABE	Pull it apart!
L137485	u4546	m300	GABE	Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
L137484	u4548	m300	JESSIE	We might be able to go that way.
L137475	u4546	m300	GABE	We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
L137474	u4548	m300	JESSIE	They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
L137470	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Get it!
L137469	u4546	m300	GABE	She's a lyin' bitch!!
L137464	u4546	m300	GABE	Next time, date only basketball players.
L137463	u4548	m300	JESSIE	No luck?
L137431	u4546	m300	GABE	For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
L137430	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe are you alright?
L137429	u4546	m300	GABE	Up ahead.
L137428	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Can you see light?
L137426	u4546	m300	GABE	No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
L137425	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe!  Are you alright?
L137421	u4548	m300	JESSIE	If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
L137420	u4546	m300	GABE	What was God thinking when he built this place?
L137416	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Breathtaking.
L137415	u4546	m300	GABE	Nice view, huh?
L137408	u4546	m300	GABE	Cute.
L137407	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Want me to lead?
L137406	u4546	m300	GABE	A simple yes or no would have done.
L137405	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
L137404	u4546	m300	GABE	We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
L137372	u4546	m300	GABE	Sure, just give it back when you're done.
L137371	u4548	m300	JESSIE	If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
L137370	u4546	m300	GABE	Yeah?
L137369	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe...your arm?
L137368	u4546	m300	GABE	I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
L137367	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
L137366	u4548	m300	JESSIE	No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
L137365	u4546	m300	GABE	Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
L137364	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
L137363	u4546	m300	GABE	You attacked me.
L137362	u4548	m300	JESSIE	It was great.
L137361	u4546	m300	GABE	Of course I do.
L137360	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Remember the first time we came up here?
L137359	u4546	m300	GABE	Call me sentimental.
L137358	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
L137357	u4546	m300	GABE	Making things real rough for Hal.
L137356	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
L137355	u4546	m300	GABE	I can't believe you just said that.
L137354	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
L137353	u4546	m300	GABE	Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
L137336	u4546	m300	GABE	Don't worry about me, just go.
L137335	u4548	m300	JESSIE	What about you?
L137334	u4546	m300	GABE	Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
L137331	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You know me, I'm a night person.
L137330	u4546	m300	GABE	They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
L137323	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Excuse me?
L137322	u4546	m300	GABE	Let's be creative.
L137315	u4546	m300	GABE	Yeah, let's go.
L137314	u4548	m300	JESSIE	For the same reason you did, to help.
L137313	u4546	m300	GABE	That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
L137312	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
L137311	u4546	m300	GABE	Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
L137309	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Where's Hal, what's going on?
L137308	u4546	m300	GABE	You got to go back now!
L137307	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
L137306	u4546	m300	GABE	How'd you get up here?
L137305	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
L137304	u4546	m300	GABE	What are you doing here!?
L137303	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe!?
L137182	u4546	m300	GABE	I only came back for you.
L137181	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
L137180	u4546	m300	GABE	Can't do it.
L137179	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
L137178	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You mean the nerve.
L137177	u4546	m300	GABE	I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
L137176	u4548	m300	JESSIE	What if he can't?
L137175	u4546	m300	GABE	He can handle it.
L137174	u4548	m300	JESSIE	That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
L137173	u4546	m300	GABE	He doesn't want my help.
L137172	u4548	m300	JESSIE	If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
L137171	u4546	m300	GABE	Hal knows what he's doing.
L137170	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
L137087	u4546	m300	GABE	Jess--you look good.
L137086	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
L137085	u4546	m300	GABE	If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
L137084	u4548	m300	JESSIE	And I can't leave.
L137083	u4546	m300	GABE	Like I said, I can't turn it off.
L137082	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
L137081	u4546	m300	GABE	It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
L137080	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Where?
L137079	u4546	m300	GABE	I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
L137078	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
L137077	u4546	m300	GABE	No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
L137076	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
L137075	u4546	m300	GABE	From one professional to another, of course.
L137074	u4548	m300	JESSIE	"Listen to you...  The old ""mouth-to-mouth"" resuscitation routine, huh?"
L137073	u4546	m300	GABE	Flare up of old emotions...
L137072	u4548	m300	JESSIE	A flare up...
L137071	u4546	m300	GABE	Maybe lead to a flare up...
L137070	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Which could maybe what?
L137069	u4546	m300	GABE	--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
L137068	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Resuscitation?
L137067	u4546	m300	GABE	Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
L137066	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
L137065	u4546	m300	GABE	Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
L137064	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Did I miss something?
L137063	u4546	m300	GABE	Why are you yelling?
L137062	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Excuse me?
L137061	u4546	m300	GABE	Why are you yelling?
L137060	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
L137059	u4546	m300	GABE	You couldn't.
L137058	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I don't understand?
L137057	u4546	m300	GABE	I don't expect you to understand.
L137056	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
L137055	u4546	m300	GABE	I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
L137054	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
L137053	u4546	m300	GABE	Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
L137052	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
L137051	u4546	m300	GABE	I don't think you do.
L137050	u4548	m300	JESSIE	I know...
L137049	u4546	m300	GABE	A lot of things fell apart up there.
L137048	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
L137047	u4546	m300	GABE	After the funeral I just had to leave.
L137046	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
L137045	u4546	m300	GABE	Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
L137044	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Where've you been?
L137043	u4546	m300	GABE	When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
L137042	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Hello, Gabriel.
L136969	u4546	m300	GABE	On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
L136968	u4548	m300	JESSIE	The winds are picking up.
L136944	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
L136943	u4546	m300	GABE	And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
L136942	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Oh, please.
L136941	u4546	m300	GABE	Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
L136940	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Enough.
L136939	u4546	m300	GABE	We spent a night there one night...
L136938	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You can stop right there.
L136937	u4546	m300	GABE	The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
L136936	u4548	m300	JESSIE	He knows it well.
L136932	u4546	m300	GABE	Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
L136931	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
L136930	u4546	m300	GABE	Just hangin' out.
L136929	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
L136927	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
L136926	u4546	m300	GABE	That's a virtue isn't it?
L136925	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Patience my love, patience.
L136924	u4546	m300	GABE	Do you see them yet?
L137440	u4549	m300	KYNETTE	Now you get burned.
L137439	u4546	m300	GABE	Never could save a thing.
L137438	u4549	m300	KYNETTE	What the fuck you mean you burned it?
L137437	u4546	m300	GABE	I burned it.
L137436	u4549	m300	KYNETTE	Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
L137435	u4546	m300	GABE	Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
L137434	u4549	m300	KYNETTE	Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
L137629	u4547	m300	HAL	What are you talking about?
L137628	u4551	m300	QUALEN	No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
L137627	u4547	m300	HAL	Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
L137626	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
L137533	u4547	m300	HAL	When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
L137532	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Travers, you're not running things.
L137524	u4551	m300	QUALEN	I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
L137523	u4547	m300	HAL	He never hurt anybody.
L137410	u4547	m300	HAL	There is.
L137409	u4551	m300	QUALEN	You said there was a way across.
L137400	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
L137399	u4547	m300	HAL	Murdering, motherfucker...
L137391	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Sue me.
L137390	u4547	m300	HAL	You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
L137383	u4551	m300	QUALEN	We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
L137382	u4547	m300	HAL	For Christ's sake, they're kids.
L137377	u4551	m300	QUALEN	How far?
L137376	u4547	m300	HAL	It's up there, on the Tower.
L137352	u4551	m300	QUALEN	No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
L137351	u4547	m300	HAL	No, he's gone.
L137350	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
L137293	u4547	m300	HAL	The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
L137292	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
L137278	u4547	m300	HAL	Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
L137277	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
L137264	u4547	m300	HAL	The best he can since you gave him nothing.
L137263	u4551	m300	QUALEN	What's he doing?
L137260	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
L137259	u4547	m300	HAL	He'll freeze.
L137251	u4547	m300	HAL	Right, all the bullets we can eat.
L137250	u4551	m300	QUALEN	The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
L137228	u4547	m300	HAL	What the hell's going on?
L137227	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Where's the helicopter?
L137412	u4547	m300	HAL	There.  You blind?
L137411	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Then where the fuck is!
L137379	u4547	m300	HAL	Half a day.
L137378	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
L137291	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	It looks like a winding route.
L137290	u4547	m300	HAL	On top of the peak.
L137282	u4547	m300	HAL	The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
L137281	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Have her come up.
L137239	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
L137238	u4547	m300	HAL	Tucker and Walker.
L137237	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	What's your names?
L137236	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Anyone else following?
L137235	u4547	m300	HAL	Yeah...
L137670	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Then it's a deal.
L137669	u4547	m300	HAL	Right.
L137655	u4547	m300	HAL	Climb, Gabe, climb!
L137654	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Oh, my God!
L137280	u4547	m300	HAL	<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
L137279	u4548	m300	JESSIE	You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
L137169	u4547	m300	HAL	Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
L137168	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Where's the rest of the team?
L137167	u4547	m300	HAL	You're looking at him.
L137166	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Who's going with you?
L137165	u4547	m300	HAL	You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
L137161	u4547	m300	HAL	Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
L137160	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Got to be Comb Bluff.
L136993	u4547	m300	HAL	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
L136992	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Go after her.
L136958	u4548	m300	JESSIE	Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
L136957	u4547	m300	HAL	Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
L137101	u4550	m300	MATHESON	What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
L137100	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
L137099	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
L137098	u4550	m300	MATHESON	Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
L137097	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	What the hell are you doing--
L137025	u4550	m300	MATHESON	Do you always transport through the air?
L137024	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
L137023	u4550	m300	MATHESON	I don't know about totally.
L137602	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Get off the radio!
L137601	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
L137600	u4551	m300	QUALEN	No names, this is an open line!
L137599	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
L137598	u4551	m300	QUALEN	You got what we need?
L137537	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Give me the fucking code!
L137536	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
L137535	u4551	m300	QUALEN	What's the code, Travers?
L137487	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
L137486	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
L137479	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
L137478	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Is it set?
L137414	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
L137413	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
L137398	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
L137397	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
L137375	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
L137374	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
L137328	u4551	m300	QUALEN	He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
L137327	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	He's alive!
L137325	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Then go fetch.
L137324	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	This way.
L137319	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
L137318	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	What about it?
L137317	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Man against nature, right Travers.
L137273	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	We can't and he knows it.
L137272	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
L137267	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Kill him when he gets down.
L137266	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	I don't trust him.
L137258	u4551	m300	QUALEN	We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
L137257	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Don't give him anything.
L137249	u4551	m300	QUALEN	I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
L137248	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Get off my back, Qualen!
L137245	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	There, what's that place?
L137244	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Where's the third one, Travers?
L137234	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	You're both with the mountain rescue team?
L137233	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Ask the questions.
L137232	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Don't use my name!
L137139	u4551	m300	QUALEN	The monitor! I never ask twice.
L137138	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Why?  What are you going to do?!
L137137	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
L137136	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
L137117	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Let's move your ass in there!!
L137116	u4551	m300	QUALEN	What's the delay?
L137114	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
L137113	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Why didn't you send the money over?
L137110	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
L137109	u4551	m300	QUALEN	Travers!  Hurry it up.
L137029	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
L137028	u4554	m300	WRIGHT	I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
L137027	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
L137026	u4554	m300	WRIGHT	Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
L137022	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
L137021	u4554	m300	WRIGHT	Appreciate it.
L137020	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
L137019	u4554	m300	WRIGHT	Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
L137018	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Richard Travers.
L137017	u4554	m300	WRIGHT	I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
L137016	u4553	m300	TRAVERS	Good morning, Walt.
L137015	u4554	m300	WRIGHT	Rich...
L173879	u4921	m328	BARON	You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
L173878	u4930	m328	PITER	The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
L173877	u4921	m328	BARON	It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
L173682	u4921	m328	BARON	I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
L173681	u4930	m328	PITER	He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
L173680	u4921	m328	BARON	What does Leto say, Piter?
L173679	u4930	m328	PITER	The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
L173678	u4921	m328	BARON	Piter.
L173677	u4930	m328	PITER	My Lord!
L173811	u4926	m328	KYNES	Nothing.
L173810	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	What's that you're saying?
L173792	u4926	m328	KYNES	The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
L173791	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	What happens now?
L173765	u4926	m328	KYNES	With your permission...
L173764	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	My thanks.
L173754	u4926	m328	KYNES	They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
L173753	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
L173749	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	This is my son, Paul.
L173748	u4926	m328	KYNES	I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
L173747	u4922	m328	DUKE LETO	So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
L173540	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	We are alone...
L173539	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Yes, my Lord.
L173536	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
L173535	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
L173534	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
L173533	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes?
L173532	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
L173531	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
L173530	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	We felt his presence.
L173529	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
L173561	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
L173560	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	I can assure you...
L173557	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
L173556	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
L173552	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes.
L173551	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
L173550	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
L173549	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes.
L173548	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
L173544	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
L173543	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	Many machines on Ix... new machines.
L173542	u4923	m328	EMPEROR	Yes?... How was your journey?
L173541	u4928	m328	NAVIGATOR	We have just folded space from Ix...
L173784	u4926	m328	KYNES	That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
L173783	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
L173762	u4926	m328	KYNES	It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
L173761	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Yes, Sire.
L173759	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Sire!
L173758	u4926	m328	KYNES	Basically...
L173757	u4924	m328	GURNEY	The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
L173745	u4926	m328	KYNES	Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
L173744	u4924	m328	GURNEY	"I hope I made myself clear. You may call him ""The Duke,"" ""My lord,"" or ""Sire."" And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- ""Noble Born."""
L173743	u4926	m328	KYNES	So, this is Leto the Just...
L174130	u4929	m328	PAUL	The Emperor's blade.
L174129	u4924	m328	GURNEY	This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
L174102	u4929	m328	PAUL	Let him stand free!
L174101	u4924	m328	GURNEY	My Lord?
L174100	u4929	m328	PAUL	Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
L174043	u4924	m328	GURNEY	They said you were dead.  They said...
L174042	u4929	m328	PAUL	Don't you trust your own eyes.
L174041	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Paul!!  Paul!!
L174040	u4929	m328	PAUL	You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
L173590	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
L173589	u4929	m328	PAUL	Things have been so serious here lately.
L173588	u4924	m328	GURNEY	If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
L173587	u4929	m328	PAUL	Would you really have drawn my blood?
L173586	u4924	m328	GURNEY	"We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the ""mood""."
L173585	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
L173584	u4929	m328	PAUL	Is this what you seek?
L173583	u4929	m328	PAUL	What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
L173581	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Not sorry enough.
L173580	u4929	m328	PAUL	I'm sorry Gurney.
L173579	u4924	m328	GURNEY	Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
L173578	u4929	m328	PAUL	Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
L173577	u4924	m328	GURNEY	No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
L173972	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
L173971	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
L173970	u4925	m328	JESSICA	They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
L173969	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
L173941	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
L173940	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
L173939	u4932	m328	STILGAR	I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
L173938	u4925	m328	JESSICA	No, but many consider my training valuable.
L173937	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
L173936	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
L173738	u4927	m328	MAPES	My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
L173737	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
L173736	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
L173735	u4927	m328	MAPES	Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
L173734	u4925	m328	JESSICA	It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
L173733	u4927	m328	MAPES	Do you know this my lady?
L173730	u4925	m328	JESSICA	That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
L173729	u4927	m328	MAPES	As the legend says.
L173728	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
L173727	u4927	m328	MAPES	You know the ancient tongues?
L174120	u4929	m328	PAUL	You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
L174119	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Stop him yourself.
L173935	u4929	m328	PAUL	Yes...
L173934	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Man-carved steps.
L173933	u4929	m328	PAUL	Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
L173932	u4925	m328	JESSICA	What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
L173929	u4929	m328	PAUL	I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
L173928	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Yes...
L173927	u4929	m328	PAUL	Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
L173925	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I can't... I can't.
L173924	u4929	m328	PAUL	Run!
L173921	u4925	m328	JESSICA	I'm ready.
L173920	u4929	m328	PAUL	Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
L173919	u4925	m328	JESSICA	 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
L173918	u4929	m328	PAUL	It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
L173910	u4929	m328	PAUL	You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
L173909	u4925	m328	JESSICA	He knows.
L173908	u4929	m328	PAUL	You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
L173907	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Is he....?
L173906	u4929	m328	PAUL	The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
L173905	u4929	m328	PAUL	Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
L173898	u4929	m328	PAUL	 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
L173897	u4925	m328	JESSICA	A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
L173893	u4929	m328	PAUL	The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
L173892	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Where are we do you think?
L173891	u4929	m328	PAUL	I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
L173869	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Excellent!
L173868	u4929	m328	PAUL	Remove her gag!
L173862	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
L173861	u4929	m328	PAUL	Don't touch my mother...
L173637	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
L173636	u4929	m328	PAUL	What does she fear?  What about my Father?
L173635	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Your Reverence.
L173634	u4925	m328	JESSICA	Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
L173815	u4926	m328	KYNES	You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
L173814	u4929	m328	PAUL	Liet?
L173809	u4926	m328	KYNES	Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
L173808	u4929	m328	PAUL	Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
L173780	u4926	m328	KYNES	To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
L173779	u4929	m328	PAUL	Why do they come?
L173778	u4926	m328	KYNES	Always.
L173777	u4929	m328	PAUL	Always?
L173776	u4926	m328	KYNES	Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
L173775	u4929	m328	PAUL	Will we see a worm?
L173770	u4926	m328	KYNES	That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
L173769	u4929	m328	PAUL	No one. It... seemed the proper way.
L173768	u4926	m328	KYNES	Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
L173767	u4929	m328	PAUL	No.
L173766	u4926	m328	KYNES	You've worn a stillsuit before?
L173752	u4929	m328	PAUL	He's hiding something.
L173751	u4926	m328	KYNES	I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
L173750	u4929	m328	PAUL	Are you a Fremen?
L174076	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Long live the fighters!
L174075	u4929	m328	PAUL	Long live the fighters!
L174038	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
L174037	u4929	m328	PAUL	We surprised a band of smugglers.
L174020	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
L174019	u4929	m328	PAUL	My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
L173977	u4929	m328	PAUL	The most lethal poison in the Universe.
L173976	u4932	m328	STILGAR	The Water of Life.
L173956	u4932	m328	STILGAR	Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
L173955	u4929	m328	PAUL	Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
L173950	u4932	m328	STILGAR	You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
L173949	u4929	m328	PAUL	Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
L173948	u4932	m328	STILGAR	We call that one Muad'dib.
L173947	u4929	m328	PAUL	What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
L173946	u4932	m328	STILGAR	You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
L174122	u4929	m328	PAUL	SILENCE!
L174121	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	You mustn't speak of...
L174118	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Stop him, Jessica!
L174117	u4929	m328	PAUL	Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
L173980	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	They tried and died.
L173979	u4929	m328	PAUL	Did they try and fail?
L173978	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	... Many men have tried.
L173675	u4929	m328	PAUL	MOTHER! Tell me!
L173674	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	What can be done has been done.
L173673	u4929	m328	PAUL	Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
L173671	u4929	m328	PAUL	I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
L173670	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
L173669	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	They tried and died....  Jessica!
L173668	u4929	m328	PAUL	Did they try and fail?
L173667	u4929	m328	PAUL	I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
L173666	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
L173665	u4929	m328	PAUL	Where?
L173664	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
L173663	u4929	m328	PAUL	What is it?
L173662	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
L173661	u4929	m328	PAUL	Not all of them... I know which ones will.
L173660	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
L173657	u4929	m328	PAUL	I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
L173656	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
L173655	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
L173654	u4929	m328	PAUL	THE PAIN!
L173652	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	You feel the flesh crisping?
L173651	u4929	m328	PAUL	 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
L173650	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	SILENCE... SILENCE.
L173649	u4929	m328	PAUL	It burns.
L173648	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
L173647	u4929	m328	PAUL	Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
L173646	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
L173645	u4929	m328	PAUL	The Voice again.
L173643	u4931	m328	REVEREND MOTHER	Pain.
L173642	u4929	m328	PAUL	What's in the box?
L173603	u4933	m328	THUFIR	We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
L173602	u4929	m328	PAUL	I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
L173601	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
L173600	u4929	m328	PAUL	The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
L173599	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
L173576	u4929	m328	PAUL	My father sent you to test me. Music then?
L173575	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
L173574	u4929	m328	PAUL	I'd know the difference.
L173573	u4933	m328	THUFIR	Those sounds could be imitated.
L173572	u4929	m328	PAUL	I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
L191966	u5104	m337	VADER	And code the signal to my private chamber.
L191965	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	Yes, My Lord.
L191964	u5104	m337	VADER	Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
L191963	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
L191962	u5104	m337	VADER	The Emperor?
L191961	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	It was .... the Emperor ....
L192205	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
L192204	u5104	m337	VADER	Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
L192203	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
L191932	u5104	m337	VADER	Yes, Admiral .... soon.
L191931	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Soon, Lord Vader.
L191930	u5104	m337	VADER	Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
L191929	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
L191928	u5104	m337	VADER	Come in, Admiral.
L191927	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	My lord.
L192357	u5105	m337	YODA	No ... there is another.
L192356	u5092	m337	BEN	The boy is our last hope.
L192355	u5105	m337	YODA	Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
L192353	u5105	m337	YODA	Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
L192352	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
L192345	u5092	m337	BEN	You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
L192344	u5105	m337	YODA	Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
L192086	u5092	m337	BEN	We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
L192085	u5105	m337	YODA	Will he finish what he begins?
L192083	u5105	m337	YODA	He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
L192082	u5092	m337	BEN	He'll learn.
L192079	u5105	m337	YODA	This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
L192078	u5092	m337	BEN	He can do it.
L192073	u5092	m337	BEN	We've discussed this before.
L192072	u5105	m337	YODA	Much anger in him, like in his father.
L192071	u5092	m337	BEN	He will learn patience.
L192343	u5092	m337	BEN	Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
L192342	u5100	m337	LUKE	You won't.
L192341	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
L192340	u5100	m337	LUKE	And that is why I must go.
L192339	u5092	m337	BEN	Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
L192336	u5092	m337	BEN	But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
L192335	u5100	m337	LUKE	I feel The Force.
L192334	u5092	m337	BEN	You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
L192333	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can help them!
L192332	u5092	m337	BEN	You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
L192331	u5100	m337	LUKE	But Han and Leia will surely die.
L192330	u5092	m337	BEN	... Luke, you must not go.
L191662	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke ... you are the only hope.
L191661	u5100	m337	LUKE	Ben ... Ben ...
L191660	u5092	m337	BEN	You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
L191659	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm cold ... so cold ...
L191658	u5092	m337	BEN	You must survive, Luke.
L191657	u5092	m337	BEN	You must.  Luke, look at me!
L191656	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can't ...
L192541	u5098	m337	LANDO	We're not out of this yet.
L192540	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
L192531	u5098	m337	LANDO	Okay, okay.
L192530	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
L192527	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
L192526	u5098	m337	LANDO	Three patrol ships are heading our way.
L192440	u5098	m337	LANDO	What's wrong with him?
L192439	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks a blue streak.
L192315	u5098	m337	LANDO	Everyone's invited, of course.
L192314	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
L192258	u5098	m337	LANDO	Right.
L192257	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Growls a reserved greeting.
L192256	u5098	m337	LANDO	How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
L192415	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
L192414	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks a doleful farewell.
L192376	u5097	m337	HAN	No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
L192375	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his concern.
L192324	u5097	m337	HAN	Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
L192323	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at Han.
L192306	u5097	m337	HAN	Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
L192305	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
L192243	u5097	m337	HAN	That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
L192242	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks and growls at his boss.
L192241	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, it's been awhile.
L192549	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
L192548	u5099	m337	LEIA	Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
L192525	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
L192524	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his consternation.
L192482	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
L192481	u5099	m337	LEIA	... the power?
L192476	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his ?right on!
L192475	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
L192472	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
L192471	u5099	m337	LEIA	We should have stayed and finished them off.
L192300	u5099	m337	LEIA	What happened?
L192299	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at his master.
L192068	u5100	m337	LUKE	How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
L192067	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
L192066	u5100	m337	LUKE	Because of my father, I guess.
L192065	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
L192064	u5100	m337	LUKE	Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
L192063	u5094	m337	CREATURE	It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
L192062	u5100	m337	LUKE	Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
L192061	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Patience.  It's time to eat.
L192060	u5100	m337	LUKE	... I told you, I'm not hungry.
L192019	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
L192018	u5100	m337	LUKE	You know the Jedi Master?
L192017	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
L192016	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
L192015	u5094	m337	CREATURE	No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
L192014	u5100	m337	LUKE	Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
L192013	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mine, mine.
L192010	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
L192009	u5100	m337	LUKE	I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
L192008	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
L192007	u5100	m337	LUKE	Give me that!
L192006	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
L192005	u5100	m337	LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
L192001	u5094	m337	CREATURE	A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
L192000	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm looking for a great warrior.
L191999	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
L191998	u5100	m337	LUKE	Yeah ...
L191997	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
L191996	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
L191995	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
L191994	u5100	m337	LUKE	... Like we're being watched.
L191655	u5097	m337	HAN	Then I'll see you in Hell.
L191654	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
L191653	u5097	m337	HAN	You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
L191652	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	The temperature is dropping too fast.
L191651	u5097	m337	HAN	We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
L191650	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
L191649	u5097	m337	HAN	Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
L191648	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
L191642	u5097	m337	HAN	Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
L191641	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
L191640	u5097	m337	HAN	Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
L191639	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	Yes sir!
L192100	u5104	m337	VADER	He will join us or die, My Master.
L192099	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
L192098	u5104	m337	VADER	But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
L192097	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
L192096	u5104	m337	VADER	He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
L192095	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
L192094	u5104	m337	VADER	Our destruction?  Who?
L192093	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
L192092	u5104	m337	VADER	I have felt it.
L192091	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
L192090	u5104	m337	VADER	What is thy bidding, My Master?
L191711	u5097	m337	HAN	Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
L191710	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
L191709	u5097	m337	HAN	Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
L191603	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
L191602	u5097	m337	HAN	Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
L191601	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
L191600	u5097	m337	HAN	That's right.
L191598	u5097	m337	HAN	The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
L191597	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
L191596	u5097	m337	HAN	He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
L191595	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Good, and Commander Skywalker?
L191594	u5097	m337	HAN	There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
L191593	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
L192157	u5097	m337	HAN	Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
L192156	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
L192126	u5097	m337	HAN	Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
L192125	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
L192106	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm going to see what it is.
L192105	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	It sounds like it's trying to get in.
L191988	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
L191987	u5097	m337	HAN	You, too, golden rod.
L191969	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
L191968	u5097	m337	HAN	What are you so grouchy about?
L191907	u5097	m337	HAN	We're in trouble!
L191906	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
L191905	u5097	m337	HAN	I think we're in trouble.
L191897	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	It can wait.
L191896	u5097	m337	HAN	Sit down, and shut up!
L191895	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, I was wondering ...
L191857	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
L191856	u5097	m337	HAN	Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
L191686	u5097	m337	HAN	The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
L191685	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
L191684	u5097	m337	HAN	He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
L191644	u5097	m337	HAN	Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
L191643	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
L191636	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
L191635	u5097	m337	HAN	I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
L191634	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
L191633	u5097	m337	HAN	What is it?
L191632	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
L192417	u5097	m337	HAN	... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
L192416	u5099	m337	LEIA	... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
L192379	u5097	m337	HAN	Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
L192378	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
L192377	u5097	m337	HAN	I was worried about you.
L192308	u5097	m337	HAN	Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
L192307	u5099	m337	LEIA	No thanks.
L192304	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
L192303	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
L192302	u5099	m337	LEIA	Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
L192301	u5097	m337	HAN	He found him in a junk pile ...
L192298	u5097	m337	HAN	Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
L192297	u5099	m337	LEIA	I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
L192296	u5097	m337	HAN	Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
L192295	u5099	m337	LEIA	Has Threepio turned up yet?
L192294	u5097	m337	HAN	You look great.
L192293	u5099	m337	LEIA	You look silly.
L192292	u5097	m337	HAN	Who's staring?
L192291	u5099	m337	LEIA	What are you staring at?
L192250	u5097	m337	HAN	It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
L192249	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't like this.
L192228	u5097	m337	HAN	Let er go, Chewie.
L192227	u5099	m337	LEIA	You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
L192225	u5097	m337	HAN	No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
L192224	u5099	m337	LEIA	Can you trust him?
L192223	u5097	m337	HAN	A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
L192222	u5099	m337	LEIA	A mining colony.
L192221	u5097	m337	HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
L192220	u5099	m337	LEIA	Never heard of that system.
L192219	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
L192218	u5099	m337	LEIA	You keep logs?  My, how organized.
L192217	u5097	m337	HAN	Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
L192216	u5097	m337	HAN	Here ... near the Anoat system.
L192215	u5099	m337	LEIA	That depends.  Where are we?
L192214	u5097	m337	HAN	Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
L192213	u5099	m337	LEIA	Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
L192212	u5097	m337	HAN	The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
L192211	u5099	m337	LEIA	What'd you have in mind for your next move?
L192210	u5097	m337	HAN	Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
L192209	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
L192208	u5097	m337	HAN	Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
L192207	u5099	m337	LEIA	You could have warned him before you shut him off.
L192166	u5099	m337	LEIA	You're going to attack them?!!!
L192165	u5097	m337	HAN	Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
L192162	u5097	m337	HAN	It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
L192161	u5099	m337	LEIA	No lightspeed?
L192160	u5097	m337	HAN	Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
L192124	u5099	m337	LEIA	The entrance is collapsing!
L192123	u5097	m337	HAN	I see it Chewie, hang on.
L192122	u5099	m337	LEIA	But the tremors have stopped.
L192121	u5097	m337	HAN	Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
L192120	u5099	m337	LEIA	Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
L192112	u5097	m337	HAN	There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
L192111	u5099	m337	LEIA	Looks like some kind of Mynock.
L192108	u5097	m337	HAN	Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
L192107	u5099	m337	LEIA	Are you crazy!
L192104	u5099	m337	LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
L192103	u5097	m337	HAN	Where?
L192102	u5099	m337	LEIA	There's something out there!
L192057	u5097	m337	HAN	Try and control this ...
L192056	u5099	m337	LEIA	I do not!
L192055	u5097	m337	HAN	You mean a man you can control.
L192054	u5099	m337	LEIA	There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
L192053	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
L192052	u5099	m337	LEIA	Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
L192049	u5099	m337	LEIA	Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
L192048	u5097	m337	HAN	What are you afraid of?
L192046	u5097	m337	HAN	Why?
L192045	u5099	m337	LEIA	Stop that.
L192044	u5097	m337	HAN	That's quite a compliment.
L192043	u5099	m337	LEIA	Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
L192042	u5097	m337	HAN	You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
L192041	u5099	m337	LEIA	Yes, you do.
L192040	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
L192039	u5099	m337	LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
L192038	u5097	m337	HAN	Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
L192035	u5099	m337	LEIA	Where have I heard that before?
L192034	u5097	m337	HAN	They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
L192033	u5099	m337	LEIA	They're moving away.
L192031	u5099	m337	LEIA	Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
L192030	u5097	m337	HAN	That was no earthquake.
L191984	u5097	m337	HAN	Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
L191983	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
L191982	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, I hope you don't expect more.
L191981	u5099	m337	LEIA	Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
L191979	u5097	m337	HAN	Beautiful.
L191978	u5099	m337	LEIA	How do I look?
L191977	u5097	m337	HAN	You don't look angry.
L191976	u5099	m337	LEIA	Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
L191975	u5097	m337	HAN	Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
L191947	u5097	m337	HAN	That should do nicely.
L191946	u5099	m337	LEIA	What is it?
L191945	u5097	m337	HAN	There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
L191941	u5097	m337	HAN	Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
L191940	u5099	m337	LEIA	Now you're making sense.
L191939	u5097	m337	HAN	We've got to get out of this shower.
L191938	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm against that.
L191937	u5097	m337	HAN	But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
L191936	u5099	m337	LEIA	Good.
L191935	u5097	m337	HAN	That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
L191934	u5099	m337	LEIA	I take it back.
L191933	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
L191924	u5097	m337	HAN	Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
L191923	u5099	m337	LEIA	To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
L191922	u5097	m337	HAN	Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
L191921	u5099	m337	LEIA	Probably an asteroid field ....
L191920	u5097	m337	HAN	Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
L191919	u5099	m337	LEIA	Or you ran into something ....
L191918	u5097	m337	HAN	That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
L191894	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
L191893	u5097	m337	HAN	Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
L191892	u5097	m337	HAN	I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
L191874	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
L191873	u5097	m337	HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
L191872	u5099	m337	LEIA	This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
L191869	u5097	m337	HAN	Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
L191868	u5099	m337	LEIA	Would it help if I got out and pushed?
L191851	u5099	m337	LEIA	Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
L191850	u5097	m337	HAN	Hey!  Someone's still in here.
L191771	u5097	m337	HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
L191770	u5099	m337	LEIA	Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
L191769	u5097	m337	HAN	Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
L191768	u5099	m337	LEIA	You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
L191765	u5097	m337	HAN	Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
L191764	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't know what he's talking about.
L191759	u5099	m337	LEIA	I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
L191758	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
L191716	u5097	m337	HAN	Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
L191715	u5099	m337	LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
L191714	u5097	m337	HAN	Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
L191713	u5099	m337	LEIA	What was it?
L191712	u5097	m337	HAN	.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
L191691	u5097	m337	HAN	No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
L191690	u5099	m337	LEIA	Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
L191688	u5097	m337	HAN	Forget it.
L191687	u5099	m337	LEIA	Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
L191627	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
L191626	u5099	m337	LEIA	And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
L191625	u5097	m337	HAN	Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
L191624	u5099	m337	LEIA	We are fighting for a cause much ...
L191623	u5097	m337	HAN	There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
L191622	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
L191621	u5097	m337	HAN	Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
L191619	u5099	m337	LEIA	I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
L191618	u5097	m337	HAN	You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
L191617	u5099	m337	LEIA	And what are they, pray tell?
L191616	u5097	m337	HAN	You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
L191615	u5099	m337	LEIA	Me?  I don't know what you mean.
L191614	u5097	m337	HAN	Not you?
L191613	u5099	m337	LEIA	Yes.
L191612	u5097	m337	HAN	We?
L191611	u5099	m337	LEIA	Han, we need you here.
L191610	u5097	m337	HAN	He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
L191609	u5099	m337	LEIA	Does Luke know?
L191608	u5097	m337	HAN	That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
L191607	u5099	m337	LEIA	You said you were going to stay. What happened?
L191606	u5097	m337	HAN	Yes, Your Highness?
L191798	u5097	m337	HAN	Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
L191797	u5100	m337	LUKE	I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
L191767	u5097	m337	HAN	Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
L191766	u5100	m337	LUKE	About what?
L191761	u5097	m337	HAN	That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
L191760	u5100	m337	LUKE	Probe?  What probe?
L191757	u5097	m337	HAN	That's two you owe me, junior.
L191756	u5100	m337	LUKE	Thanks to you.
L191755	u5097	m337	HAN	Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
L191588	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
L191587	u5097	m337	HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
L191586	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
L191585	u5097	m337	HAN	Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
L192396	u5097	m337	HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
L192395	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
L192392	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
L192391	u5097	m337	HAN	All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
L192388	u5097	m337	HAN	Luke?  I don't get it.
L192387	u5098	m337	LANDO	He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
L192386	u5097	m337	HAN	You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
L192383	u5098	m337	LANDO	Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
L192382	u5097	m337	HAN	This ought to be good.
L192381	u5098	m337	LANDO	Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
L192380	u5097	m337	HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
L192327	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm sorry too.
L192326	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
L192272	u5097	m337	HAN	Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
L192271	u5098	m337	LANDO	Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
L192270	u5097	m337	HAN	How's your mining operation going?
L192269	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
L192268	u5097	m337	HAN	Hyperdrive.
L192267	u5098	m337	LANDO	That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
L192265	u5098	m337	LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
L192264	u5097	m337	HAN	Repairs ...
L192263	u5098	m337	LANDO	That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
L192255	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll bet.
L192254	u5097	m337	HAN	I always said you were a gentleman.
L192253	u5098	m337	LANDO	Are you kidding?
L192252	u5097	m337	HAN	No hard feelings?
L192251	u5098	m337	LANDO	Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
L192426	u5104	m337	VADER	I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
L192425	u5098	m337	LANDO	That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
L192424	u5104	m337	VADER	Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
L192423	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll take what's mine now.
L192403	u5104	m337	VADER	I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
L192402	u5098	m337	LANDO	We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
L192370	u5104	m337	VADER	Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
L192369	u5098	m337	LANDO	No.
L192368	u5104	m337	VADER	I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
L192367	u5098	m337	LANDO	That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
L192366	u5104	m337	VADER	You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
L192365	u5098	m337	LANDO	What about Leia and the Wookiee?
L192547	u5099	m337	LEIA	That sounds familiar.
L192546	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
L192543	u5099	m337	LEIA	Are the coordinates set?
L192542	u5098	m337	LANDO	The deflector shields are gone.
L192535	u5099	m337	LEIA	It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
L192534	u5098	m337	LANDO	Someone's falling.
L192529	u5098	m337	LANDO	Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
L192528	u5099	m337	LEIA	No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
L192523	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke needs help.  We must go back.
L192522	u5098	m337	LANDO	What?
L192521	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke!
L192520	u5098	m337	LANDO	I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
L192517	u5098	m337	LANDO	I didn't say anything?
L192516	u5099	m337	LEIA	What'd you say?
L192499	u5098	m337	LANDO	His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
L192498	u5099	m337	LEIA	We've got to find Luke.
L192489	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
L192488	u5099	m337	LEIA	You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
L192480	u5099	m337	LEIA	What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
L192479	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
L192478	u5099	m337	LEIA	You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
L192477	u5098	m337	LANDO	Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
L192446	u5098	m337	LANDO	There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
L192445	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
L192438	u5098	m337	LANDO	This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
L192437	u5099	m337	LEIA	We have no use for your kind.
L192436	u5098	m337	LANDO	Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
L192435	u5099	m337	LEIA	And when do you betray us again?
L192434	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
L192433	u5099	m337	LEIA	What's going on?
L192390	u5099	m337	LEIA	... we're the bait.
L192389	u5098	m337	LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
L192385	u5098	m337	LANDO	I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
L192384	u5099	m337	LEIA	What about Han?
L192322	u5098	m337	LANDO	Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
L192321	u5099	m337	LEIA	It's a lovely outpost.
L192320	u5098	m337	LANDO	Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
L192319	u5099	m337	LEIA	You're part of the mining guild then?
L192318	u5098	m337	LANDO	.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
L192313	u5098	m337	LANDO	Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
L192312	u5099	m337	LEIA	Thanks.
L192311	u5098	m337	LANDO	I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
L192310	u5099	m337	LEIA	Not really.
L192309	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
L192260	u5099	m337	LEIA	You may call me Leia.
L192259	u5098	m337	LANDO	Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
L191823	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
L191822	u5099	m337	LEIA	Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
L191702	u5099	m337	LEIA	What is it?
L191701	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
L191695	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Not yet.  They're working on it now.
L191694	u5099	m337	LEIA	Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
L191677	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
L191676	u5099	m337	LEIA	Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
L191675	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
L191674	u5099	m337	LEIA	I understand.
L191673	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
L192514	u5099	m337	LEIA	Let's go.
L192513	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
L192240	u5099	m337	LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
L192239	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Rather touchy, aren't they.
L192164	u5099	m337	LEIA	Well, what now?
L192163	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
L192128	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Oh my, no!
L192127	u5099	m337	LEIA	What??
L191972	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
L191971	u5099	m337	LEIA	A tremor!
L191943	u5099	m337	LEIA	Closer?!
L191942	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Closer?!
L191926	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
L191925	u5099	m337	LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
L191739	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'll be back later.
L191738	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
L191737	u5099	m337	LEIA	You rest now.
L192545	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've never seen it fail.
L192544	u5099	m337	LEIA	This hyperdrive had better work.
L192539	u5100	m337	LUKE	He'll survive.
L192538	u5099	m337	LEIA	Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
L192428	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke, no!  It's a trap.
L192427	u5100	m337	LUKE	Leia!
L191752	u5100	m337	LUKE	Snow creatures ... they're here?!
L191751	u5099	m337	LEIA	I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
L191750	u5100	m337	LUKE	Jabba the Hutt?
L191749	u5099	m337	LEIA	He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
L191748	u5100	m337	LUKE	Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
L191747	u5100	m337	LUKE	Han's leaving?
L191746	u5099	m337	LEIA	First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
L191745	u5100	m337	LUKE	What are you talking about?
L191744	u5099	m337	LEIA	That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
L191743	u5100	m337	LUKE	I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
L191742	u5099	m337	LEIA	Where are you going?
L191741	u5099	m337	LEIA	What did you say?!
L191740	u5100	m337	LUKE	Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
L191731	u5099	m337	LEIA	Me too.  I was afraid.
L191730	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
L191729	u5099	m337	LEIA	The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
L192347	u5105	m337	YODA	If it must be.  Yes.
L192346	u5100	m337	LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
L192338	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
L192337	u5105	m337	YODA	Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
L192290	u5105	m337	YODA	Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
L192289	u5100	m337	LUKE	They're my friends.
L192288	u5105	m337	YODA	Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
L192287	u5100	m337	LUKE	Will they die?
L192286	u5105	m337	YODA	It is the future you see.
L192285	u5100	m337	LUKE	I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
L192284	u5105	m337	YODA	Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
L192283	u5100	m337	LUKE	I see a city in the clouds.
L192282	u5105	m337	YODA	Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
L192281	u5100	m337	LUKE	My mind fills with so many images.
L192280	u5105	m337	YODA	Free your mind and return he will.
L192279	u5100	m337	LUKE	Ben?  Ben?
L192235	u5105	m337	YODA	Only what you take with you.
L192234	u5100	m337	LUKE	What's in there?
L192233	u5105	m337	YODA	This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
L192232	u5100	m337	LUKE	I feel cold.
L192230	u5100	m337	LUKE	Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
L192229	u5105	m337	YODA	Four this time!  The Force you feel.
L192199	u5105	m337	YODA	No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
L192198	u5100	m337	LUKE	But tell me why ...
L192197	u5105	m337	YODA	You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
L192196	u5100	m337	LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
L192195	u5105	m337	YODA	No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
L192194	u5100	m337	LUKE	Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
L192193	u5105	m337	YODA	The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
L192192	u5100	m337	LUKE	Price?  What do you mean?
L192191	u5105	m337	YODA	Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
L192190	u5100	m337	LUKE	But I feel The Force flowing!
L192189	u5105	m337	YODA	No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
L192187	u5105	m337	YODA	That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
L192186	u5100	m337	LUKE	They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
L192185	u5105	m337	YODA	That they are.
L192184	u5100	m337	LUKE	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
L192183	u5105	m337	YODA	Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
L192151	u5105	m337	YODA	That is why you fail.
L192150	u5100	m337	LUKE	I don't believe it.
L192147	u5105	m337	YODA	Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
L192146	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
L192145	u5105	m337	YODA	No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
L192144	u5100	m337	LUKE	Okay.  I'll give it a try.
L192143	u5105	m337	YODA	No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
L192142	u5100	m337	LUKE	Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
L192134	u5105	m337	YODA	Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
L192133	u5100	m337	LUKE	I thought I was in good shape.
L192132	u5105	m337	YODA	It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
L192088	u5105	m337	YODA	You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
L192087	u5100	m337	LUKE	I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
L192081	u5105	m337	YODA	You are reckless!
L192080	u5100	m337	LUKE	I have followed my feelings.
L192077	u5105	m337	YODA	To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
L192076	u5100	m337	LUKE	Why not me?
L192075	u5105	m337	YODA	Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
L192508	u5100	m337	LUKE	Never.
L192507	u5104	m337	VADER	There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
L192506	u5100	m337	LUKE	No! .... Never ....
L192505	u5104	m337	VADER	The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
L192458	u5100	m337	LUKE	Time will tell.
L192457	u5104	m337	VADER	All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
L192456	u5104	m337	VADER	That won't be necessary.
L192455	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'll die first.
L192454	u5104	m337	VADER	There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
L192453	u5100	m337	LUKE	No!
L192452	u5104	m337	VADER	Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
L192451	u5104	m337	VADER	And I too.
L192450	u5100	m337	LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
L192449	u5104	m337	VADER	The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
L191889	u5104	m337	VADER	I want that ship.
L191888	u5101	m337	PIETT	It won't get through the blockade.
L191887	u5104	m337	VADER	Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
L191886	u5101	m337	PIETT	Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
L191782	u5104	m337	VADER	Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
L191781	u5101	m337	PIETT	Yes, My Lord.
L191723	u5101	m337	PIETT	Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
L191722	u5104	m337	VADER	The Hoth System?
L194034	u5116	m339	MALLOY	C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
L194033	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
L193646	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
L193645	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	His reactor's starting to overheat.
L193614	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
L193613	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
L193612	u5116	m339	MALLOY	L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
L193601	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
L193600	u5116	m339	MALLOY	The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
L193574	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
L193573	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
L193559	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
L193558	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
L193557	u5113	m339	BRAZEN	ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
L193850	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Yes...
L193849	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
L193848	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	I tried...
L193847	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
L193846	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Cuervo...?
L193795	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Go on now. Do as I say.
L193794	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Ooww!
L193793	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
L193792	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
L193791	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
L193790	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You never heard of Snake Plissken?
L193789	u5124	m339	UTOPIA	Who's that?
L193992	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo, look out behind you!
L193991	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
L193990	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	He's... near.
L193989	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Where's Plissken?
L193988	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	It's so good to see you again.
L193987	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	What?
L193986	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Oh Cuervo...
L193985	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Where?
L193984	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I thought he was, but he came back.
L193983	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	You told me he was dead.
L193982	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
L193842	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
L193841	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Give it.
L193840	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
L193839	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Give it to me.
L193838	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
L193837	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	Where is he?
L193778	u5114	m339	CUERVO JONES	We'll see.
L193777	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
L193962	u5115	m339	HERSHE	My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
L193961	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
L193954	u5115	m339	HERSHE	You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
L193953	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Shit.
L193943	u5122	m339	SPINAL	I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
L193942	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
L193926	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
L193925	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
L193919	u5115	m339	HERSHE	We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
L193918	u5122	m339	SPINAL	I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
L194014	u5115	m339	HERSHE	My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
L194013	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
L194012	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Can you land?
L194011	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
L193995	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Somebody get off!
L193994	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
L193969	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
L193968	u5115	m339	HERSHE	See you in hell, Snake.
L193952	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I don't know yet.
L193951	u5115	m339	HERSHE	No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
L193950	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
L193949	u5115	m339	HERSHE	I don't know, sounds thin to me.
L193937	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
L193936	u5115	m339	HERSHE	So what's the deal, gorgeous?
L193924	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Say goodnight, Carjack.
L193923	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Dream on, blue eye.
L193922	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
L193921	u5115	m339	HERSHE	I see your point. What's the favor?
L193920	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'm already dead.
L193916	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I got a new deal for you.
L193915	u5115	m339	HERSHE	All right, so I made another deal.
L193914	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Don't lie to me.
L193913	u5115	m339	HERSHE	I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
L193908	u5115	m339	HERSHE	Not anymore.
L193907	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
L193906	u5115	m339	HERSHE	What's in it for me?
L193905	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I need a favor.
L194041	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	The name's Plissken.
L194040	u5116	m339	MALLOY	You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
L194039	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Got a smoke?
L194005	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah, I got it.
L194004	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
L193651	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	It's history. I gotta go.
L193650	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
L193649	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'm here.
L193648	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Plissken...?
L193641	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
L193640	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	75% power.
L193639	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
L193638	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Locked.
L193637	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Lock fuel rods.
L193636	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	She's in the green.
L193631	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Good.
L193630	u5116	m339	MALLOY	No.
L193629	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Not you?
L193628	u5116	m339	MALLOY	A medical team will be standing by.
L193627	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
L193626	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
L193625	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
L193624	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
L193623	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where do I put ashore?
L193621	u5116	m339	MALLOY	All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
L193620	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	So what does this thing do?
L193619	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
L193618	u5116	m339	MALLOY	There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
L193617	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Defense against what?
L193616	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
L193615	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'll need to know more about this thing.
L193607	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Call me Snake.
L193606	u5116	m339	MALLOY	I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
L193605	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Get this crap out of me.
L193599	u5116	m339	MALLOY	You don't understand. It's already in you.
L193598	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
L193597	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Having second thoughts?
L193596	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
L193585	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
L193584	u5116	m339	MALLOY	That's the deal.
L193583	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
L193582	u5116	m339	MALLOY	That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
L193581	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
L193580	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Top secret. Only on a need to know.
L193579	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	What's the little black box do?
L193578	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Shut up, Plissken.
L193562	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
L193561	u5116	m339	MALLOY	How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
L194036	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
L194035	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
L193897	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
L193896	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Does he know how to activate it?
L193895	u5116	m339	MALLOY	The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
L193858	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	So where's Plissken?
L193857	u5116	m339	MALLOY	Getting ready to invade.
L193589	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
L193588	u5116	m339	MALLOY	It's the President, for Christ's sake!
L193975	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
L193974	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Is that what I think it is?
L193966	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	If he lets you get close enough.
L193965	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
L193964	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah, kinda.
L193963	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
L193960	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Don't like it, don't come.
L193959	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I don't know about this thing.
L193948	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
L193947	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Aw, come on, Snake.
L193941	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	We'll see.
L193940	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Me too?
L193935	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
L193934	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	How do you know all this?
L193890	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
L193889	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Cease fire with the bullshit.
L193888	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
L193887	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Later.
L193886	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
L193885	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
L193823	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
L193822	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Not yet.
L193820	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
L193819	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where are they going?
L193771	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Right over there.
L193770	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where is it?
L193769	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
L193768	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I said pull over.
L193767	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	No way.
L193766	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Stop the damn car.
L193765	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
L193764	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Delgado?
L193763	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
L193686	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
L193685	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Location.
L193684	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
L193683	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where are they?
L193681	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
L193680	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where'd they go?
L193679	u5117	m339	MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE	You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
L193742	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
L193741	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
L193740	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
L193726	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Which way?
L193725	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
L193724	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Looking to get out.
L193723	u5118	m339	PENDEJO BOB	What're you doing in here?
L193874	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
L193873	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Who?
L193872	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
L193870	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
L193869	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where?
L193868	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
L193867	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
L193866	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
L193657	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Down that way.
L193656	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
L193655	u5119	m339	PIPELINE	Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
L193759	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Who?
L193758	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Run, Snake...They're coming.
L193757	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
L193756	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Find Cuervo Jones.
L193755	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	What are you gonna do in Venice?
L193754	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
L193753	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
L193752	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	The freeway.
L193751	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	What the hell is this?
L193750	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
L193738	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
L193737	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
L193722	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
L193721	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Snake - what is it?
L193719	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Sewers. Come on.
L193718	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	How do we get out of here?
L193716	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	The what?
L193715	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
L193713	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
L193712	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
L193710	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Like hell I do.
L193709	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	You need help.
L193708	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Don't follow me.
L193702	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
L193701	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Who?
L193700	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Oh no, it's the Doctor.
L193699	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	No screamin' shit.
L193698	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
L193697	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	What are they?
L193694	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
L193693	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Are you crazy?
L193692	u5123	m339	TASLIMA	Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
L194029	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Give me the prototype.
L194028	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Where's the anti-toxin...?
L194003	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Thank God.
L194002	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
L193594	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
L193593	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	You're running out of time.
L193592	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Well, I'll think it over.
L193591	u5121	m339	PRESIDENT	Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
L193590	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
L193946	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
L193945	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
L193944	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
L193939	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah.
L193938	u5122	m339	SPINAL	All of us?
L193912	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
L193911	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
L193910	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
L193666	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Who ain't?
L193665	u5120	m339	PLISSKEN	I'm looking for somebody.
L193664	u5122	m339	SPINAL	Hey, what's going down, Snake?
L197359	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
L197358	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
L197357	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	...I saw nothing.
L197356	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	When you threw it in, what did you see?
L197353	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
L197352	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	I cannot--
L197351	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
L197150	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	...Perceval!
L197149	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
L197143	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
L197142	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Is he coming?
L197342	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
L197341	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
L197340	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
L197339	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
L197338	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Arthur.
L197170	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	It is deep...
L197169	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
L197162	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
L197161	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
L197035	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
L197034	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
L197032	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
L197031	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
L197011	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
L197010	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
L197007	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
L197006	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
L197005	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I gave up my castles and my lands!
L197004	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	But your life and lands are far from here.
L197003	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
L197002	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
L197001	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
L197000	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Thanks to God, you are alive.
L196991	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
L196990	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	So be it, to the death.
L196989	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
L196988	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I sought only not to harm you, sir.
L196987	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
L196986	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I will not.
L196985	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Yield. I have the advantage.
L196981	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
L196980	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Move aside!
L196979	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
L196978	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
L196977	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
L196976	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
L196975	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
L196974	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
L196973	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Good day to you, sir.
L197332	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
L197331	u5128	m340	KAY	He can be no other.
L197309	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
L197308	u5128	m340	KAY	Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
L197307	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Of Merlin?
L197306	u5128	m340	KAY	Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
L197280	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
L197279	u5128	m340	KAY	Perceval, you have returned!
L197252	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
L197251	u5128	m340	KAY	Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
L197250	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	At last...
L197304	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
L197303	u5130	m340	MERLIN	--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
L197302	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
L197301	u5130	m340	MERLIN	But, I'm here.
L197300	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
L197299	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	What is this place, Merlin?
L197298	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
L197297	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
L197186	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
L197185	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
L197184	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
L197183	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
L197182	u5130	m340	MERLIN	My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
L197181	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
L197180	u5130	m340	MERLIN	That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
L197179	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
L197166	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
L197165	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
L197159	u5130	m340	MERLIN	A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
L197158	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
L197157	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Yes.
L197155	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What is it my child?
L197154	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
L197111	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
L197110	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
L197109	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
L197108	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
L197107	u5130	m340	MERLIN	At your service, sir.
L197040	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	...to ride out and meet them.
L197039	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
L196998	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
L196997	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Excalibur! Is it true?
L196972	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
L196971	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
L196970	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
L196969	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
L196968	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I should have left you to fend for yourself.
L196958	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
L196957	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Guenevere...
L196956	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
L196955	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
L196954	u5130	m340	MERLIN	There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
L196953	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
L196952	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	...of course...
L196951	u5130	m340	MERLIN	A king must marry, after all.
L196931	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What's this, what's this?!
L196930	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
L196912	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The dragon! There...
L196911	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	What?!
L196910	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
L196909	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	What book is that?
L196908	u5130	m340	MERLIN	In the great book.
L196907	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	How? Where?
L196904	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
L196903	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
L196902	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Thank you.
L196901	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
L196900	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
L196899	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
L196898	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
L196896	u5130	m340	MERLIN	'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
L196895	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
L196894	u5130	m340	MERLIN	That's not why you came.
L196893	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I want to thank you.
L196892	u5130	m340	MERLIN	But not from your destiny.
L196891	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You saved me from the arrow...
L196883	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
L196882	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Whose son am I?
L196880	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Speak of the devil!...
L196879	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Who is Merlin?
L197264	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	So be it.
L197263	u5131	m340	MORDRED	I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
L197261	u5131	m340	MORDRED	And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
L197260	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
L197259	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Your mother told you that?
L197258	u5131	m340	MORDRED	The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
L197257	u5131	m340	MORDRED	And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
L197256	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I recognize you only as my son, no more.
L197255	u5131	m340	MORDRED	I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
L197254	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Rise, Mordred.
L197253	u5131	m340	MORDRED	Father...
L196965	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
L196964	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
L196878	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
L196877	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Who is, then?
L196867	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
L196866	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	You freed it, son?
L196865	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
L196853	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	Well hurry then, and get it.
L196852	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I left it in the tent, sir.
L197286	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	I have kept it.
L197285	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
L197284	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
L197140	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
L197139	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
L197138	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	And you cannot love me...
L197137	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
L197136	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Why can't you be my champion?
L197125	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Not you, my husband?
L197124	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
L197118	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
L197117	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
L197043	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Without Lancelot?!
L197042	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Don't start a war on my wedding day!
L197041	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
L197037	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
L197036	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
L196947	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
L196946	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I'm going.
L196945	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
L196944	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
L196943	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
L196942	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
L196941	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
L196939	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
L196938	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Ye...
L196937	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	It didn't hurt too much, did it?
L197275	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
L197274	u5126	m340	FIGURE	I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
L197273	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	Because you and the land are one.
L197272	u5126	m340	FIGURE	I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
L197271	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	You, my lord.
L197270	u5126	m340	FIGURE	Who does it serve?
L197195	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	We are to blame.
L197194	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	The King without his sword, the land without a king...
L197193	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	He has given up.
L197192	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Why didn't he kill us?
L197176	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	--Nothing!
L197175	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	There are things about love--
L197174	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Love demands it.
L197173	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	The law forbids it.
L197057	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
L197056	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	To me? But why?
L197055	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Yes. I would swear my love to you.
L197054	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Me?
L197053	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	You.
L197052	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Who?!
L197051	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	There is one.
L197050	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
L197049	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
L197048	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Why?
L197047	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	No.
L197046	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
L197135	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
L197134	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
L197084	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	Twenty days!? The world is that big?
L197083	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
L197082	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	I will run.
L197081	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Very well. Climb up.
L197077	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
L197076	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
L197319	u5132	m340	MORGANA	--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
L197318	u5130	m340	MERLIN	--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
L197317	u5132	m340	MORGANA	I am the desert, where water disappears--
L197316	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
L197312	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
L197311	u5132	m340	MORGANA	You provoke me, Merlin.
L197209	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
L197208	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
L197206	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
L197205	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
L197204	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
L197203	u5132	m340	MORGANA	You are truly magnificent!
L197199	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Why?
L197198	u5130	m340	MERLIN	They do.
L197197	u5132	m340	MORGANA	People make you laugh?
L197196	u5130	m340	MERLIN	When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
L197190	u5130	m340	MERLIN	That I cannot.
L197189	u5132	m340	MORGANA	You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
L197105	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Maybe... maybe...
L197104	u5132	m340	MORGANA	The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
L197103	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
L197101	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
L197100	u5132	m340	MORGANA	A lovestruck page!
L197099	u5130	m340	MERLIN	No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
L197098	u5132	m340	MORGANA	It's clear you are, and it irks me.
L197097	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I'm not jealous!
L197096	u5130	m340	MERLIN	No, no, of course not. You are young...
L197067	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Can it truly be used for magic?
L197066	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It is.
L197065	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
L197064	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
L196838	u5130	m340	MERLIN	They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
L196837	u5135	m340	UTHER	You strike me with words as hard as steel.
L196836	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
L196835	u5135	m340	UTHER	To kill and be king, is that all?
L196834	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
L196830	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You didn't ask!
L196829	u5135	m340	UTHER	The oath. You didn't say--
L196828	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
L196827	u5135	m340	UTHER	I?
L196826	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Now you must pay me.
L196825	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
L196824	u5135	m340	UTHER	Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
L196788	u5135	m340	UTHER	I swear it.
L196787	u5130	m340	MERLIN	--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
L196786	u5135	m340	UTHER	I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
L196782	u5135	m340	UTHER	Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
L196781	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
L196761	u5135	m340	UTHER	One land, one king! That is my peace!
L196760	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
L196759	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Just show the sword.
L196758	u5135	m340	UTHER	I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
L196756	u5135	m340	UTHER	Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
L196755	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
L204598	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
L204597	u5219	m345	THE THING	I mean...
L204596	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
L204595	u5219	m345	THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
L204593	u5219	m345	THE THING	This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
L204592	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
L204591	u5219	m345	THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
L204797	u5211	m345	BEN	I like the sound of that.
L204796	u5210	m345	ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
L204590	u5210	m345	ALICIA	My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
L204589	u5211	m345	BEN	Those yours too?
L204588	u5211	m345	BEN	No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
L204587	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
L204586	u5211	m345	BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
L204585	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
L204584	u5211	m345	BEN	How'd you know it was me?
L204457	u5211	m345	BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
L204456	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
L204453	u5211	m345	BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
L204452	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
L204794	u5211	m345	BEN	Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
L204793	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
L204784	u5211	m345	BEN	Got it, teach.
L204783	u5216	m345	REED	Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
L204650	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
L204649	u5211	m345	BEN	"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
L204647	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
L204646	u5216	m345	REED	We're working as hard as we can --
L204645	u5211	m345	BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
L204644	u5216	m345	REED	Ben --
L204525	u5216	m345	REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
L204524	u5211	m345	BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
L204363	u5216	m345	REED	O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
L204362	u5211	m345	BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
L204361	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
L204360	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
L204359	u5216	m345	REED	Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
L204343	u5216	m345	REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
L204342	u5211	m345	BEN	You got a chisel round here?
L204308	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.
L204307	u5216	m345	REED	We had a tough year.
L204263	u5211	m345	BEN	Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
L204262	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  Are you okay?
L204261	u5211	m345	BEN	What the --!
L204165	u5211	m345	BEN	I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
L204164	u5216	m345	REED	Are you alright?
L204137	u5211	m345	BEN	Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
L204136	u5216	m345	REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
L204135	u5211	m345	BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
L204134	u5216	m345	REED	What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
L204133	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
L204132	u5216	m345	REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
L204131	u5211	m345	BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
L204129	u5216	m345	REED	I should have done more, run more tests --
L204128	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
L204127	u5216	m345	REED	I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
L204125	u5211	m345	BEN	Solid.
L204124	u5216	m345	REED	Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
L204123	u5211	m345	BEN	How long was I out?
L204059	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
L204058	u5211	m345	BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
L204025	u5211	m345	BEN	<u>Should</u>?
L204024	u5216	m345	REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
L204005	u5216	m345	REED	Victor's better at these things.
L204004	u5211	m345	BEN	This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
L204003	u5216	m345	REED	He's made a few changes.
L204002	u5211	m345	BEN	Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
L203982	u5211	m345	BEN	This makes five.
L203981	u5216	m345	REED	I had it at four.
L203980	u5211	m345	BEN	Five times.
L203979	u5216	m345	REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
L203978	u5216	m345	REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.
L203977	u5211	m345	BEN	They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
L203976	u5216	m345	REED	Youthful high spirits.
L203975	u5211	m345	BEN	No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
L203974	u5216	m345	REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
L203973	u5211	m345	BEN	Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
L203961	u5211	m345	BEN	I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
L203960	u5216	m345	REED	We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
L203959	u5211	m345	BEN	Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
L203958	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
L203957	u5211	m345	BEN	He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
L203948	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
L203947	u5211	m345	BEN	What about his first born?
L203933	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
L203932	u5211	m345	BEN	I can't take this.
L203917	u5211	m345	BEN	You'd never know it.
L203916	u5216	m345	REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
L203915	u5216	m345	REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
L203914	u5211	m345	BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
L204807	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
L204806	u5211	m345	BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
L204724	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
L204723	u5211	m345	BEN	The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
L204661	u5211	m345	BEN	Go back to the drawing board.
L204660	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
L204091	u5211	m345	BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!
L204090	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
L204089	u5211	m345	BEN	Give me a mirror...
L204088	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
L204087	u5211	m345	BEN	What's wrong with me?
L204086	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
L204085	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed? ... Sue?
L204084	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
L204083	u5211	m345	BEN	Where...where am I?
L204039	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.
L204038	u5211	m345	BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
L204037	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
L204036	u5211	m345	BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
L204035	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
L204034	u5211	m345	BEN	'Course not.  Strictly business.
L204033	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
L204017	u5211	m345	BEN	Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
L204016	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
L204011	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
L204010	u5211	m345	BEN	What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
L204441	u5211	m345	BEN	I already got it.  Everything I want.
L204440	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
L204225	u5211	m345	BEN	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
L204224	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
L204223	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.
L204222	u5211	m345	BEN	"Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
L204221	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Ben?
L204219	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
L204218	u5211	m345	BEN	Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
L204009	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
L204008	u5211	m345	BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
L204007	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
L204006	u5211	m345	BEN	I'll be watching over you.
L204694	u5211	m345	BEN	And you can?  Power it up?
L204693	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
L204692	u5220	m345	VICTOR	He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
L204691	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
L204690	u5220	m345	VICTOR	To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
L204689	u5211	m345	BEN	What do you want, Vic?
L204686	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
L204685	u5211	m345	BEN	What is this?  Where's Reed?
L204684	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Ben, come in.
L204634	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
L204633	u5211	m345	BEN	About me?  How sweet.
L204632	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
L204631	u5211	m345	BEN	What are <u>you</u> doing here?
L204726	u5211	m345	BEN	Victor must've taken him.
L204725	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>Where is Reed</u>?
L204543	u5218	m345	SUE	No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
L204542	u5211	m345	BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
L204541	u5218	m345	SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
L204540	u5211	m345	BEN	It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
L204539	u5218	m345	SUE	He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
L204500	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
L204499	u5211	m345	BEN	Oh, he did.
L204498	u5218	m345	SUE	He didn't.
L204396	u5211	m345	BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
L204395	u5218	m345	SUE	The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
L204394	u5211	m345	BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
L204345	u5211	m345	BEN	Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
L204344	u5218	m345	SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
L204160	u5211	m345	BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
L204159	u5218	m345	SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
L204023	u5211	m345	BEN	Is it safe?
L204022	u5218	m345	SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
L203986	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor did.
L203985	u5211	m345	BEN	I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
L203968	u5218	m345	SUE	I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
L203967	u5211	m345	BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
L204414	u5220	m345	VICTOR	That's terrible news...
L204413	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
L204411	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
L204410	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What?
L204409	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
L204408	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"What do you mean ""complete""?"
L204407	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
L204406	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
L204405	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
L204404	u5220	m345	VICTOR	And they're changing into...

L204533	u5216	m345	REED	You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
L204445	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.
L204444	u5216	m345	REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
L204398	u5216	m345	REED	They're not costumes.
L204397	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
L204367	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
L204366	u5216	m345	REED	What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
L204365	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --

L204142	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I though we went over this.

L204140	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Me like-y.
L204122	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.

L204721	u5218	m345	SUE	No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
L204720	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
L204668	u5218	m345	SUE	As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
L204667	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
L204666	u5218	m345	SUE	Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
L204665	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
L204664	u5218	m345	SUE	"Is that what you call it?  ""<i>Real</i>""?"
L204663	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.

L204354	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Sweet.
L204353	u5218	m345	SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --

L204318	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
L204317	u5218	m345	SUE	Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
L204316	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?

L204192	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
L204191	u5218	m345	SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
L203988	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203987	u5218	m345	SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L204231	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
L204230	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Front page?
L204229	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L204228	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
L204158	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not <u>mine</u>."""
L204157	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
L204156	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
L204155	u5215	m345	LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L204154	u5220	m345	VICTOR	And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
L204153	u5215	m345	LEONARD	"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
L204152	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L204151	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L204150	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L204149	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L204148	u5220	m345	VICTOR	How's the IPO?
L204021	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
L204020	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
L203999	u5220	m345	VICTOR	History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203998	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Then what is it?
L203997	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
L203996	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203995	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Showtime.
L203994	u5215	m345	LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
L203956	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203955	u5215	m345	LEONARD	And if he's not...?
L203954	u5220	m345	VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L204566	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
L204565	u5216	m345	REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
L204564	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L204563	u5216	m345	REED	What are you doing here?
L204338	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
L204337	u5216	m345	REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L204336	u5220	m345	VICTOR	<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
L204335	u5216	m345	REED	<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L204334	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
L204331	u5216	m345	REED	Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L204330	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L204211	u5216	m345	REED	He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
L204210	u5220	m345	VICTOR	<u>Ben</u> did this?
L204209	u5216	m345	REED	Ben did this.
L204208	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
L204067	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L204066	u5216	m345	REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
L204063	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.
L204062	u5216	m345	REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
L204056	u5220	m345	VICTOR	So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
L204055	u5216	m345	REED	Ben's still out there --
L204054	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
L204053	u5216	m345	REED	We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
L204032	u5216	m345	REED	Sure.
L204031	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203953	u5216	m345	REED	Hilarious.
L203952	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203946	u5220	m345	VICTOR	The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
L203945	u5216	m345	REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203942	u5216	m345	REED	Not at all.
L203941	u5220	m345	VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203929	u5216	m345	REED	You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
L203928	u5220	m345	VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L204800	u5218	m345	SUE	A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
L204799	u5216	m345	REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
L204781	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204780	u5216	m345	REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L204675	u5218	m345	SUE	You <u>need</u> a doctor.
L204674	u5216	m345	REED	The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
L204673	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L204672	u5216	m345	REED	I can...make it work.
L204622	u5218	m345	SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L204621	u5216	m345	REED	Why didn't you say something?
L204620	u5218	m345	SUE	When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L204619	u5218	m345	SUE	I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
L204618	u5216	m345	REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L204615	u5218	m345	SUE	I gave him twenty.
L204614	u5216	m345	REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L204613	u5218	m345	SUE	Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L204612	u5216	m345	REED	You <u>were</u>?
L204611	u5218	m345	SUE	Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
L204610	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
L204609	u5216	m345	REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L204578	u5216	m345	REED	<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L204577	u5218	m345	SUE	Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
L204576	u5216	m345	REED	Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
L204575	u5218	m345	SUE	Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
L204574	u5216	m345	REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L204573	u5218	m345	SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L204492	u5216	m345	REED	No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
L204491	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
L204426	u5216	m345	REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
L204425	u5218	m345	SUE	And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
L204424	u5216	m345	REED	Of course.  Of course.
L204423	u5218	m345	SUE	But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
L204422	u5216	m345	REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L204421	u5218	m345	SUE	And reverse the mutations --
L204420	u5216	m345	REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L204419	u5216	m345	REED	The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L204418	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing?
L204389	u5218	m345	SUE	No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L204388	u5216	m345	REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
L204387	u5218	m345	SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L204386	u5216	m345	REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
L204385	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L204384	u5216	m345	REED	No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
L204383	u5218	m345	SUE	Are you kidding?
L204382	u5216	m345	REED	I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
L204381	u5216	m345	REED	What in the world would give me that idea?
L204380	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L204378	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204377	u5216	m345	REED	Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
L204376	u5218	m345	SUE	Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
L204375	u5216	m345	REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L204374	u5218	m345	SUE	Excuse me?
L204373	u5216	m345	REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L204369	u5218	m345	SUE	What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L204368	u5216	m345	REED	"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge."
L204315	u5218	m345	SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...
L204314	u5216	m345	REED	That's what we're here to find out.
L204313	u5218	m345	SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L204253	u5218	m345	SUE	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
L204252	u5216	m345	REED	Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
L204250	u5216	m345	REED	We need to get past them.
L204249	u5218	m345	SUE	What?
L204187	u5216	m345	REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
L204186	u5218	m345	SUE	It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
L204184	u5216	m345	REED	Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
L204183	u5218	m345	SUE	What?  What do you mean you --
L204182	u5216	m345	REED	Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
L204177	u5218	m345	SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
L204176	u5216	m345	REED	For science.
L204175	u5216	m345	REED	Passion.
L204174	u5218	m345	SUE	Which was?
L204173	u5216	m345	REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
L204172	u5218	m345	SUE	You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
L204170	u5218	m345	SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
L204169	u5216	m345	REED	That's good.  That's uh...good.
L204168	u5218	m345	SUE	Yes, thanks.
L204167	u5216	m345	REED	Feeling better?
L203991	u5218	m345	SUE	Great minds think alike.
L203990	u5216	m345	REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
L203972	u5218	m345	SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
L203971	u5216	m345	REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
L203970	u5218	m345	SUE	It's been changed.
L203969	u5216	m345	REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
L203966	u5218	m345	SUE	Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
L203965	u5216	m345	REED	Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
L203964	u5218	m345	SUE	I was talking about us.  Working together.
L203963	u5216	m345	REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
L203940	u5218	m345	SUE	Never better.
L203939	u5216	m345	REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
L204472	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
L204471	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
L204470	u5218	m345	SUE	Please don't make this personal --
L204469	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
L204468	u5218	m345	SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
L204467	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L204466	u5218	m345	SUE	He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L204464	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Susan.  What are you doing?
L204463	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L204462	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
L204461	u5218	m345	SUE	You said it was urgent.
L204326	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
L204325	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L204324	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
L204323	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, your scar --
L204214	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Just <u>find</u> him.
L204213	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
L204207	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?
L204206	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What's going on?
L204070	u5218	m345	SUE	You can't leave them out there.
L204069	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Raising the shields.
L204068	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing?
L204050	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L204049	u5218	m345	SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L204048	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L204047	u5218	m345	SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L204042	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L204041	u5218	m345	SUE	I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
L204040	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
L203936	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
L203935	u5218	m345	SUE	It's just business.
L204641	u5219	m345	THE THING	Skeptical...?
L204640	u5220	m345	VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
L204639	u5219	m345	THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
L204638	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
L204637	u5219	m345	THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
L204636	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
L204635	u5219	m345	THE THING	'Scuse me.
L205491	u5221	m346	CARTER	Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
L205490	u5230	m346	REID	I'd hold that off awhile.
L205489	u5221	m346	CARTER	Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
L205464	u5230	m346	REID	Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
L205463	u5221	m346	CARTER	If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
L205462	u5230	m346	REID	What're you getting at?
L205461	u5221	m346	CARTER	That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
L205460	u5230	m346	REID	What is it?
L205432	u5221	m346	CARTER	It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
L205431	u5230	m346	REID	Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
L205197	u5221	m346	CARTER	I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
L205196	u5230	m346	REID	I told you to cut down on the sugar.
L205194	u5221	m346	CARTER	Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
L205193	u5230	m346	REID	It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
L205192	u5221	m346	CARTER	Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
L205133	u5230	m346	REID	They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
L205132	u5221	m346	CARTER	They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
L205102	u5221	m346	CARTER	Message to Proteus.
L205101	u5230	m346	REID	<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
L205098	u5230	m346	REID	Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
L205097	u5221	m346	CARTER	What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
L205096	u5230	m346	REID	That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
L205095	u5221	m346	CARTER	At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
L205094	u5230	m346	REID	In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
L205093	u5221	m346	CARTER	I know that. But what's the maximum?
L205092	u5230	m346	REID	The less time, the better.
L205091	u5221	m346	CARTER	Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
L205088	u5221	m346	CARTER	Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
L205087	u5230	m346	REID	But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
L205086	u5221	m346	CARTER	We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
L205085	u5221	m346	CARTER	No...
L205084	u5230	m346	REID	But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
L205064	u5230	m346	REID	Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
L205063	u5221	m346	CARTER	That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
L205062	u5230	m346	REID	They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
L205013	u5221	m346	CARTER	Phase Two.
L205012	u5230	m346	REID	Okay to proceed.
L204949	u5230	m346	REID	Medical's ready.
L204948	u5221	m346	CARTER	Where do we stand?
L204931	u5221	m346	CARTER	We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
L204930	u5230	m346	REID	Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
L204908	u5230	m346	REID	Here's the overall Target Area...
L204907	u5221	m346	CARTER	Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
L205487	u5221	m346	CARTER	Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
L205486	u5224	m346	GRANT	Yes, we'd like to get moving.
L205479	u5221	m346	CARTER	He's blanked out on that one particular point.
L205478	u5224	m346	GRANT	Can't remember?... What do you mean?
L205477	u5221	m346	CARTER	Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
L204934	u5224	m346	GRANT	Where can I get a cab back to town?
L204933	u5221	m346	CARTER	Yes?
L204932	u5224	m346	GRANT	Just one, General...
L204929	u5224	m346	GRANT	Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
L204928	u5221	m346	CARTER	There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
L204900	u5224	m346	GRANT	Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
L204899	u5221	m346	CARTER	This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
L204889	u5224	m346	GRANT	Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
L204888	u5221	m346	CARTER	It's only for an hour --
L204887	u5224	m346	GRANT	But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
L204886	u5221	m346	CARTER	Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
L204885	u5224	m346	GRANT	Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
L204884	u5221	m346	CARTER	As part of the Crew.
L204883	u5224	m346	GRANT	You mean <I'm> going along?
L204882	u5221	m346	CARTER	Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
L204881	u5224	m346	GRANT	Trip? Where to?
L204880	u5221	m346	CARTER	And take a little trip with them...
L204879	u5224	m346	GRANT	They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
L204878	u5221	m346	CARTER	That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
L204877	u5224	m346	GRANT	I assume Benes knows how to control it.
L204876	u5221	m346	CARTER	They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
L204875	u5224	m346	GRANT	If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
L204874	u5221	m346	CARTER	We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
L204873	u5224	m346	GRANT	General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
L204870	u5224	m346	GRANT	Say that again?
L204869	u5221	m346	CARTER	<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
L204868	u5224	m346	GRANT	I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
L204867	u5221	m346	CARTER	No question of her loyalty.
L204866	u5224	m346	GRANT	His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
L204864	u5221	m346	CARTER	Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
L204863	u5224	m346	GRANT	Right, sir.
L204860	u5224	m346	GRANT	I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
L204859	u5221	m346	CARTER	We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
L204858	u5224	m346	GRANT	But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
L204849	u5221	m346	CARTER	Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
L204848	u5224	m346	GRANT	Wish I knew why.
L204843	u5224	m346	GRANT	What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
L204842	u5221	m346	CARTER	Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
L204841	u5224	m346	GRANT	Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
L204840	u5221	m346	CARTER	Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
L204839	u5221	m346	CARTER	Here's the Surgeon.
L204838	u5224	m346	GRANT	I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
L204836	u5224	m346	GRANT	<Me>?
L204835	u5221	m346	CARTER	-- and why we need you.
L204834	u5221	m346	CARTER	Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
L204833	u5224	m346	GRANT	Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
L204832	u5221	m346	CARTER	Brain injury.
L204831	u5224	m346	GRANT	How bad off is he?
L204830	u5221	m346	CARTER	The Other Side got to him.
L204829	u5224	m346	GRANT	Benes... What the devil happened?
L204828	u5224	m346	GRANT	The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
L204827	u5221	m346	CARTER	Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
L204862	u5221	m346	CARTER	And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
L204861	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
L204857	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
L204856	u5221	m346	CARTER	Difficult? He's impossible!
L204855	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
L204854	u5221	m346	CARTER	[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
L204847	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
L204846	u5221	m346	CARTER	Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
L204845	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes, Alan.
L205305	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
L205304	u5222	m346	CORA	Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
L205298	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
L205297	u5222	m346	CORA	You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
L205228	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	With no laser --
L205227	u5222	m346	CORA	We must!
L205226	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
L205219	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We'll know -- in the next breath...
L205218	u5222	m346	CORA	But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
L205189	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
L205188	u5222	m346	CORA	I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
L205115	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
L205114	u5222	m346	CORA	Listen...the Heart.
L205475	u5222	m346	CORA	He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
L205474	u5223	m346	DUVAL	He's making a fine recovery.
L205186	u5222	m346	CORA	I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
L205185	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
L205161	u5223	m346	DUVAL	No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
L205160	u5222	m346	CORA	Air bubbles!... Doctor --
L205080	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
L205079	u5222	m346	CORA	Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
L205068	u5222	m346	CORA	But big enough for us...
L205067	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
L205046	u5222	m346	CORA	They're much smaller than bacteria...
L205045	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
L205003	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Thank you for volunteering.
L205002	u5222	m346	CORA	I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
L205001	u5223	m346	DUVAL	What is it?  Anything wrong?
L205000	u5222	m346	CORA	I -- I want to say...
L204999	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yes, Cora.
L204998	u5222	m346	CORA	Doctor...
L205425	u5222	m346	CORA	Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
L205424	u5224	m346	GRANT	We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
L205356	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
L205355	u5222	m346	CORA	What do you mean?
L205354	u5224	m346	GRANT	Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
L205353	u5222	m346	CORA	Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
L205352	u5224	m346	GRANT	Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
L205351	u5222	m346	CORA	You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
L205350	u5224	m346	GRANT	As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
L205349	u5222	m346	CORA	That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
L205348	u5224	m346	GRANT	What gives you that idea?
L205347	u5222	m346	CORA	Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
L205346	u5224	m346	GRANT	Such as?
L205345	u5222	m346	CORA	A great deal more than that, I believe...
L205344	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's what they pay me for.
L205343	u5222	m346	CORA	Thank you for saving my life.
L205341	u5222	m346	CORA	I feel much better now...
L205340	u5224	m346	GRANT	No need to get up --
L205323	u5224	m346	GRANT	I can't till the hatch is flooded!
L205322	u5222	m346	CORA	Open it! Open it before they get here!
L205235	u5224	m346	GRANT	I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
L205234	u5222	m346	CORA	Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
L205233	u5224	m346	GRANT	A surgeon might...
L205232	u5222	m346	CORA	No, it requires such absolute precision --
L205231	u5224	m346	GRANT	If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
L205225	u5222	m346	CORA	Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
L205224	u5224	m346	GRANT	You must carry spare parts --
L205207	u5222	m346	CORA	You can't --it's too dangerous --
L205206	u5224	m346	GRANT	I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
L205200	u5224	m346	GRANT	Not now. We need air, not greetings!
L205199	u5222	m346	CORA	Shouldn't you answer that?
L205184	u5222	m346	CORA	I have no idea.
L205183	u5224	m346	GRANT	Then how come it worked loose?
L205182	u5222	m346	CORA	But I did. I'm positive!
L205181	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
L205145	u5222	m346	CORA	Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
L205144	u5224	m346	GRANT	Look at that...they're changing color...
L205106	u5222	m346	CORA	And if it should take more time to get through --
L205105	u5224	m346	GRANT	-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
L205040	u5224	m346	GRANT	I always thought it was nothing but red.
L205039	u5222	m346	CORA	I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
L204994	u5222	m346	CORA	Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
L204993	u5224	m346	GRANT	A long time, with one man.
L204992	u5222	m346	CORA	I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
L204991	u5224	m346	GRANT	I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
L204990	u5222	m346	CORA	Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
L204989	u5224	m346	GRANT	That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
L204988	u5224	m346	GRANT	Now I know...
L204987	u5222	m346	CORA	That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
L204984	u5222	m346	CORA	You may learn to like it.
L204983	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
L204982	u5222	m346	CORA	I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
L204981	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
L204980	u5222	m346	CORA	You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
L204979	u5224	m346	GRANT	I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
L204978	u5222	m346	CORA	We're pushing oxygen today.
L204977	u5224	m346	GRANT	Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
L205404	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
L205403	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
L205390	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
L205389	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Removal Point? What're you talking about!
L205384	u5223	m346	DUVAL	The Breath of God...
L205383	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	What's that?
L205382	u5223	m346	DUVAL	You left something out.
L205381	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
L205379	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
L205378	u5223	m346	DUVAL	The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
L205369	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
L205368	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
L205367	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
L205366	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
L205365	u5223	m346	DUVAL	If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
L205364	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
L205363	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I've done all I could with the laser.
L205362	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
L205361	u5223	m346	DUVAL	It's against my better Judgment...
L205339	u5223	m346	DUVAL	If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
L205338	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes...
L205337	u5223	m346	DUVAL	That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
L205217	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Nothing -- against all that force.
L205216	u5223	m346	DUVAL	What can we do?
L205153	u5223	m346	DUVAL	You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
L205152	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
L205108	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
L205107	u5223	m346	DUVAL	We can't take a second more.
L205058	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
L205057	u5223	m346	DUVAL	But that isn't possible.
L205049	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
L205048	u5223	m346	DUVAL	I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
L205047	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
L205022	u5223	m346	DUVAL	It's too late now. We must go on.
L205021	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
L205020	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Doctor, what's wrong?
L205456	u5224	m346	GRANT	It's too late!
L205455	u5223	m346	DUVAL	What about Dr. Michaels?
L205454	u5224	m346	GRANT	You said there was a quick way out!
L205436	u5223	m346	DUVAL	We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
L205435	u5224	m346	GRANT	The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
L205420	u5223	m346	DUVAL	It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
L205419	u5224	m346	GRANT	Doctor, we've just about had it.
L205413	u5223	m346	DUVAL	If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
L205412	u5224	m346	GRANT	How does it look, Doctor?
L205376	u5224	m346	GRANT	Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man...
L205375	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- 
L205284	u5224	m346	GRANT	Then why not take it?
L205283	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
L205282	u5224	m346	GRANT	Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
L205281	u5223	m346	DUVAL	We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
L205230	u5223	m346	DUVAL	No, there's no other way.
L205229	u5224	m346	GRANT	Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
L205172	u5224	m346	GRANT	Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
L205171	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
L205150	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Oxygenation...
L205149	u5224	m346	GRANT	Don't tell me they're refueling...
L205148	u5223	m346	DUVAL	A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
L205147	u5224	m346	GRANT	Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
L205139	u5223	m346	DUVAL	They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
L205138	u5224	m346	GRANT	I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
L205042	u5224	m346	GRANT	Quite a piece of plumbing.
L205041	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
L205038	u5223	m346	DUVAL	Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
L205037	u5224	m346	GRANT	You mean Inner Space is endless?
L205036	u5223	m346	DUVAL	The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
L205407	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
L205406	u5224	m346	GRANT	I don't believe that.
L205402	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
L205401	u5224	m346	GRANT	Sorry, but the situation has changed.
L205400	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
L205393	u5224	m346	GRANT	How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
L205392	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
L205391	u5224	m346	GRANT	Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
L205334	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
L205333	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like quite a way to go...
L205287	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
L205286	u5224	m346	GRANT	They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
L205277	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
L205276	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like somebody declared war.
L205271	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
L205270	u5224	m346	GRANT	Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
L205267	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
L205266	u5224	m346	GRANT	I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
L205265	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
L205261	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	It's possible --
L205260	u5224	m346	GRANT	Two in a row?
L205259	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
L205258	u5224	m346	GRANT	You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
L205257	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
L205256	u5224	m346	GRANT	That line was tampered with...
L205255	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	You have no right to blame Duval --
L205254	u5224	m346	GRANT	I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
L205253	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Sabotage? I don't understand...
L205252	u5224	m346	GRANT	Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
L205251	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
L205250	u5224	m346	GRANT	Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
L205249	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
L205248	u5224	m346	GRANT	Looks like the sea, at dawn.
L205241	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Send the following message...
L205240	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
L205239	u5224	m346	GRANT	They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
L205238	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
L205237	u5224	m346	GRANT	Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
L205236	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
L205212	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
L205211	u5224	m346	GRANT	All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
L205209	u5224	m346	GRANT	There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
L205208	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
L205204	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, we better get on with it.
L205203	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
L205176	u5224	m346	GRANT	If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
L205175	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	At this size, I would certainly think so.
L205126	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
L205125	u5224	m346	GRANT	There it is!
L205117	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
L205116	u5224	m346	GRANT	Sounds like heavy artillery...
L205083	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Request removal, Mr. Grant.
L205082	u5224	m346	GRANT	If there's any chance --
L205081	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Tell them to take us out.
L205078	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
L205077	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
L205074	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
L205073	u5224	m346	GRANT	If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
L205066	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
L205065	u5224	m346	GRANT	A what?
L204920	u5224	m346	GRANT	Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
L204919	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	About forty miles an hour.
L204902	u5224	m346	GRANT	How are you, Miss Peterson?
L204901	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
L204853	u5224	m346	GRANT	Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
L204852	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
L204851	u5224	m346	GRANT	At an operation?
L204850	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
L204821	u5224	m346	GRANT	And she said it was indelible...
L204820	u5225	m346	MAN	I'm married.
L204819	u5224	m346	GRANT	What'd you do that for?
L204818	u5224	m346	GRANT	Go ahead.
L204817	u5225	m346	MAN	May I?
L204816	u5225	m346	MAN	I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
L204815	u5224	m346	GRANT	Where we going?
L204814	u5225	m346	MAN	I can't tell you.
L204813	u5224	m346	GRANT	I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
L204812	u5225	m346	MAN	Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
L205498	u5224	m346	GRANT	Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
L205497	u5228	m346	OWENS	Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
L205496	u5224	m346	GRANT	We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
L205495	u5228	m346	OWENS	Uh -- what?
L205494	u5224	m346	GRANT	Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
L205452	u5224	m346	GRANT	We can get out through the Lab Section.
L205451	u5228	m346	OWENS	Come on -- it's no use!
L205446	u5224	m346	GRANT	Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
L205445	u5228	m346	OWENS	Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
L205444	u5224	m346	GRANT	What happened?
L205409	u5228	m346	OWENS	Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
L205408	u5224	m346	GRANT	I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
L205170	u5228	m346	OWENS	Enough to breathe, but that's all.
L205169	u5224	m346	GRANT	Any reserve air?
L204996	u5228	m346	OWENS	Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
L204995	u5224	m346	GRANT	'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
L204966	u5224	m346	GRANT	Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
L204965	u5228	m346	OWENS	Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
L204964	u5224	m346	GRANT	All in all, quite a canoe...
L204963	u5228	m346	OWENS	It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
L204962	u5224	m346	GRANT	That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
L204961	u5228	m346	OWENS	They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
L204960	u5224	m346	GRANT	If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
L204959	u5228	m346	OWENS	Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
L204958	u5224	m346	GRANT	Atomic fuel?
L204906	u5224	m346	GRANT	That makes two of us.
L204905	u5228	m346	OWENS	Sort of.
L204904	u5224	m346	GRANT	Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
L205300	u5224	m346	GRANT	I could use a lawnmower...
L205299	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	How's it look?
L205293	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
L205292	u5224	m346	GRANT	What's wrong, Skipper?
L205263	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	Look at those Walls up ahead!
L205262	u5224	m346	GRANT	Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
L205174	u5224	m346	GRANT	Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
L205173	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	Yes, there is.
L205156	u5229	m346	OWENS' VOICE	We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
L205155	u5224	m346	GRANT	What is it, Skipper?
L205178	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Yes, by all means. We must try it.
L205177	u5228	m346	OWENS	It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
L205165	u5228	m346	OWENS	Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
L205164	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Was there any damage?
L205163	u5228	m346	OWENS	Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
L205110	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
L205109	u5228	m346	OWENS	I'll never find my way through that.
L204975	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Looks simple to operate.
L204974	u5228	m346	OWENS	That's it...
L204972	u5228	m346	OWENS	On the Repeater.
L204971	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
L204925	u5226	m346	MICHAELS	The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
L204924	u5228	m346	OWENS	Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
L205417	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
L205416	u5228	m346	OWENS	What do you mean?
L205415	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
L205143	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
L205142	u5228	m346	OWENS	The Wall's transparent...
L205141	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
L205140	u5228	m346	OWENS	Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
L205072	u5228	m346	OWENS	I'll do what I can.
L205071	u5227	m346	MICHAELS' VOICE	Then don't drift down further.
L205070	u5228	m346	OWENS	We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
L216609	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	There's the Mekong.
L216608	u5296	m351	BREWER	... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
L216597	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	Star Wars?
L216596	u5296	m351	BREWER	Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
L216509	u5296	m351	BREWER	Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
L216508	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
L216507	u5296	m351	BREWER	Really?  How come he didn't take me?
L216506	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
L216388	u5296	m351	BREWER	What just happened?
L216387	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	Wow!
L216378	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
L216377	u5296	m351	BREWER	What's that?
L216376	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
L216375	u5296	m351	BREWER	You mean the snake?
L216372	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
L216371	u5296	m351	BREWER	No.
L216370	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
L216364	u5296	m351	BREWER	That's right, buddy.
L216363	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
L216362	u5296	m351	BREWER	Huh?
L216361	u5298	m351	DE FRAVIO	You guys are real... aren't you?
L216599	u5302	m351	RAMBO	How much we got left in that minigun?
L216598	u5296	m351	BREWER	You're gonna love it.
L216592	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Forget it.
L216591	u5296	m351	BREWER	It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
L216590	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
L216586	u5296	m351	BREWER	Duck soup.
L216585	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Can you handle the door gun?
L216584	u5296	m351	BREWER	Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
L216583	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You comin'?
L216582	u5296	m351	BREWER	Gawd, you look awful.
L216468	u5296	m351	BREWER	What... whattaya do?
L216467	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Yes.
L216466	u5296	m351	BREWER	Are they going to torture us?
L216402	u5296	m351	BREWER	Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
L216401	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You better take off.
L216347	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
L216346	u5296	m351	BREWER	It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
L216345	u5296	m351	BREWER	I suppose you have...
L216344	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You never been in one of those things.
L216343	u5296	m351	BREWER	What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
L216342	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I'm getting him out.
L216341	u5296	m351	BREWER	Nothing we can do, man.
L216340	u5302	m351	RAMBO	That guy's not going to make it.
L216339	u5296	m351	BREWER	Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
L216338	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
L216337	u5296	m351	BREWER	Alright.  Home run.
L216336	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Roundeye.
L216335	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Let me see.
L216334	u5296	m351	BREWER	Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
L216333	u5302	m351	RAMBO	American?
L216332	u5296	m351	BREWER	It's a guy in a cage.
L216326	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
L216325	u5296	m351	BREWER	Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
L216321	u5296	m351	BREWER	I need a vacation.
L216320	u5302	m351	RAMBO	How you doing, Brewer?
L216287	u5296	m351	BREWER	Pirates?  No kidding?
L216286	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
L216285	u5296	m351	BREWER	These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
L216284	u5296	m351	BREWER	Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
L216283	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Powerful warrior.
L216282	u5296	m351	BREWER	What's that?
L216281	u5302	m351	RAMBO	She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
L216280	u5296	m351	BREWER	What's she saying?
L216276	u5296	m351	BREWER	Yeah...
L216275	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
L216274	u5296	m351	BREWER	How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
L216273	u5302	m351	RAMBO	We'll check it out.
L216272	u5296	m351	BREWER	Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
L216271	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
L216266	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Fermented fish sauce.
L216265	u5296	m351	BREWER	What's this stuff on the rice?
L216243	u5296	m351	BREWER	I had it cupped.
L216242	u5302	m351	RAMBO	No cigarettes.
L216241	u5296	m351	BREWER	You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
L216239	u5296	m351	BREWER	Damn!  Leeches.
L216238	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
L216237	u5296	m351	BREWER	This place is a trip.
L216236	u5302	m351	RAMBO	There are no worse places.
L216235	u5296	m351	BREWER	I've seen worse places.
L216234	u5302	m351	RAMBO	That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
L216233	u5296	m351	BREWER	I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
L216232	u5302	m351	RAMBO	No.
L216231	u5296	m351	BREWER	You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
L216228	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Exactly.
L216227	u5296	m351	BREWER	And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
L216226	u5302	m351	RAMBO	There's a compass in the handle.
L216225	u5296	m351	BREWER	That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
L216224	u5296	m351	BREWER	Where's your stuff?
L216223	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
L216222	u5296	m351	BREWER	AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
L216221	u5302	m351	RAMBO	What's this?
L216220	u5296	m351	BREWER	This is state-of-the-art firepower.
L216219	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Batteries not included.
L216218	u5296	m351	BREWER	Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
L216217	u5302	m351	RAMBO	What do you call that?
L216212	u5296	m351	BREWER	Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
L216211	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You okay?
L216209	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Home on my strobe.
L216208	u5296	m351	BREWER	Read you.
L216207	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You read me, Brewer?
L216183	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
L216182	u5296	m351	BREWER	Yeah.  Why not?
L216179	u5296	m351	BREWER	We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
L216178	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
L216177	u5296	m351	BREWER	That's what I'm here for.
L216176	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Show me how it operates.
L216175	u5296	m351	BREWER	No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
L216172	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
L216171	u5296	m351	BREWER	Gettin' old, huh?
L216170	u5302	m351	RAMBO	One hundred.
L216169	u5296	m351	BREWER	... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
L216168	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Ninety.
L216167	u5296	m351	BREWER	... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
L216166	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Start over.
L216165	u5296	m351	BREWER	Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
L216164	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You stopped.
L216163	u5296	m351	BREWER	Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
L216162	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Again.
L216132	u5302	m351	RAMBO	No.
L216131	u5296	m351	BREWER	Ever do this from a jet?
L216116	u5296	m351	BREWER	Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
L216115	u5302	m351	RAMBO	This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
L216566	u5297	m351	CO	It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
L216565	u5302	m351	RAMBO	John.  My name is John.
L216562	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
L216561	u5297	m351	CO	What was that?
L216557	u5297	m351	CO	Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
L216556	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Look, Co...
L216551	u5302	m351	RAMBO	How?
L216550	u5297	m351	CO	Yes you can.
L216549	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I couldn't get you in.
L216548	u5297	m351	CO	I know.  I go with you.
L216547	u5302	m351	RAMBO	How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
L216546	u5297	m351	CO	"Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch ""Dynasty."""
L216545	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
L216544	u5297	m351	CO	You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
L216541	u5297	m351	CO	In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
L216540	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Invulnerable.
L216539	u5297	m351	CO	You think you are... .
L216538	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I do?
L216537	u5297	m351	CO	Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
L216536	u5302	m351	RAMBO	And how'd you sneak up like that?
L216535	u5297	m351	CO	Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
L216534	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Christ.  How'd you get here?
L216397	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Let's go.
L216396	u5297	m351	CO	Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
L216395	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Thanks.
L216392	u5297	m351	CO	They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
L216391	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Why'd they want us?
L216390	u5297	m351	CO	Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
L216389	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Are you okay?
L216317	u5297	m351	CO	Nguyen is good boy.
L216316	u5302	m351	RAMBO	It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
L216315	u5297	m351	CO	Huntington Beach, California.
L216314	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
L216312	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Where's his father?
L216311	u5297	m351	CO	Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
L216307	u5297	m351	CO	Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
L216306	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Intelligence work.
L216305	u5297	m351	CO	Spooks?
L216304	u5302	m351	RAMBO	How did you get started working for the spooks?
L216279	u5297	m351	CO	Crazy motherfucker.
L216278	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I thought he was with you.
L216277	u5297	m351	CO	Where did you find this clown?
L216270	u5297	m351	CO	I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
L216269	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Why's that?
L216268	u5297	m351	CO	I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
L216267	u5302	m351	RAMBO	How do we get upriver?
L216264	u5297	m351	CO	Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
L216263	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You really got a Masters Degree?
L216257	u5297	m351	CO	"It means ""virgin.""  My mother was comedian."
L216256	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
L216436	u5299	m351	DOYLE	Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
L216435	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	You pathetic scum.
L216432	u5299	m351	DOYLE	Sorry, Sir.
L216431	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	That's an order.
L216430	u5299	m351	DOYLE	Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
L216429	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Stay on your heading, Captain.
L216369	u5299	m351	DOYLE	Let's get that tent down!
L216368	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	"Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says ""May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."""
L216129	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	That's right.
L216128	u5302	m351	RAMBO	All this is for us?
L216121	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I was crossed-trained in gunships.
L216120	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
L216092	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
L216091	u5302	m351	RAMBO	We just take pictures?
L216090	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
L216089	u5302	m351	RAMBO	We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
L216088	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
L216087	u5302	m351	RAMBO	What's the plan?
L216086	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
L216070	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I'm not jumping blind.
L216069	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Not yet.
L216068	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Where?
L216067	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
L216066	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Why me?
L216065	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
L216064	u5302	m351	RAMBO	What's the job?
L216063	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
L216062	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
L216581	u5303	m351	TECH	He... took it.
L216580	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	What?
L216579	u5303	m351	TECH	... and then he, uh... took the other one.
L216578	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Christ almighty.
L216577	u5303	m351	TECH	Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
L216532	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	What?
L216531	u5303	m351	TECH	Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
L216530	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Typical...
L216529	u5303	m351	TECH	Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
L216528	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
L216463	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	What that?
L216462	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	It's not over.  You made one mistake.
L216461	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
L216457	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
L216456	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
L216455	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	"That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a ""B"".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way."
L216454	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Terminate with extreme prejudice.
L216453	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	"It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said ""No POWs"" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice."
L216452	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
L216451	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.
L216450	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	This mission was a scam from the word go?
L216449	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
L216448	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
L216447	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
L216446	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
L216445	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Not my people.
L216444	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
L216443	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Take your time.
L216302	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Have fun.
L216301	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	I know...
L216300	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
L216299	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	I know.
L216298	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	It's not necessary.
L216297	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
L216296	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	What's up?
L216154	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
L216153	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Black.  No sugar.
L216152	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
L216151	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	You think they'll find any?
L216150	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
L216149	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	How long before you're fully on line?
L216124	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Nice work.
L216123	u5300	m351	KIRKHILL	About 22 hours on site.
L216122	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	How long have you been setting up?
L216356	u5301	m351	PRISONER	De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
L216355	u5302	m351	RAMBO	What's your name?
L216354	u5301	m351	PRISONER	I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
L216353	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Can you walk?
L216352	u5301	m351	PRISONER	Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
L216351	u5302	m351	RAMBO	American.  Come to get you out.
L216350	u5301	m351	PRISONER	Who're you?
L216191	u5302	m351	RAMBO	You got it, sir.
L216190	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
L216189	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Let's do it.
L216118	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I say we tape him to a chair.
L216117	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
L216075	u5302	m351	RAMBO	This just occurred to somebody, now?
L216074	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
L216056	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
L216055	u5302	m351	RAMBO	"I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say ""you did good, John."" And mean it.  That's all.  After all that."
L216054	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	What did you want?
L216053	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
L216052	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
L216051	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Yeah.  Big time.
L216050	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Congressional Medal of Honor.
L216049	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	You're not.
L216048	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Those men are all dead.
L216047	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
L216046	u5302	m351	RAMBO	That's it.  My life.
L216045	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	This your stuff?
L216043	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
L216042	u5302	m351	RAMBO	There were treating me like a headcase.
L216041	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
L216040	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Am I out of here?
L216039	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
L216038	u5302	m351	RAMBO	I could take it or leave it.
L216037	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	I hear you're not enjoying it here.
L216036	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Mind if I sit down?
L216035	u5302	m351	RAMBO	Colonel.
L216034	u5304	m351	TRAUTMAN	Hello, John.
L220481	u5364	m356	FORD	I ain't -- got -- you.
L220480	u5361	m356	BAND	I said, I ain't got you...
L220479	u5364	m356	FORD	I said, I ain't got you...
L220478	u5361	m356	BAND	No, I ain't got you...
L220477	u5364	m356	FORD	No, I ain't got you...
L220476	u5361	m356	BAND	But I ain't got you...
L220475	u5364	m356	FORD	But I ain't got you...
L220664	u5364	m356	FORD	Thanks, I needed that.
L220663	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Art Mo-o-o-ney!
L220661	u5364	m356	FORD	What did these Vancouver factories do?
L220660	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	That was close...
L220658	u5364	m356	FORD	Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
L220657	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
L220656	u5364	m356	FORD	What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
L220655	u5364	m356	FORD	But I am...
L220654	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
L220652	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
L220651	u5364	m356	FORD	Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
L220650	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Did she tell you anything?
L220649	u5364	m356	FORD	Have what?
L220648	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
L220647	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
L220646	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
L220531	u5364	m356	FORD	Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
L220530	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
L220529	u5364	m356	FORD	Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
L220528	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I'll do my best.
L220527	u5364	m356	FORD	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
L220526	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
L220525	u5364	m356	FORD	Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
L220524	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	So you...
L220523	u5364	m356	FORD	Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
L220520	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
L220519	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
L220510	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Uh, let's go sit down.
L220509	u5364	m356	FORD	Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
L220508	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
L220442	u5364	m356	FORD	Nuthin'.
L220441	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Who?
L220440	u5364	m356	FORD	Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
L220439	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
L220438	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh... I have some questions.
L220437	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Actually, you may take it all now.
L220436	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
L220435	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
L220434	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
L220433	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Excuse me?
L220432	u5364	m356	FORD	No thanks.  I carry my own.
L220431	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
L220430	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
L220429	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
L220428	u5364	m356	FORD	Now that we've broken the ice...
L220427	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
L220426	u5364	m356	FORD	Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
L220425	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
L220424	u5364	m356	FORD	Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
L220423	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Who's your decorator?
L220422	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
L220421	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't know, I never met your father.
L220420	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
L220419	u5364	m356	FORD	Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
L220418	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Please.
L220417	u5364	m356	FORD	Don't say it.  Orange juice?
L220416	u5362	m356	COLLEEN	Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
L220922	u5364	m356	FORD	No prob...
L220921	u5363	m356	DON	Thanks for the promotion, man.
L220881	u5363	m356	DON	Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
L220880	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
L220484	u5363	m356	DON	Right away!
L220483	u5364	m356	FORD	Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
L220463	u5364	m356	FORD	I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
L220462	u5363	m356	DON	Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
L220452	u5363	m356	DON	Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
L220451	u5364	m356	FORD	I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
L220450	u5364	m356	FORD	Great pipes.
L220449	u5363	m356	DON	I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
L220270	u5364	m356	FORD	I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
L220269	u5363	m356	DON	You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
L220258	u5363	m356	DON	Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
L220257	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
L220256	u5363	m356	DON	Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
L220255	u5364	m356	FORD	So many assholes, so few bullets.
L220955	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Wha --
L220954	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
L220953	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
L220875	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
L220874	u5364	m356	FORD	After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
L220869	u5366	m356	JAZZ	But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
L220868	u5364	m356	FORD	Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
L220867	u5366	m356	JAZZ	C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
L220866	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
L220865	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
L220864	u5364	m356	FORD	What an interface!
L220855	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Johnny's C.D.?
L220854	u5364	m356	FORD	Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
L220757	u5364	m356	FORD	Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
L220756	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
L220751	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're not funny.
L220750	u5364	m356	FORD	Aha, just what I suspected!
L220748	u5364	m356	FORD	I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
L220747	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
L220743	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
L220742	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I came to warn you...
L220721	u5364	m356	FORD	What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
L220720	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Hello, Ford...
L220678	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
L220677	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Ah, an obvious choice.
L220676	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Who?
L220675	u5364	m356	FORD	Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
L220674	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You okay?
L220645	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
L220644	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, let's bury her.
L220643	u5366	m356	JAZZ	She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
L220638	u5364	m356	FORD	Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
L220637	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
L220636	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't know, what was the case?
L220633	u5364	m356	FORD	I like.
L220632	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Contacts.
L220631	u5364	m356	FORD	What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
L220562	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
L220561	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
L220560	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Make eye contact when you say that.
L220559	u5364	m356	FORD	I wish I knew.  You did good work...
L220558	u5366	m356	JAZZ	No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
L220557	u5364	m356	FORD	A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
L220556	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
L220555	u5364	m356	FORD	How'd you get this from her?
L220554	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
L220553	u5364	m356	FORD	Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
L220544	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
L220543	u5364	m356	FORD	And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
L220518	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Go on, 'they're stahting.'
L220517	u5364	m356	FORD	You going to be okay?
L220515	u5364	m356	FORD	This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
L220514	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
L220513	u5364	m356	FORD	Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
L220448	u5364	m356	FORD	Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
L220447	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Spooky.  I'll process her.
L220446	u5364	m356	FORD	Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
L220445	u5366	m356	JAZZ	I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
L220444	u5364	m356	FORD	Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
L220344	u5364	m356	FORD	Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
L220343	u5366	m356	JAZZ	So what about this watch?
L220342	u5364	m356	FORD	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
L220341	u5366	m356	JAZZ	That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
L220338	u5364	m356	FORD	I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
L220337	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
L220331	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
L220330	u5364	m356	FORD	Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
L220329	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You're saying you need money.
L220328	u5364	m356	FORD	Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
L220327	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
L220326	u5364	m356	FORD	Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
L220325	u5366	m356	JAZZ	G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
L220324	u5366	m356	JAZZ	'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
L220323	u5364	m356	FORD	I do it for love.
L220306	u5364	m356	FORD	Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
L220305	u5366	m356	JAZZ	You wish.
L220302	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Exactly.
L220301	u5364	m356	FORD	All your friends call you Jazz.
L220300	u5366	m356	JAZZ	Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
L220299	u5364	m356	FORD	Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
L220574	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
L220573	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Hey, they blew me.
L220572	u5364	m356	FORD	You gave it to the girls for one.
L220571	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Three hundred.
L220570	u5364	m356	FORD	How much?
L220569	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
L220568	u5364	m356	FORD	Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
L220567	u5370	m356	SLEAZY GUY	Got those Vomit invites here...
L220925	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
L220924	u5364	m356	FORD	So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
L220911	u5364	m356	FORD	Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
L220910	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
L220883	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll mail you a letter, come on!
L220882	u5373	m356	ZUZU	You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
L220861	u5364	m356	FORD	ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
L220860	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
L220852	u5373	m356	ZUZU	There's that question...
L220851	u5364	m356	FORD	Are you okay?
L220846	u5364	m356	FORD	You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
L220845	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
L220840	u5364	m356	FORD	This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
L220839	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
L220838	u5364	m356	FORD	I can't kill this kid's father...
L220837	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
L220836	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
L220829	u5364	m356	FORD	I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
L220828	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Ick.
L220821	u5364	m356	FORD	Why have you come to my planet?
L220820	u5373	m356	ZUZU	"Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see ""Batman,"" you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny."
L220819	u5364	m356	FORD	Pretty smooth, huh?
L220816	u5364	m356	FORD	Ye-ah.
L220815	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
L220814	u5364	m356	FORD	As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
L220813	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Suck a dick, I left my purse...
L220812	u5364	m356	FORD	No, wait...
L220811	u5373	m356	ZUZU	This way...
L220810	u5364	m356	FORD	Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
L220809	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Nice left you got there, jerk.
L220793	u5373	m356	ZUZU	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
L220792	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm afraid so, you want her?
L220769	u5364	m356	FORD	Ye-ah.
L220768	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Ford, you were right!
L220753	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
L220752	u5373	m356	ZUZU	This is boring, guys.
L220718	u5364	m356	FORD	Ye-ah.  Sure.
L220717	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
L220692	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
L220691	u5364	m356	FORD	My axe!
L220689	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
L220688	u5364	m356	FORD	Are you okay?
L220687	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hah fluck, great video, huh?
L220686	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu, wake up...
L220684	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Who cares about people?
L220683	u5364	m356	FORD	People still watch that?
L220682	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
L220681	u5373	m356	ZUZU	What a perv...
L220680	u5364	m356	FORD	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
L220679	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
L220641	u5373	m356	ZUZU	You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
L220640	u5364	m356	FORD	Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
L220639	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
L220629	u5364	m356	FORD	He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
L220628	u5373	m356	ZUZU	No.  Who's Art Mooney?
L220627	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
L220626	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
L220625	u5364	m356	FORD	You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
L220624	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Because I know rock-n-roll.
L220623	u5364	m356	FORD	How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
L220622	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Spunk, come back...
L220621	u5373	m356	ZUZU	It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
L220620	u5364	m356	FORD	What?  Jesus, tell me!
L220619	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
L220618	u5364	m356	FORD	You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
L220617	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
L220616	u5364	m356	FORD	Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
L220615	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Why are all these people after me?
L220614	u5364	m356	FORD	Let's get serious...
L220610	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Peachy.
L220609	u5364	m356	FORD	You okay?
L220608	u5364	m356	FORD	Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
L220607	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Hello?
L220606	u5364	m356	FORD	What?
L220605	u5373	m356	ZUZU	It's red, Ford.
L220582	u5373	m356	ZUZU	Fluck you!
L220581	u5364	m356	FORD	A simple 'please' would suffice...
L220580	u5373	m356	ZUZU	I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
L220579	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
L220952	u5372	m356	THE KID	Shut the heck up... Pop.
L220951	u5364	m356	FORD	I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
L220950	u5364	m356	FORD	He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
L220949	u5372	m356	THE KID	Who's my real father, man?
L220948	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
L220947	u5372	m356	THE KID	What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
L220946	u5364	m356	FORD	It's me.
L220945	u5364	m356	FORD	Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
L220944	u5372	m356	THE KID	Yeah, go on...
L220943	u5364	m356	FORD	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
L220942	u5372	m356	THE KID	So, did you find my dad?
L220708	u5372	m356	THE KID	Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
L220707	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
L220706	u5372	m356	THE KID	Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
L220705	u5364	m356	FORD	And hey, I appreciate it...
L220704	u5372	m356	THE KID	I tried to help you...!
L220703	u5364	m356	FORD	Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
L220702	u5372	m356	THE KID	Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
L220701	u5364	m356	FORD	Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
L220700	u5372	m356	THE KID	These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
L220699	u5364	m356	FORD	Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
L220698	u5372	m356	THE KID	I'm sorry...
L220414	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't need it that bad.
L220413	u5372	m356	THE KID	You need it.
L220412	u5364	m356	FORD	Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
L220411	u5372	m356	THE KID	I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
L220410	u5364	m356	FORD	Did he just say what I think he said?
L220409	u5372	m356	THE KID	This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
L220408	u5364	m356	FORD	Twelve pack?
L220407	u5372	m356	THE KID	Who cares?  I got a case.
L220406	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
L220405	u5372	m356	THE KID	Ouch.
L220296	u5372	m356	THE KID	Forget it.
L220295	u5364	m356	FORD	Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
L220294	u5372	m356	THE KID	I got something serious to dis-cuss.
L220293	u5364	m356	FORD	Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
L220292	u5372	m356	THE KID	When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
L220289	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
L220288	u5372	m356	THE KID	Gut feeling.
L220287	u5364	m356	FORD	Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
L220286	u5372	m356	THE KID	Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
L220672	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
L220671	u5364	m356	FORD	Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
L220670	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
L220669	u5364	m356	FORD	Really?
L220668	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
L220667	u5364	m356	FORD	That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
L220666	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
L220404	u5364	m356	FORD	You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
L220403	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
L220402	u5364	m356	FORD	I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
L220401	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Like me.
L220400	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
L220399	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	'Booty Time.'
L220398	u5364	m356	FORD	Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
L220397	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Two words.  Disco Express.
L220396	u5364	m356	FORD	Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
L220395	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
L220394	u5364	m356	FORD	Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
L220393	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	What are you running from?
L220391	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
L220390	u5364	m356	FORD	You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
L220389	u5368	m356	LT. AMOS	You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
L220388	u5364	m356	FORD	Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
L220940	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Anyway you want it, asshole.
L220939	u5364	m356	FORD	Let me go out like a man.
L220938	u5371	m356	SMILEY	The point?
L220937	u5364	m356	FORD	You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
L220936	u5371	m356	SMILEY	How's it going?
L220835	u5364	m356	FORD	Okay.  'B-y-e!
L220834	u5371	m356	SMILEY	<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
L220833	u5364	m356	FORD	I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
L220595	u5364	m356	FORD	Say cheese...
L220594	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
L220593	u5364	m356	FORD	You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
L220507	u5364	m356	FORD	<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
L220506	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
L220505	u5364	m356	FORD	The case!
L220504	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Off what?  Twenty seconds...
L220503	u5364	m356	FORD	I'm off it!
L220502	u5371	m356	SMILEY	What's fine?
L220501	u5364	m356	FORD	Fine!
L220500	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
L220499	u5364	m356	FORD	I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
L220498	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
L220496	u5364	m356	FORD	Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
L220495	u5371	m356	SMILEY	Polo.
L220917	u5364	m356	FORD	Julian, you're fired.
L220916	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	I'm still the king!
L220909	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
L220908	u5364	m356	FORD	Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
L220903	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
L220902	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
L220901	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
L220900	u5364	m356	FORD	Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
L220899	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Fuck me...
L220898	u5364	m356	FORD	And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
L220897	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
L220896	u5364	m356	FORD	You'd said something about proof...
L220804	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Ciao.
L220803	u5364	m356	FORD	Shit.
L220802	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
L220801	u5364	m356	FORD	When I say 'no,' run for the door.
L220799	u5364	m356	FORD	Are you okay?
L220798	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Kill them.  Not quickly.
L220788	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
L220787	u5364	m356	FORD	What about Don?
L220786	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
L220785	u5364	m356	FORD	I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
L220783	u5364	m356	FORD	Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
L220782	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
L220781	u5364	m356	FORD	<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
L220777	u5364	m356	FORD	Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
L220776	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	It doesn't have to be like this?
L220772	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
L220771	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
L220770	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
L220765	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Golly, I'd probably faint.
L220764	u5364	m356	FORD	And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
L220763	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Shock.
L220762	u5364	m356	FORD	Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
L220552	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Go on, another time, another place.
L220551	u5364	m356	FORD	Jazz, we're talking here.
L220547	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
L220546	u5364	m356	FORD	Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
L220545	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
L220542	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
L220541	u5364	m356	FORD	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
L220540	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Well, hello, Ford.
L220465	u5364	m356	FORD	I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
L220464	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
L220461	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
L220460	u5364	m356	FORD	I knew your father.  He was quite...
L220459	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
L220458	u5364	m356	FORD	Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
L220457	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
L220456	u5365	m356	GRENDEL	Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
L220455	u5364	m356	FORD	How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
L220746	u5364	m356	FORD	It is to us!  It's computerised.
L220745	u5369	m356	MELODI	This isn't music!
L220716	u5364	m356	FORD	Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
L220715	u5369	m356	MELODI	Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
L220713	u5364	m356	FORD	Hey, the poet...
L220712	u5369	m356	MELODI	Hi, private eye guy!
L220267	u5364	m356	FORD	I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
L220266	u5369	m356	MELODI	You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
L220265	u5364	m356	FORD	That's funny, you're cute.
L220264	u5369	m356	MELODI	That's cute.  You're funny.
L220263	u5364	m356	FORD	Only on a first name basis.
L220262	u5369	m356	MELODI	Do you really know everybody in the industry?
L220261	u5364	m356	FORD	You're a poet and didn't know it.
L220260	u5369	m356	MELODI	You're that guy, the private eye.
L220367	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
L220366	u5364	m356	FORD	Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
L220365	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
L220364	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
L220363	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
L220362	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	So...
L220359	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	What?
L220358	u5364	m356	FORD	'Bye, Johnny...
L220357	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
L220356	u5364	m356	FORD	How nice.
L220355	u5364	m356	FORD	Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
L220354	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
L220353	u5364	m356	FORD	Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
L220352	u5367	m356	JOHNNY	Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
L220351	u5364	m356	FORD	I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
L234453	u5496	m366	DOC	Get it over with...
L234452	u5494	m366	BEYNON	Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
L234450	u5496	m366	DOC	I bet.
L234449	u5494	m366	BEYNON	Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
L234448	u5496	m366	DOC	No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
L234447	u5494	m366	BEYNON	The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
L234446	u5496	m366	DOC	So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
L234445	u5494	m366	BEYNON	A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
L234444	u5496	m366	DOC	One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
L234443	u5494	m366	BEYNON	What do you add up to here?
L234442	u5496	m366	DOC	I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
L234441	u5494	m366	BEYNON	A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
L234439	u5496	m366	DOC	No applause!
L234438	u5494	m366	BEYNON	You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
L234437	u5496	m366	DOC	I'm in a hurry.
L234435	u5496	m366	DOC	No way. I always do my own work.
L234434	u5494	m366	BEYNON	You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
L234433	u5496	m366	DOC	That's your problem.
L234432	u5494	m366	BEYNON	They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
L234431	u5496	m366	DOC	You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
L234428	u5496	m366	DOC	What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
L234427	u5494	m366	BEYNON	What about your wife?
L234426	u5496	m366	DOC	That's right.
L234425	u5494	m366	BEYNON	And you got him...
L234424	u5496	m366	DOC	Three... Rudy got ambitious.
L234423	u5494	m366	BEYNON	News said two persons killed.
L234422	u5496	m366	DOC	Beynon.
L234421	u5494	m366	BEYNON	Hello, McCoy.
L234309	u5494	m366	BEYNON	Stay clean.
L234308	u5496	m366	DOC	I'll take care of my end.
L234307	u5494	m366	BEYNON	They will be ready. You guys do your job.
L234306	u5496	m366	DOC	Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
L234297	u5496	m366	DOC	I heard about you. You work with Miller.
L234296	u5494	m366	BEYNON	Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
L234295	u5494	m366	BEYNON	They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
L234294	u5496	m366	DOC	What about them?
L234293	u5494	m366	BEYNON	You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
L234292	u5496	m366	DOC	I get my own help.
L234291	u5494	m366	BEYNON	You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
L234290	u5494	m366	BEYNON	This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
L234289	u5496	m366	DOC	I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
L234288	u5494	m366	BEYNON	Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
L234287	u5496	m366	DOC	All it takes is a long arm.
L234285	u5494	m366	BEYNON	Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
L234284	u5496	m366	DOC	You gotta be kidding.

L234834	u5496	m366	DOC	Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
L234833	u5495	m366	CAROL	Are we going to make it?
L234807	u5496	m366	DOC	Pull over.
L234806	u5495	m366	CAROL	How long before this car's hot?
L234791	u5496	m366	DOC	Yeah.

L234745	u5496	m366	DOC	Whatever you say.

L234696	u5496	m366	DOC	You want to try with me?
L234695	u5495	m366	CAROL	Sounds good.
L234694	u5496	m366	DOC	Whatever happens it's over.
L234693	u5495	m366	CAROL	No more about Beynon.
L234692	u5496	m366	DOC	Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
L234691	u5495	m366	CAROL	I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
L234690	u5496	m366	DOC	I guess you're right.
L234689	u5495	m366	CAROL	We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
L234688	u5496	m366	DOC	We got this far.
L234687	u5495	m366	CAROL	I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
L234686	u5496	m366	DOC	Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
L234685	u5496	m366	DOC	Listen to me. It's hard enough.
L234684	u5495	m366	CAROL	I don't want to hear it.

L234679	u5496	m366	DOC	We better stick here till tonight.
L234678	u5495	m366	CAROL	It's all a game, don't bother me.
L234677	u5496	m366	DOC	Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
L234675	u5496	m366	DOC	No scars.
L234674	u5495	m366	CAROL	No scars?

L234671	u5496	m366	DOC	Okay?

L234616	u5496	m366	DOC	I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
L234615	u5495	m366	CAROL	I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
L234614	u5496	m366	DOC	You can't trust anything these days.
L234601	u5495	m366	CAROL	If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
L234600	u5496	m366	DOC	From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
L234597	u5495	m366	CAROL	I did I killed a man.
L234596	u5496	m366	DOC	When are you going to learn?
L234595	u5495	m366	CAROL	That would be the first time.
L234588	u5496	m366	DOC	El Paso.
L234587	u5495	m366	CAROL	Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
L234586	u5496	m366	DOC	I think you liked it with him.
L234585	u5495	m366	CAROL	You're full of ifs.
L234584	u5496	m366	DOC	If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
L234583	u5495	m366	CAROL	What?
L234580	u5496	m366	DOC	I didn't mean police.
L234579	u5495	m366	CAROL	Why, there's nothing on the news?
L234578	u5496	m366	DOC	There may be a hunting party.
L234576	u5495	m366	CAROL	Like what?
L234575	u5496	m366	DOC	No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
L234574	u5495	m366	CAROL	You've got it all figured.
L234573	u5496	m366	DOC	When they find it, they find it.
L234572	u5495	m366	CAROL	You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
L234571	u5496	m366	DOC	We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
L234569	u5496	m366	DOC	I mean it.

L234567	u5496	m366	DOC	Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
L234566	u5495	m366	CAROL	What do you want to do?
L234565	u5496	m366	DOC	You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
L234564	u5495	m366	CAROL	When we had trouble before it was different.
L234563	u5495	m366	CAROL	You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
L234562	u5496	m366	DOC	I'll bet you can.
L234561	u5495	m366	CAROL	I can handle it.
L234560	u5496	m366	DOC	Texas is a big state.
L234559	u5495	m366	CAROL	I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
L234558	u5496	m366	DOC	Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
L234517	u5495	m366	CAROL	You bastard...
L234516	u5496	m366	DOC	There better be a guy with the
L234514	u5496	m366	DOC	Sure?
L234513	u5495	m366	CAROL	Fifteen minutes.
L234512	u5496	m366	DOC	How long ago.
L234511	u5496	m366	DOC	It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
L234510	u5495	m366	CAROL	He must have.
L234509	u5496	m366	DOC	And switched keys.

L234457	u5496	m366	DOC	Yeah.
L234456	u5495	m366	CAROL	There wasn't any way to explain it.
L234455	u5496	m366	DOC	Why didn't you tell me?
L234419	u5496	m366	DOC	Do it my way.
L234418	u5495	m366	CAROL	I don't want to go there.
L234417	u5496	m366	DOC	If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
L234416	u5495	m366	CAROL	Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
L234415	u5496	m366	DOC	I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
L234414	u5495	m366	CAROL	Do you trust him?
L234413	u5495	m366	CAROL	"I've never ""been there... When we met it was in his office."

L234324	u5495	m366	CAROL	For exits off Main Street.
L234323	u5496	m366	DOC	Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
L234322	u5495	m366	CAROL	Usually on the right side as you go in.
L234321	u5496	m366	DOC	... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...

L234279	u5495	m366	CAROL	I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
L234278	u5496	m366	DOC	Why are you laughing?
L234277	u5495	m366	CAROL	But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.

L234244	u5496	m366	DOC	That's not all of it.
L234243	u5495	m366	CAROL	Nothing's been boring since you found me.
L234242	u5496	m366	DOC	Boring.
L234241	u5495	m366	CAROL	Fatter... some things never change.
L234240	u5496	m366	DOC	How's Estelle?

L234205	u5496	m366	DOC	I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
L234204	u5495	m366	CAROL	You okay?
L234203	u5496	m366	DOC	Hi.
L234202	u5495	m366	CAROL	Hello, Doc.
L234182	u5496	m366	DOC	No way. I've got to get out now.
L234181	u5495	m366	CAROL	We'll try again.
L234506	u5503	m366	SOLDIER	Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
L234505	u5495	m366	CAROL	I really hope you have a nice trip.
L234504	u5495	m366	CAROL	STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
L234503	u5503	m366	SOLDIER	I never have any luck.
L234502	u5495	m366	CAROL	No, I'm afraid not.
L234501	u5503	m366	SOLDIER	You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
L234500	u5503	m366	SOLDIER	Yeah... I guess it does.
L234499	u5495	m366	CAROL	That certainly makes you kind of special...
L234498	u5503	m366	SOLDIER	Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
L234497	u5495	m366	CAROL	No, I'm not.
L234496	u5503	m366	SOLDIER	Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
L234495	u5495	m366	CAROL	Where's home?
L234494	u5503	m366	SOLDIER	Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
L234493	u5495	m366	CAROL	That's right.
L234832	u5495	m366	CAROL	Tell her you robbed a bank...
L234831	u5502	m366	SLIM	One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
L234827	u5502	m366	SLIM	By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
L234826	u5495	m366	CAROL	Thanks. Hope you do too.
L234825	u5502	m366	SLIM	Hope you get to where you're going.
L234797	u5502	m366	SLIM	That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
L234796	u5495	m366	CAROL	Oh my God.
L234795	u5502	m366	SLIM	Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
L234634	u5496	m366	DOC	Might try that.
L234633	u5501	m366	SALESMAN	Gonna knock down a wall?
L234632	u5496	m366	DOC	Two boxes of double-ought buck.
L234631	u5501	m366	SALESMAN	All right. Shells?
L234630	u5496	m366	DOC	Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
L234629	u5501	m366	SALESMAN	Can I help you?
L234344	u5496	m366	DOC	Dillinger got killed.
L234343	u5500	m366	RUDY	It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
L234342	u5496	m366	DOC	What do you have in mind?
L234341	u5500	m366	RUDY	Aren't we going a little hard?
L234340	u5496	m366	DOC	I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie?s. Okay. Any questions?
L234337	u5500	m366	RUDY	Whatever you need.
L234336	u5496	m366	DOC	I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
L234335	u5500	m366	RUDY	I'm good at that.
L234334	u5496	m366	DOC	One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
L234333	u5500	m366	RUDY	Wire pull over?
L234332	u5496	m366	DOC	Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
L234331	u5500	m366	RUDY	What about the vault?
L234330	u5496	m366	DOC	Two.
L234329	u5500	m366	RUDY	Okay. How many bank exits?
L234328	u5496	m366	DOC	Suit yourself.
L234327	u5500	m366	RUDY	I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
L234326	u5496	m366	DOC	Just in case someone gets a shot off.
L234303	u5496	m366	DOC	What about you?

L234299	u5496	m366	DOC	Where?
L234298	u5500	m366	RUDY	You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
L234730	u5499	m366	LAUGHLIN	Can't leave the desk.
L234729	u5496	m366	DOC	Then you do it.
L234728	u5499	m366	LAUGHLIN	He took the day off.
L234727	u5496	m366	DOC	When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.

L234830	u5496	m366	DOC	Go with God.
L234829	u5502	m366	SLIM	Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
L234828	u5496	m366	DOC	Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
L234824	u5502	m366	SLIM	Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
L234823	u5496	m366	DOC	You're going to have to walk back to the border.
L234819	u5502	m366	SLIM	How about twenty thousand?
L234818	u5496	m366	DOC	You got it.
L234817	u5502	m366	SLIM	I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
L234816	u5496	m366	DOC	That's what I want.
L234815	u5502	m366	SLIM	And I keep my mouth shut?
L234814	u5496	m366	DOC	Sure am.
L234813	u5502	m366	SLIM	You serious?
L234812	u5496	m366	DOC	How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
L234811	u5502	m366	SLIM	'Bout five thousand.
L234810	u5496	m366	DOC	Come on. How much?
L234809	u5502	m366	SLIM	What's it to you?
L234808	u5496	m366	DOC	Listen... how much money did you make this year?
L234805	u5496	m366	DOC	Not now.
L234804	u5502	m366	SLIM	Don't you want to go to the airport?
L234803	u5496	m366	DOC	Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
L234802	u5502	m366	SLIM	Which way?
L234799	u5502	m366	SLIM	Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
L234798	u5496	m366	DOC	Let's just get to the border.
L234793	u5496	m366	DOC	I kinda doubt it.
L234792	u5502	m366	SLIM	I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
L234786	u5502	m366	SLIM	Why not?
L234785	u5496	m366	DOC	Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
L234784	u5502	m366	SLIM	Where we go in1?
L234783	u5496	m366	DOC	Just fine.
L234782	u5502	m366	SLIM	How was that?
L234781	u5502	m366	SLIM	Suit yourself.
L234780	u5496	m366	DOC	Drive.
L234544	u5500	m366	RUDY	I Just want to find a suitcase.
L234543	u5497	m366	FRAN	Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
L234526	u5497	m366	FRAN	That's what matters, isn't it?
L234525	u5500	m366	RUDY	Can he trust you?
L234524	u5497	m366	FRAN	Two years.
L234523	u5500	m366	RUDY	How long have you been married?
L234522	u5497	m366	FRAN	You can trust him...
L234521	u5500	m366	RUDY	That right?
L234520	u5497	m366	FRAN	I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
L234486	u5500	m366	RUDY	After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
L234485	u5497	m366	FRAN	You do what he says, Harold.
L234483	u5500	m366	RUDY	That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
L234482	u5497	m366	FRAN	A Ford... We have a Ford.
L234481	u5500	m366	RUDY	What kind of car do you have, Harold?
L234480	u5497	m366	FRAN	Just... tell us what you want.
L234479	u5500	m366	RUDY	Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
L234654	u5500	m366	RUDY	I'll tell you when.
L234653	u5498	m366	HAROLD	I've got to stop.
L234478	u5498	m366	HAROLD	That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
L234477	u5500	m366	RUDY	The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
L234476	u5498	m366	HAROLD	The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
L234475	u5500	m366	RUDY	I got a nurse in mind.
L234474	u5498	m366	HAROLD	Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
L234473	u5500	m366	RUDY	What's the damage?
L289047	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	A delegation.
L289046	u5909	m390	PAUL	We, who is we?
L289045	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
L288825	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
L288824	u5909	m390	PAUL	What happened?
L288440	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, it's a private function.
L288439	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
L288438	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
L288437	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Paul, Paul, a moment please.
L288725	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll be back.
L288724	u5898	m390	BIK	Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
L288477	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288476	u5898	m390	BIK	Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
L288475	u5909	m390	PAUL	Leave it to me.
L288474	u5898	m390	BIK	The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
L288473	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me?
L288472	u5898	m390	BIK	That's what I came to talk to you about.
L288471	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
L288469	u5898	m390	BIK	Cockroaches?
L288468	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
L288419	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
L288418	u5898	m390	BIK	Paul!
L288729	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
L288728	u5909	m390	PAUL	Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
L288718	u5909	m390	PAUL	I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
L288717	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
L288716	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
L288715	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Give me it.
L288714	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
L288713	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	And four children?
L288712	u5909	m390	PAUL	Ten.
L288701	u5909	m390	PAUL	Six.
L288700	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	How many in your family?
L288699	u5909	m390	PAUL	Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
L288697	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't have that much.
L288696	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Ten thousand francs for each one.
L288695	u5909	m390	PAUL	Name a price.
L288694	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	How much?
L288693	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
L288692	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You want to pay me?
L288689	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	There is nothing to it.
L288688	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, I don't use guns.
L288686	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let me explain.
L288685	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
L288671	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Where is your family?
L288670	u5909	m390	PAUL	Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
L288669	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288668	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
L288667	u5909	m390	PAUL	I used to work at the Diplomat.
L288666	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. I work at the Mille Collines.
L288665	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
L288664	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
L288663	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
L288662	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Let me see your identity card.
L288661	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is this about?
L288660	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	We are looking for you.
L288659	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
L288658	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Who are you?
L288801	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
L288800	u5903	m390	GLORIA	What was the response?
L288799	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes we have.
L288798	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Have you requested re-enforcements?
L288797	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
L288796	u5903	m390	GLORIA	If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
L288795	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
L288794	u5903	m390	GLORIA	We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
L288793	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
L288792	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
L289294	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
L289293	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
L289292	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
L289291	u5909	m390	PAUL	I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
L289290	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
L289280	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
L289279	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is it?
L289276	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I can't, I don't have the men.
L289275	u5909	m390	PAUL	Will you protect us.
L289274	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
L289273	u5909	m390	PAUL	I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
L289272	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
L289271	u5909	m390	PAUL	They fired a rocket at us.
L288886	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	They're only taking the whites.
L288885	u5909	m390	PAUL	Their people?
L288884	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
L288883	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
L288882	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't understand.
L288881	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
L288880	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me, Colonel.
L288879	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
L288878	u5909	m390	PAUL	Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
L288877	u5909	m390	PAUL	Canadian Club?
L288876	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Anything. Strong.
L288830	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where is she?
L288829	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
L288828	u5909	m390	PAUL	What's happening?
L288827	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
L288804	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
L288803	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
L288802	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
L288782	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
L288781	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
L288780	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, you know who this is?
L289344	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will do nothing unless you help me now.
L289343	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You will tell them the truth.
L289342	u5909	m390	PAUL	You think they will believe you?
L289341	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I led no massacres.
L289340	u5909	m390	PAUL	Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
L289339	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I committed no war crimes.
L289338	u5909	m390	PAUL	If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
L289337	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You lie.
L289336	u5909	m390	PAUL	When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
L289335	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am on a list! What list?
L289334	u5909	m390	PAUL	The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
L289333	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	How so.
L289332	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are a marked man.
L289331	u5909	m390	PAUL	Listen, you need me.
L289330	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	We are better here.
L289328	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
L289327	u5909	m390	PAUL	I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
L289326	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
L289325	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
L289324	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
L289323	u5909	m390	PAUL	I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
L289322	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
L289321	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, sir.
L289320	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
L289319	u5909	m390	PAUL	No.
L289318	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You know what the Scottish call it?
L289313	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Today.
L289312	u5909	m390	PAUL	When?
L289311	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
L289310	u5909	m390	PAUL	What do you mean, General?
L289309	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
L289308	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are they going?
L289307	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
L289306	u5909	m390	PAUL	Your police are at the gate?
L289305	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Get in.
L289304	u5909	m390	PAUL	We must go to the Diplomat.
L289303	u5909	m390	PAUL	Bring back your policemen...
L289302	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I'll be over.
L289301	u5909	m390	PAUL	The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
L289300	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Whiskey?
L289299	u5909	m390	PAUL	General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
L289250	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
L289249	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
L289248	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
L289247	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Where are my supplies?
L289225	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
L289224	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You said you had no whiskey.
L289223	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
L289041	u5909	m390	PAUL	I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
L289040	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
L289039	u5909	m390	PAUL	I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
L289038	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I will see what I can do.
L289037	u5909	m390	PAUL	The front gate would be best, General.
L289036	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
L289035	u5909	m390	PAUL	?Well rewarded? Those were his words.
L289034	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	He did.
L289033	u5909	m390	PAUL	I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
L289032	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The police are very busy.
L289031	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
L289026	u5909	m390	PAUL	Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
L289025	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ?we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.? What do you think would have happened? No different.
L289024	u5909	m390	PAUL	'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
L289023	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The high command? Our high command?
L289022	u5909	m390	PAUL	The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
L289021	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	And what will they do with these satellites?
L289020	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
L289019	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Satellites?
L289018	u5909	m390	PAUL	Satellites.
L289017	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Watch everything? How? They are gone.
L289016	u5909	m390	PAUL	The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
L289015	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	What did they say?
L289014	u5909	m390	PAUL	A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
L289013	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	What did you overhear?
L289012	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
L289011	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
L289010	u5909	m390	PAUL	The United Nations are still here.
L289009	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
L289008	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
L288436	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
L288435	u5909	m390	PAUL	It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
L288434	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
L289116	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Take the river road back. It is clear.
L289115	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let's go.
L289113	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Why not? We are half way there already.
L289112	u5909	m390	PAUL	) You cannot kill them all.
L289111	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
L289110	u5909	m390	PAUL	What do you mean George?
L289109	u5902	m390	GEORGE	No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
L289108	u5909	m390	PAUL	You have no whiskey?
L289107	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Beer yes, but no whiskey.
L289106	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
L289105	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
L288407	u5909	m390	PAUL	At least.
L288406	u5902	m390	GEORGE	A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
L288402	u5902	m390	GEORGE	I am always glad to see you Paul.
L288401	u5909	m390	PAUL	Very good.
L288400	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Business is good at the hotel?
L288399	u5909	m390	PAUL	Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
L288398	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Politics is power, Paul. And money.
L288397	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
L288914	u5903	m390	GLORIA	You?re drunk.
L288913	u5905	m390	JOCK	Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?

L288807	u5905	m390	JOCK	Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
L288806	u5903	m390	GLORIA	We?re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
L288805	u5905	m390	JOCK	For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
L288847	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank God.
L288846	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Very soon.
L288845	u5909	m390	PAUL	When will they be here?
L288844	u5903	m390	GLORIA	The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
L288580	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288579	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Good. I'd like to book a massage.
L288578	u5909	m390	PAUL	The fifth room is your broadcast room.
L288559	u5909	m390	PAUL	Just give me a moment to get your keys.
L288558	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Great, I really need a shower.
L289118	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	I saw the sign.
L289117	u5909	m390	PAUL	Are you sure this is the river road?
L289086	u5909	m390	PAUL	Just drive, Gregoire.
L289085	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	The fog is too heavy, sir.
L289084	u5909	m390	PAUL	For supplies, you drive.
L289083	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Where are we going, sir?
L289081	u5909	m390	PAUL	Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
L289080	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Please, except my humblest apologies...
L289079	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
L288779	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
L288778	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
L288777	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	I don't have to listen to you anymore.
L288776	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get out of this room and get back to work.
L288773	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire, what are you doing here?
L288772	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Mr. Manager.
L288566	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give me the phone.
L288565	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	There are no more rooms.
L288911	u5905	m390	JOCK	Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
L288910	u5909	m390	PAUL	This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
L288909	u5905	m390	JOCK	I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
L288908	u5909	m390	PAUL	I would never do that.
L288907	u5905	m390	JOCK	Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
L288841	u5909	m390	PAUL	This goes out live?
L288840	u5905	m390	JOCK	Perfect timing.
L288584	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
L288583	u5905	m390	JOCK	Can we phone them in, Paul?
L288582	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
L288581	u5905	m390	JOCK	Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
L288555	u5905	m390	JOCK	Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
L288554	u5909	m390	PAUL	Promoted. House Manager.
L288553	u5905	m390	JOCK	They moved you from the Diplomat?
L288552	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
L288551	u5905	m390	JOCK	Paul, how the hell are ya'?
L288975	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	I will remember that name.  Let's go.
L288974	u5909	m390	PAUL	Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
L288973	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Don't lie to me. What's your name?
L288972	u5909	m390	PAUL	Call, sir?
L288971	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Who did you call?
L288969	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
L288968	u5909	m390	PAUL	That will take time.
L288967	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
L288966	u5909	m390	PAUL	The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
L288965	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
L288928	u5909	m390	PAUL	I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
L288927	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	It's an order. Get everyone out now.
L288926	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why sir?
L288925	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Everyone must leave the hotel now.
L288924	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, sir. What is wrong?
L288923	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	You are the manager?
L289351	u5909	m390	PAUL	They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
L289350	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
L289102	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	One thousand francs.
L289101	u5909	m390	PAUL	How much?
L289100	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
L289099	u5909	m390	PAUL	You have our cards.
L289098	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What cards?
L289097	u5909	m390	PAUL	Our cards, please.
L289096	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What?
L289095	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me.
L289094	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	Show me your ID
L289093	u5909	m390	PAUL	He will be here.
L289092	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	The commander is not here.
L289091	u5909	m390	PAUL	We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
L289090	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What do you want?
L289172	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will give you my house.
L289171	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
L289170	u5909	m390	PAUL	How do you know?
L289169	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
L289168	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
L289167	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
L288863	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
L288862	u5909	m390	PAUL	Was there blood?
L288767	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	I will see what I can do.
L288766	u5909	m390	PAUL	This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
L288765	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
L288764	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
L288763	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need a great favor.
L288762	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
L289359	u5909	m390	PAUL	We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
L289358	u5915	m390	XAVIER	They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
L289286	u5909	m390	PAUL	They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
L289285	u5915	m390	XAVIER	This time the Militia will kill us.
L289003	u5909	m390	PAUL	Also, this is your bill for the last week.
L289002	u5915	m390	XAVIER	Pack the bags, we have to move.
L289001	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
L289000	u5915	m390	XAVIER	The third floor are low class rooms.
L288999	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm going to put you on the third floor.
L288998	u5915	m390	XAVIER	Move? Where to?
L288997	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm afraid you will have to move room.
L288784	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288783	u5915	m390	XAVIER	I will need a suite.
L289371	u5909	m390	PAUL	Anais, it is so good to see you.
L289370	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Oh, my babies.
L289298	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to go to the Diplomat.
L289297	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What's wrong?
L289296	u5909	m390	PAUL	The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
L289267	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
L289266	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please do not talk like this.
L289265	u5909	m390	PAUL	Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
L289264	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What sort of plan?
L289263	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to have a plan.
L289261	u5909	m390	PAUL	We are almost out of everything.
L289260	u5914	m390	TATIANA	We are almost out of water.
L289213	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul! Then another voice.
L289212	u5909	m390	PAUL	I love you. Keep the children safe.
L289211	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
L289210	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Let me go. Children get off.
L289208	u5909	m390	PAUL	I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
L289207	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No! Sit down now.
L289206	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to stay.
L289204	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No.
L289203	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get on the truck, Tatiana.
L289202	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
L289192	u5909	m390	PAUL	We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
L289191	u5914	m390	TATIANA	A little longer, Paul?
L289166	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
L289165	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, please try one more time.
L289164	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to get out of here Tatiana.
L289163	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I will not leave without the twins.
L289151	u5914	m390	TATIANA	A Volkswagen!
L289150	u5909	m390	PAUL	A Volkswagen.
L289149	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I want to know.
L289148	u5909	m390	PAUL	What does it matter.
L289147	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What sort of car?
L289146	u5909	m390	PAUL	A car.
L289145	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Tell me what it was.
L289144	u5909	m390	PAUL	It was substantial.
L289143	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
L289142	u5909	m390	PAUL	To be closer. So that I could marry you.
L289141	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Why?
L289140	u5909	m390	PAUL	I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
L289139	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What?
L289138	u5909	m390	PAUL	I had you transferred to Kigali.
L289137	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Yes.
L289136	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
L289135	u5914	m390	TATIANA	In Ruhengeri?
L289134	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have a confession. When we met...
L289132	u5909	m390	PAUL	A kiss.
L289131	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
L289130	u5909	m390	PAUL	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
L289129	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
L289078	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
L289077	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You cannot go alone.
L289076	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
L289075	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No, no.
L289074	u5909	m390	PAUL	To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
L289073	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Go out! Where?
L289072	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to go out to get food.
L289070	u5909	m390	PAUL	We're running out of beer and other supplies.
L289069	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What's the matter?
L289068	u5909	m390	PAUL	Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
L289067	u5914	m390	TATIANA	So where is the lamb?
L289066	u5909	m390	PAUL	Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
L288936	u5909	m390	PAUL	Do as I say. I will be there soon.
L288935	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What for Paul.
L288934	u5909	m390	PAUL	Go to the roof now.
L288922	u5909	m390	PAUL	Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
L288921	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
L288920	u5909	m390	PAUL	What are you saying, Tatsi?
L288919	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You could leave, Paul.
L288897	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
L288896	u5914	m390	TATIANA	But who is left?
L288895	u5909	m390	PAUL	Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
L288893	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have been abandoned.
L288892	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What about us?
L288891	u5909	m390	PAUL	They are being evacuated.
L288870	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. They are not dead. Stop this.
L288869	u5914	m390	TATIANA	My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
L288866	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please go back, bring the children to us.
L288865	u5909	m390	PAUL	This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
L288836	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give him time.
L288835	u5914	m390	TATIANA	He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
L288834	u5909	m390	PAUL	How can we help him.
L288833	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No, Odette says he's in shock.
L288832	u5909	m390	PAUL	Has Roger spoken yet?
L288761	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll try.
L288760	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
L288759	u5909	m390	PAUL	Any luck?
L288758	u5914	m390	TATIANA	It will do just fine.
L288757	u5909	m390	PAUL	This won't do.
L288746	u5909	m390	PAUL	Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
L288745	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
L288744	u5909	m390	PAUL	What!
L288743	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
L288742	u5909	m390	PAUL	Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
L288706	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get in.
L288705	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul, don't let them die.
L288655	u5909	m390	PAUL	Stay with the children.
L288654	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What is it, Paul.
L288640	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are you hurt, son?
L288639	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Oh, my God!
L288632	u5909	m390	PAUL	Dawn. Then they go.
L288631	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, Paul, 'til first light.
L288630	u5909	m390	PAUL	They know you are Tutsi!
L288629	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
L288628	u5909	m390	PAUL	Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
L288627	u5914	m390	TATIANA	They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
L288626	u5909	m390	PAUL	Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
L288623	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I tried already. The phones do not work.
L288622	u5909	m390	PAUL	I sent them home. Go and call them.
L288621	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Where are Thomas and Fedens?
L288618	u5909	m390	PAUL	Murdered! By whom?
L288617	u5914	m390	TATIANA	The president has been murdered.
L288614	u5909	m390	PAUL	Jean Baptiste!
L288613	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
L288547	u5909	m390	PAUL	"Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think ""Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody."" Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment."
L288546	u5914	m390	TATIANA	They do not have your connections.
L288545	u5909	m390	PAUL	He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
L288544	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
L288543	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
L288542	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You could have asked for a favor.
L288541	u5909	m390	PAUL	I couldn't help.
L288540	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
L288536	u5914	m390	TATIANA	We must do something.
L288535	u5909	m390	PAUL	No.
L288533	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, be quiet.
L288532	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
L288531	u5909	m390	PAUL	What?
L288530	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Do something.
L288509	u5909	m390	PAUL	Homework?
L288508	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
L288492	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Of course.
L288491	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let's have dinner first.
L288490	u5914	m390	TATIANA	He wants your wisdom.
L288489	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thomas wants advice?
L288483	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Yes, with Fedens and the children.
L288482	u5909	m390	PAUL	Your brother's here?
L288481	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
L288480	u5909	m390	PAUL	Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
L288983	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
L288982	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why?
L288981	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
L288980	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
L288979	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
L288818	u5909	m390	PAUL	There is one thing I need right away.
L288817	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
L288815	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
L288814	u5909	m390	PAUL	Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
L288813	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Can I have your name again?
L289236	u5916	m390	ZOZO	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
L289235	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is this about no water?
L289221	u5916	m390	ZOZO	As the trucks go.
L289220	u5909	m390	PAUL	When?
L289219	u5916	m390	ZOZO	I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
L289189	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
L289188	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Thank you, sir.
L289187	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
L289030	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Many beers.
L289029	u5909	m390	PAUL	How much beer?
L289028	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
L289027	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where has all our beer gone?
L288962	u5916	m390	ZOZO	The lieutenant wants the register.
L288961	u5909	m390	PAUL	What are you doing?
L288918	u5909	m390	PAUL	Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
L288917	u5916	m390	ZOZO	What do we do with all these people?
L288812	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
L288811	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
L288771	u5909	m390	PAUL	What! Paul storms off.
L288770	u5916	m390	ZOZO	He has taken the presidential suite.
L288769	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
L288423	u5909	m390	PAUL	How dead?
L288422	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Twelve are dead.
L288411	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
L288410	u5909	m390	PAUL	Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
L288389	u5909	m390	PAUL	Many times.
L288388	u5916	m390	ZOZO	You have taken business class?
L288387	u5909	m390	PAUL	Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
L288386	u5916	m390	ZOZO	That is why they call it coach?
L288385	u5909	m390	PAUL	It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
L288384	u5916	m390	ZOZO	What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
L288383	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
L288382	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
L288381	u5909	m390	PAUL	What's wrong?
L288380	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Rutaganda's place?
L288960	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
L288959	u5909	m390	PAUL	The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
L288958	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
L288957	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, thank you Mr. President.
L288956	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, are you there?
L288953	u5909	m390	PAUL	Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
L288952	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	The staff and guests! How many?
L288951	u5909	m390	PAUL	The staff, the guests.
L288950	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	All. What do you mean all?
L288949	u5909	m390	PAUL	I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
L288948	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Out? Where are you going?
L288947	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
L288946	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul. Are you alright?
L288527	u5912	m390	ROGER	On the street.
L288526	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where?
L288525	u5912	m390	ROGER	There are soldiers.
L288507	u5909	m390	PAUL	Who is this Simon?
L288506	u5912	m390	ROGER	Please, papa, I have a secret path.
L288505	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, I don't want you going on the street.
L288504	u5912	m390	ROGER	Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
L288503	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why the hurry, Roger?
L288502	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank you, Roger.
L288501	u5912	m390	ROGER	For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
L288753	u5909	m390	PAUL	Go downstairs, I will help you.
L288752	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	I don't know.
L288751	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is his room number?
L288750	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
L288749	u5909	m390	PAUL	Can I help you?
L288748	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	Moses, Moses Seradungu.
L293229	u5946	m394	ANNA	Guards come exactly every three minutes....
L293228	u5943	m394	ALEX	Eighth room down, babe...
L293219	u5946	m394	ANNA	Gum.
L293218	u5943	m394	ALEX	Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
L293211	u5946	m394	ANNA	It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
L293210	u5943	m394	ALEX	The security's actually not that severe.
L293197	u5943	m394	ALEX	I laughed, I cried.
L293196	u5946	m394	ANNA	That was beautiful.
L293190	u5946	m394	ANNA	Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
L293189	u5943	m394	ALEX	Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
L293188	u5946	m394	ANNA	Something like that.
L293187	u5943	m394	ALEX	You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
L293175	u5943	m394	ALEX	It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
L293174	u5946	m394	ANNA	Oh thank God, you're dead...
L293303	u5943	m394	ALEX	Get em....
L293302	u5951	m394	HAWK	Let's just forget it, I mean...
L293301	u5943	m394	ALEX	Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
L293281	u5951	m394	HAWK	You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
L293280	u5943	m394	ALEX	I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
L293279	u5951	m394	HAWK	Alex, are you....
L293262	u5951	m394	HAWK	I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
L293261	u5943	m394	ALEX	I'm a ghost.  Boo.
L293254	u5943	m394	ALEX	"But we'll be the same as we started...
L293253	u5951	m394	HAWK	We all had our quarrels and parted..."""
L293249	u5951	m394	HAWK	You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
L293248	u5943	m394	ALEX	Anna, I think you better stay....
L293247	u5951	m394	HAWK	That was close....
L293243	u5943	m394	ALEX	How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt
L293242	u5951	m394	HAWK	Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt
L293236	u5951	m394	HAWK	Don't worry, we'll get it...
L293235	u5943	m394	ALEX	Now that's a lock.
L293232	u5943	m394	ALEX	Maybe we're ragged and funny.
L293231	u5951	m394	HAWK	"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
L293222	u5951	m394	HAWK	Okay.
L293221	u5943	m394	ALEX	Why not just go now?
L293220	u5951	m394	HAWK	Count of three?
L293214	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
L293213	u5943	m394	ALEX	You sound disappointed.
L293212	u5951	m394	HAWK	Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was Who Shot J.R.?"""
L293206	u5951	m394	HAWK	Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
L293205	u5943	m394	ALEX	We're going in from the ground floor.
L293199	u5943	m394	ALEX	Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
L293198	u5951	m394	HAWK	Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
L293179	u5943	m394	ALEX	Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
L293178	u5951	m394	HAWK	No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
L293177	u5943	m394	ALEX	But I said I was sorry....
L293176	u5951	m394	HAWK	You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
L292888	u5951	m394	HAWK	Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
L292887	u5943	m394	ALEX	You re not thinking of going to...
L292886	u5951	m394	HAWK	Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
L292885	u5943	m394	ALEX	Why try?
L292884	u5951	m394	HAWK	Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
L292883	u5951	m394	HAWK	Attempted.  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
L292882	u5943	m394	ALEX	"Morning edition.  Seems two thieves ""attempted"" to steal it last night, but thanks to three ""courageous"" guards, it will be ready for tonight."
L292881	u5951	m394	HAWK	Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
L292880	u5943	m394	ALEX	"Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's ""Sforza,"" an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things."
L292879	u5951	m394	HAWK	The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
L292878	u5943	m394	ALEX	Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
L292877	u5951	m394	HAWK	Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
L292876	u5943	m394	ALEX	Did I miss anything?
L292846	u5951	m394	HAWK	Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
L292845	u5943	m394	ALEX	You could be swinging on a star.
L292844	u5951	m394	HAWK	What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
L292843	u5943	m394	ALEX	"The song's over!  Come on! ""You could be swinging on a star."""
L292840	u5943	m394	ALEX	Every day you meet quite a few.
L292839	u5951	m394	HAWK	And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo.
L292835	u5951	m394	HAWK	And though he's slippery, he still gets caught.
L292834	u5943	m394	ALEX	He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought.
L292827	u5943	m394	ALEX	"He kicks up at anything he hears.
L292826	u5951	m394	HAWK	A mule is an animal with long funny ears."""
L292825	u5943	m394	ALEX	You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
L292824	u5951	m394	HAWK	"5:32.  ""Swinging on a Star."""
L292823	u5943	m394	ALEX	You got about five minutes and change.
L292820	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
L292819	u5943	m394	ALEX	They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
L292818	u5943	m394	ALEX	No need.  Guards' station's right there.
L292817	u5951	m394	HAWK	Cameras?
L292816	u5943	m394	ALEX	Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
L292815	u5951	m394	HAWK	Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
L292811	u5943	m394	ALEX	"Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  ""Witchcraft."" What's the running time?"
L292810	u5951	m394	HAWK	Alex!
L292809	u5943	m394	ALEX	Rutherford Auction... that name...
L292808	u5951	m394	HAWK	I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
L292807	u5951	m394	HAWK	You're not...LISTENING!
L292806	u5943	m394	ALEX	There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
L292805	u5951	m394	HAWK	This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
L292804	u5943	m394	ALEX	Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
L292803	u5951	m394	HAWK	But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
L292802	u5943	m394	ALEX	Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
L292801	u5951	m394	HAWK	The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
L292800	u5943	m394	ALEX	Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
L292799	u5951	m394	HAWK	It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
L292798	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
L292797	u5943	m394	ALEX	Hmmmm.....
L292794	u5943	m394	ALEX	Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
L292793	u5951	m394	HAWK	Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
L292768	u5943	m394	ALEX	Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
L292767	u5951	m394	HAWK	I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
L292766	u5943	m394	ALEX	"I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us ""Watering Hole of the Month.""  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper."
L292765	u5951	m394	HAWK	Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
L292764	u5943	m394	ALEX	Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
L292763	u5951	m394	HAWK	Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
L292762	u5943	m394	ALEX	So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
L292760	u5943	m394	ALEX	Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
L292759	u5951	m394	HAWK	Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
L292758	u5943	m394	ALEX	Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
L292757	u5951	m394	HAWK	Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
L292756	u5943	m394	ALEX	Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
L292755	u5951	m394	HAWK	Three minutes, 51 seconds.
L292754	u5943	m394	ALEX	"Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  ""Come Fly with Me."""

L292751	u5943	m394	ALEX	Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
L292750	u5951	m394	HAWK	Looks like you've been expanding your...
L292748	u5943	m394	ALEX	Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
L292747	u5951	m394	HAWK	Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
L292746	u5943	m394	ALEX	That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
L293354	u5951	m394	HAWK	Ooh-kay...
L293353	u5944	m394	ALFRED	My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
L293352	u5951	m394	HAWK	You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
L293351	u5944	m394	ALFRED	How.
L293324	u5951	m394	HAWK	Last rites, sister?
L293323	u5944	m394	ALFRED	Welcome back to Vinci.
L292954	u5944	m394	ALFRED	It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
L292953	u5951	m394	HAWK	My life is not some deal.  I...
L292948	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yes way.
L292947	u5944	m394	ALFRED	Welcome to Rome, sir.
L292875	u5951	m394	HAWK	Too-do-loo, babe.
L292874	u5944	m394	ALFRED	Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
L293204	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
L293203	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
L293109	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
L293108	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
L293035	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
L293034	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
L292932	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
L292931	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
L292930	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Don't you just hate kids...
L293260	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	You're supposed to be dead!
L293259	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	What the hell....
L293246	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
L293245	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
L293055	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
L293054	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
L293053	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	"Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word ""Fuck"" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on ""America's Funniest Home Videos."""
L293052	u5945	m394	ALMOND JOY	Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
L293051	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
L293149	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	God go with you, sister.
L293148	u5946	m394	ANNA	"I know, I know, your Eminence, just say ""God go with me."""
L293147	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
L293146	u5946	m394	ANNA	I'm going to find out.
L293145	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
L293144	u5946	m394	ANNA	You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
L293142	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
L293141	u5946	m394	ANNA	A little petting is not the issue!
L293140	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Messed around messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
L293139	u5946	m394	ANNA	He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
L293138	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Anna, what are you trying to say...
L293137	u5946	m394	ANNA	I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
L293136	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Hit me with your best shot.
L293021	u5946	m394	ANNA	Yeah.  The big E.
L293020	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
L293019	u5946	m394	ANNA	"That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said ""Polite conversation is rarely either."""
L293018	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
L293017	u5946	m394	ANNA	No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
L293016	u5947	m394	CARDINAL	Did he mention the Mayflowers?
L293365	u5951	m394	HAWK	I got my planet back.
L293364	u5946	m394	ANNA	Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
L293363	u5951	m394	HAWK	Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
L293348	u5946	m394	ANNA	Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
L293347	u5951	m394	HAWK	I wanna know...
L293346	u5946	m394	ANNA	Wha -- you don't want to know...
L293345	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
L293344	u5946	m394	ANNA	Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
L293342	u5951	m394	HAWK	Wha.....
L293341	u5946	m394	ANNA	Trust Leonardo....
L293340	u5951	m394	HAWK	I hope you know what....
L293322	u5951	m394	HAWK	This is too bad to be false.
L293321	u5946	m394	ANNA	Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
L293320	u5951	m394	HAWK	I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
L293319	u5946	m394	ANNA	Oh Hudson...
L293209	u5951	m394	HAWK	Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.
L293208	u5946	m394	ANNA	Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
L293207	u5951	m394	HAWK	Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
L293194	u5946	m394	ANNA	"You re not ""some guy"" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I...."
L293193	u5951	m394	HAWK	Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
L293192	u5946	m394	ANNA	It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
L293191	u5951	m394	HAWK	You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
L293186	u5946	m394	ANNA	It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
L293185	u5951	m394	HAWK	You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
L293184	u5946	m394	ANNA	Where did you get this?
L293183	u5951	m394	HAWK	Oh.  Well, what's this?
L293182	u5946	m394	ANNA	I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
L293181	u5951	m394	HAWK	And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
L293180	u5946	m394	ANNA	Hudson, don't you understand...
L293091	u5946	m394	ANNA	Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
L293090	u5951	m394	HAWK	This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
L293088	u5951	m394	HAWK	Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
L293087	u5946	m394	ANNA	The C.I. what?  God, no...
L293086	u5951	m394	HAWK	Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
L293085	u5946	m394	ANNA	"For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the ""gas leak"" that supposedly destroyed it."
L293079	u5946	m394	ANNA	What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
L293078	u5951	m394	HAWK	Wha--
L293077	u5946	m394	ANNA	You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
L293076	u5951	m394	HAWK	It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
L293075	u5951	m394	HAWK	Oh.  No.
L293074	u5946	m394	ANNA	Somebody robbed the Vatican.
L293073	u5951	m394	HAWK	Catholic girls are scary...
L293072	u5946	m394	ANNA	It's also been a long time for me.  I--
L293071	u5951	m394	HAWK	Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
L293070	u5946	m394	ANNA	I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
L293069	u5946	m394	ANNA	Oh, I'm so sorry...

L293066	u5946	m394	ANNA	What have you been doing?
L293062	u5951	m394	HAWK	I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
L293061	u5946	m394	ANNA	"Wow, you were ""in the joint."" ""Doing hard time.""  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners."
L293060	u5951	m394	HAWK	Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
L293059	u5946	m394	ANNA	How long were you in?
L293058	u5951	m394	HAWK	I was the Warden?
L293057	u5946	m394	ANNA	Prison?
L293056	u5951	m394	HAWK	This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
L293047	u5951	m394	HAWK	I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
L293046	u5946	m394	ANNA	Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
L293013	u5951	m394	HAWK	Said.
L293012	u5946	m394	ANNA	Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
L293011	u5951	m394	HAWK	And I'll bring my entourage...
L293010	u5946	m394	ANNA	I'll bring my entire repertoire...
L293009	u5951	m394	HAWK	God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
L293008	u5946	m394	ANNA	I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
L293007	u5951	m394	HAWK	You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
L293006	u5946	m394	ANNA	Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
L293005	u5951	m394	HAWK	Oh, you read that.
L293004	u5946	m394	ANNA	Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
L293003	u5951	m394	HAWK	The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
L293002	u5946	m394	ANNA	Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
L293001	u5951	m394	HAWK	Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
L293000	u5951	m394	HAWK	Could you believe that crazy elephant?
L292999	u5946	m394	ANNA	Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
L292998	u5951	m394	HAWK	Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
L292997	u5951	m394	HAWK	Never, why do you ask?
L292996	u5946	m394	ANNA	Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
L292992	u5946	m394	ANNA	Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
L292991	u5951	m394	HAWK	That's what you theenk.
L292990	u5946	m394	ANNA	As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
L292989	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
L292988	u5946	m394	ANNA	Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
L292916	u5951	m394	HAWK	Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
L292915	u5946	m394	ANNA	Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
L292914	u5951	m394	HAWK	Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
L292913	u5946	m394	ANNA	"No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of ""watch out, Anna"" would have done nicely..."
L292912	u5951	m394	HAWK	Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
L292911	u5946	m394	ANNA	My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
L292900	u5946	m394	ANNA	Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
L292899	u5951	m394	HAWK	Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
L293103	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Actually he never told us what it was.
L293102	u5946	m394	ANNA	Cat got his tongue?
L293101	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
L293100	u5946	m394	ANNA	"Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some ""neat"" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool."
L293099	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
L293097	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
L293096	u5946	m394	ANNA	When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
L293095	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Way to go, Anna.
L292857	u5951	m394	HAWK	Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
L292856	u5948	m394	CESAR	Good job, not pretty, but good.
L292741	u5951	m394	HAWK	Baseball, why?
L292740	u5948	m394	CESAR	What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
L292739	u5951	m394	HAWK	If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
L292738	u5948	m394	CESAR	Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
L292736	u5951	m394	HAWK	Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
L292735	u5948	m394	CESAR	You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
L292734	u5951	m394	HAWK	Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
L292733	u5948	m394	CESAR	"How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, ""endearing."""
L293298	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Million five, lover...
L293297	u5949	m394	DARWIN	That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
L293296	u5953	m394	MINERVA	I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
L293241	u5949	m394	DARWIN	So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
L293240	u5953	m394	MINERVA	We're here to say, your government was right.
L293239	u5949	m394	DARWIN	I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
L293157	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
L293156	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
L293155	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
L293151	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
L293150	u5949	m394	DARWIN	So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
L293117	u5949	m394	DARWIN	I don't care.
L293116	u5953	m394	MINERVA	No, let me!
L293114	u5953	m394	MINERVA	"Like a ""cat"", one could say."
L293113	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
L292974	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
L292973	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
L292972	u5953	m394	MINERVA	We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
L292968	u5953	m394	MINERVA	That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
L292967	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
L292906	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
L292905	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
L293287	u5951	m394	HAWK	But you're going to tell us anyway...
L293286	u5949	m394	DARWIN	What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
L293161	u5951	m394	HAWK	You want an address on that last one?
L293160	u5949	m394	DARWIN	I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
L293131	u5951	m394	HAWK	Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
L293130	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
L292963	u5951	m394	HAWK	I guess that's a no.
L292962	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
L292961	u5951	m394	HAWK	"If you're pausing for a ""thank you,"" give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?"
L292960	u5949	m394	DARWIN	"Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the ""Sforza"" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out...."
L292959	u5951	m394	HAWK	Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
L292958	u5949	m394	DARWIN	So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
L292951	u5949	m394	DARWIN	Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
L292950	u5951	m394	HAWK	You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
L292949	u5949	m394	DARWIN	For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
L292860	u5950	m394	GATES	So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
L292859	u5951	m394	HAWK	You certainly do.
L292858	u5950	m394	GATES	All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
L292855	u5951	m394	HAWK	Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
L292854	u5950	m394	GATES	Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
L292790	u5950	m394	GATES	That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
L292789	u5951	m394	HAWK	What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
L292787	u5951	m394	HAWK	Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
L292786	u5950	m394	GATES	Remember that shoe you lost...
L292785	u5951	m394	HAWK	Yes.
L292784	u5950	m394	GATES	Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
L292783	u5951	m394	HAWK	"How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying ""Soitinly."""
L292782	u5950	m394	GATES	You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
L292781	u5951	m394	HAWK	The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
L292780	u5950	m394	GATES	The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
L292779	u5951	m394	HAWK	What job?
L292778	u5950	m394	GATES	Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
L292777	u5951	m394	HAWK	The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
L292776	u5950	m394	GATES	Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
L293337	u5953	m394	MINERVA	I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
L293336	u5951	m394	HAWK	And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
L293335	u5953	m394	MINERVA	If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
L293333	u5953	m394	MINERVA	"You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say ""How could this happen to me?""  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!"
L293332	u5951	m394	HAWK	Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
L293331	u5953	m394	MINERVA	It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
L293330	u5951	m394	HAWK	You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
L293289	u5951	m394	HAWK	If you think you're getting past me...
L293288	u5953	m394	MINERVA	I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
L293163	u5953	m394	MINERVA	You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
L293162	u5951	m394	HAWK	Bunny, not you too?
L293159	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
L293158	u5951	m394	HAWK	Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
L293154	u5951	m394	HAWK	Alchemy.
L293153	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
L293133	u5951	m394	HAWK	Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
L293132	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
L293123	u5951	m394	HAWK	Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
L293122	u5953	m394	MINERVA	Get away from there, convict!
L292978	u5951	m394	HAWK	You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.
L292977	u5953	m394	MINERVA	"You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but ""Alex"" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing."
L292976	u5951	m394	HAWK	Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
L292970	u5953	m394	MINERVA	For God's sake, chain this convict.
L292969	u5951	m394	HAWK	Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
L293295	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	Too bad.
L293294	u5951	m394	HAWK	Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
L293292	u5951	m394	HAWK	Just shut up and hit me!
L293291	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	Bastard!  If you were a true American.
L293290	u5951	m394	HAWK	Don't be stupid...they...
L293033	u5951	m394	HAWK	Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
L293032	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
L293031	u5951	m394	HAWK	You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
L292926	u5954	m394	SNICKERS	When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
L292925	u5951	m394	HAWK	This is the worst night...
L293311	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Tell me about it...
L293310	u5951	m394	HAWK	Why does this have to be so hard...
L293276	u5951	m394	HAWK	No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
L293275	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	"I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say ""I'm just in this job for the money.""  Sad. Any last immature quips?"
L293271	u5951	m394	HAWK	I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
L293270	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
L293269	u5951	m394	HAWK	Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
L293039	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
L293038	u5951	m394	HAWK	If you do anything to my friend...
L293037	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
L293036	u5951	m394	HAWK	Thanks for sharing.
L293028	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
L293027	u5951	m394	HAWK	Why George, you big softie...
L293026	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
L292945	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Shucks.  Guess not.
L292944	u5951	m394	HAWK	I'm supposed to fall for that?
L292943	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
L292942	u5951	m394	HAWK	Employer?  The president?
L292941	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
L292940	u5951	m394	HAWK	Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
L292939	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	"I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, ""We've only just begun."""
L292938	u5951	m394	HAWK	To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
L292937	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
L292936	u5951	m394	HAWK	But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
L292935	u5951	m394	HAWK	Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
L292934	u5952	m394	KAPLAN	You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
L292933	u5951	m394	HAWK	Don't I know you...
L329192	u6149	m409	GRANT	A bird cage.
L329191	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What is it?
L329190	u6149	m409	GRANT	Oh, my God.
L329179	u6149	m409	GRANT	One way to find out.
L329178	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Do you think it goes all the way across?
L329079	u6149	m409	GRANT	This is how you play God.
L329078	u6145	m409	AMANDA	This is how you make dinosaurs?
L329015	u6149	m409	GRANT	Quiet!
L329014	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric!
L328983	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
L328982	u6149	m409	GRANT	After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
L328980	u6149	m409	GRANT	A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
L328979	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
L328931	u6149	m409	GRANT	And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
L328930	u6145	m409	AMANDA	ERRR-IIIC!
L329293	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I would completely support that.
L329292	u6150	m409	PAUL	Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
L329272	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
L329271	u6150	m409	PAUL	You mean it?
L329270	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We should try fishing again.
L329216	u6145	m409	AMANDA	But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
L329215	u6150	m409	PAUL	He could have died.
L329214	u6145	m409	AMANDA	How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
L329213	u6150	m409	PAUL	I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
L329212	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You couldn't have made that jump.
L329211	u6150	m409	PAUL	My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
L329197	u6150	m409	PAUL	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
L329196	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
L329184	u6150	m409	PAUL	We're not going anywhere, I promise.
L329183	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
L329163	u6150	m409	PAUL	Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
L329162	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
L329160	u6150	m409	PAUL	I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
L329159	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What?...WHAT!?
L329157	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Think.
L329156	u6150	m409	PAUL	I don't remember
L329155	u6145	m409	AMANDA	When did you have it last?
L329154	u6150	m409	PAUL	I don't know. I don't have it with me.
L329134	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
L329133	u6150	m409	PAUL	That one time was just the bumper.
L329132	u6145	m409	AMANDA	This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
L329131	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it?s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
L329130	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Well what?
L329124	u6150	m409	PAUL	I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
L329123	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
L329092	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We have to help him.
L329091	u6150	m409	PAUL	It's not safe.
L329090	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's this way.
L329089	u6150	m409	PAUL	Udesky.
L329074	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric!
L329073	u6150	m409	PAUL	Eric! Are you here?
L329056	u6145	m409	AMANDA	It?s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
L329055	u6150	m409	PAUL	I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
L329054	u6145	m409	AMANDA	No, it's...
L329053	u6150	m409	PAUL	I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
L329042	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I filmed this the morning they left.
L329041	u6150	m409	PAUL	That's him. That?s Eric!
L329032	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Eric...
L329031	u6150	m409	PAUL	Young adult.
L329029	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Just drop it Paul!
L329028	u6150	m409	PAUL	What did you say!
L329027	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Nothing.
L329026	u6150	m409	PAUL	What did you say?
L329025	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Nothing.
L329024	u6150	m409	PAUL	What?
L329023	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Oh, don't worry about that.
L329022	u6150	m409	PAUL	Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
L329021	u6145	m409	AMANDA	"Because ""Dr. Grant"" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast."
L329020	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
L329019	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
L329018	u6150	m409	PAUL	No, Dr. Grant says...
L329017	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
L329016	u6150	m409	PAUL	Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
L328997	u6145	m409	AMANDA	So do you.
L328996	u6150	m409	PAUL	You look good.
L328995	u6150	m409	PAUL	People change.
L328994	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You hate to swim.
L328993	u6150	m409	PAUL	Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
L328992	u6145	m409	AMANDA	How much weight have you lost?
L328991	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Nothing you haven't seen before.
L328990	u6150	m409	PAUL	Sorry.
L328970	u6150	m409	PAUL	"We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should ""accept the inevitable."" You believe that?"
L328969	u6145	m409	AMANDA	A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
L328968	u6150	m409	PAUL	Her new boyfriend.
L328943	u6150	m409	PAUL	Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
L328942	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We can't just...
L328935	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What's a bad idea?
L328934	u6150	m409	PAUL	He says it's a bad idea!
L328933	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What?
L328932	u6150	m409	PAUL	Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
L328891	u6145	m409	AMANDA	From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
L328890	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
L328884	u6150	m409	PAUL	We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
L328883	u6145	m409	AMANDA	...once-in-a-lifetime.
L328880	u6145	m409	AMANDA	We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
L328879	u6150	m409	PAUL	Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
L328877	u6145	m409	AMANDA	It is truly, what?s the word? Inspiring.
L328876	u6150	m409	PAUL	First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
L329153	u6146	m409	BILLY	Where is it?
L329152	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You had the phone the whole time?
L329148	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What about Eric?
L329147	u6146	m409	BILLY	Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that?s where he's headed.
L329146	u6145	m409	AMANDA	What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
L329145	u6146	m409	BILLY	We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
L329094	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's not a kill, he's still alive.
L329093	u6146	m409	BILLY	He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
L329067	u6146	m409	BILLY	Here!
L329066	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
L328967	u6146	m409	BILLY	Who's that?
L328966	u6145	m409	AMANDA	He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
L328889	u6146	m409	BILLY	How low?
L328888	u6145	m409	AMANDA	You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
L329263	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
L329262	u6148	m409	ERIC	He loves you too.
L329261	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
L329260	u6148	m409	ERIC	then we should...
L329259	u6145	m409	AMANDA	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
L329258	u6148	m409	ERIC	We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
L329256	u6145	m409	AMANDA	Just hold on.
L329255	u6148	m409	ERIC	Where's Dad?
L329253	u6148	m409	ERIC	DAD!
L329252	u6145	m409	AMANDA	PAUL!
L329194	u6146	m409	BILLY	It won't hold!
L329193	u6150	m409	PAUL	Eric!
L329150	u6146	m409	BILLY	Sure.
L329149	u6150	m409	PAUL	He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
L329127	u6146	m409	BILLY	Dr. Grant was.
L329126	u6150	m409	PAUL	I thought you were an expert.
L329125	u6146	m409	BILLY	I don?t know.
L329096	u6146	m409	BILLY	They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
L329095	u6150	m409	PAUL	They couldn?t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
L329007	u6146	m409	BILLY	About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
L329006	u6150	m409	PAUL	Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
L329005	u6146	m409	BILLY	So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
L328978	u6150	m409	PAUL	I didn't know, there were two islands.
L328977	u6146	m409	BILLY	That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
L329202	u6146	m409	BILLY	I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
L329201	u6149	m409	GRANT	NO!
L329200	u6146	m409	BILLY	I CAN GET HIM!
L329172	u6149	m409	GRANT	Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
L329171	u6146	m409	BILLY	You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
L329168	u6149	m409	GRANT	Billy, I can't talk to you now.
L329167	u6146	m409	BILLY	Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
L329166	u6149	m409	GRANT	We need to keep moving.
L329088	u6149	m409	GRANT	KEEP GOING!
L329087	u6146	m409	BILLY	ALAN!
L329071	u6149	m409	GRANT	Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
L329070	u6146	m409	BILLY	We could co-write a paper.
L329037	u6149	m409	GRANT	We should take it with us to signal any planes.
L329036	u6146	m409	BILLY	It looks intact.
L329004	u6149	m409	GRANT	That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
L329003	u6146	m409	BILLY	I don't remember that on InGen's list.
L329002	u6149	m409	GRANT	Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
L329001	u6146	m409	BILLY	Baryonyx?
L329000	u6149	m409	GRANT	They never got that big.
L328999	u6146	m409	BILLY	Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
L328998	u6149	m409	GRANT	How would you classify it?
L328938	u6149	m409	GRANT	I don't think so.
L328937	u6146	m409	BILLY	Is it a rex?
L328914	u6149	m409	GRANT	Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
L328913	u6146	m409	BILLY	I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
L328902	u6149	m409	GRANT	The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
L328901	u6146	m409	BILLY	Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
L328900	u6149	m409	GRANT	Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
L328899	u6146	m409	BILLY	It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
L328898	u6149	m409	GRANT	That does sound lucky.
L328897	u6146	m409	BILLY	No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
L328896	u6149	m409	GRANT	Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
L328867	u6149	m409	GRANT	What?
L328866	u6146	m409	BILLY	They're here.
L328865	u6149	m409	GRANT	Absolutely not.
L328863	u6149	m409	GRANT	Not if it can't dig.
L328862	u6146	m409	BILLY	It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
L328861	u6149	m409	GRANT	You rented an automated litter box.
L328860	u6146	m409	BILLY	Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
L328859	u6149	m409	GRANT	We'll be broke in four weeks.
L328858	u6146	m409	BILLY	How was your trip? Profitable?
L328837	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
L328836	u6149	m409	GRANT	A well-accepted theory.
L328835	u6147	m409	ELLIE	When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
L328834	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Goodbye, Alan.
L328833	u6149	m409	GRANT	Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
L328832	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Let me know if I can help, Alan. You?re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
L328831	u6149	m409	GRANT	I'd better get going.
L328830	u6149	m409	GRANT	The last of my breed.
L328829	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
L328828	u6149	m409	GRANT	It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
L328827	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Good luck with the fund raising.
L328824	u6149	m409	GRANT	To a degree we never imagined.
L328823	u6147	m409	ELLIE	You think they could talk to each other?
L328822	u6149	m409	GRANT	We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
L328821	u6147	m409	ELLIE	I try not to.
L328820	u6149	m409	GRANT	You remember the sounds they made?
L328819	u6147	m409	ELLIE	My favorite.
L328818	u6149	m409	GRANT	Raptors, mostly.
L328817	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Anything good?
L328813	u6149	m409	GRANT	Really?  What do you do there?
L328812	u6147	m409	ELLIE	So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
L328809	u6147	m409	ELLIE	Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
L328808	u6149	m409	GRANT	He used to know me.
L328799	u6147	m409	ELLIE	He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
L328798	u6149	m409	GRANT	Hmm?
L329291	u6149	m409	GRANT	The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
L329290	u6148	m409	ERIC	What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
L329285	u6149	m409	GRANT	No we're not.
L329284	u6148	m409	ERIC	We're safe!
L329280	u6149	m409	GRANT	Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
L329279	u6148	m409	ERIC	No. I couldn't see.
L329278	u6149	m409	GRANT	Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
L329277	u6149	m409	GRANT	You're right.
L329276	u6148	m409	ERIC	You should.
L329275	u6149	m409	GRANT	It's strikes me now I never told her that.
L329274	u6149	m409	GRANT	She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
L329273	u6148	m409	ERIC	The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
L329236	u6148	m409	ERIC	Something must've scared them.
L329235	u6149	m409	GRANT	Bonitas.
L329223	u6149	m409	GRANT	Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
L329222	u6148	m409	ERIC	But then you never get to go in space.
L329221	u6149	m409	GRANT	See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
L329220	u6148	m409	ERIC	I want to be an astronaut.
L329219	u6149	m409	GRANT	I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
L329218	u6149	m409	GRANT	No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
L329217	u6148	m409	ERIC	Do you have any kids?
L329174	u6148	m409	ERIC	Then we go home?
L329173	u6149	m409	GRANT	We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
L329144	u6148	m409	ERIC	Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
L329143	u6149	m409	GRANT	Why?
L329142	u6148	m409	ERIC	Are you sure?
L329141	u6149	m409	GRANT	We need to head for the coast.
L329140	u6148	m409	ERIC	I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
L329139	u6149	m409	GRANT	How much of this island have you explored?
L329138	u6148	m409	ERIC	Mine's new.
L329137	u6149	m409	GRANT	A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
L329136	u6148	m409	ERIC	Know what this is?
L329121	u6148	m409	ERIC	I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
L329120	u6149	m409	GRANT	What did you think?
L329119	u6148	m409	ERIC	Yeah.
L329118	u6149	m409	GRANT	Did you read Malcolm's book?
L329117	u6149	m409	GRANT	The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
L329116	u6148	m409	ERIC	Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
L329115	u6149	m409	GRANT	It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
L329114	u6148	m409	ERIC	Found this, but the battery's dead.
L329113	u6149	m409	GRANT	Any weapons, radios?
L329112	u6148	m409	ERIC	When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
L329111	u6149	m409	GRANT	Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
L329110	u6148	m409	ERIC	The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
L329109	u6149	m409	GRANT	Which one do you prefer?
L329108	u6148	m409	ERIC	You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
L329107	u6149	m409	GRANT	You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
L329106	u6148	m409	ERIC	They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
L329105	u6149	m409	GRANT	On the island.
L329104	u6148	m409	ERIC	In Costa Rica?
L329103	u6149	m409	GRANT	Eric, your parents are both here.
L329232	u6150	m409	PAUL	Stan.
L329231	u6149	m409	GRANT	Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
L329230	u6150	m409	PAUL	Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
L329210	u6150	m409	PAUL	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
L329209	u6149	m409	GRANT	Billy!
L329082	u6149	m409	GRANT	Back out! Move!
L329081	u6150	m409	PAUL	Amanda!
L329064	u6149	m409	GRANT	But you never came across just one.
L329063	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well that's good.
L329009	u6150	m409	PAUL	"There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The ""plus"" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that."
L329008	u6149	m409	GRANT	There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
L328986	u6149	m409	GRANT	You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
L328985	u6150	m409	PAUL	Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
L328984	u6149	m409	GRANT	No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
L328976	u6150	m409	PAUL	Sure you have. You wrote that book...
L328975	u6149	m409	GRANT	I have never been on this island!
L328974	u6150	m409	PAUL	We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
L328929	u6149	m409	GRANT	Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
L328928	u6150	m409	PAUL	Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
L328927	u6149	m409	GRANT	What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
L328921	u6149	m409	GRANT	This plane can not land!
L328920	u6150	m409	PAUL	Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
L328893	u6150	m409	PAUL	Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
L328892	u6149	m409	GRANT	That's hard to believe.
L328887	u6149	m409	GRANT	I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can?t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
L328886	u6150	m409	PAUL	No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
L328885	u6149	m409	GRANT	That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
L328882	u6150	m409	PAUL	Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
L328881	u6149	m409	GRANT	Hmmm.
L328874	u6150	m409	PAUL	I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
L328873	u6149	m409	GRANT	You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
L328872	u6150	m409	PAUL	Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
L328871	u6149	m409	GRANT	What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
L330610	u6151	m410	AJAY	No.  I feel something.
L330609	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You hear something?
L330401	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
L330400	u6151	m410	AJAY	Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
L330376	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It certainly does.
L330375	u6151	m410	AJAY	It matches the pictures.
L330232	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
L330231	u6151	m410	AJAY	You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
L330230	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Sorry.  We were saying?
L330222	u6159	m410	ROLAND	A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
L330221	u6151	m410	AJAY	How do you mean?
L330220	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Just a little bit too much, I think.
L330219	u6151	m410	AJAY	But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
L330218	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
L330217	u6151	m410	AJAY	I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
L330216	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
L330215	u6151	m410	AJAY	You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
L330214	u6159	m410	ROLAND	That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
L330213	u6151	m410	AJAY	How did you know?
L330383	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
L330382	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
L330302	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
L330301	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there an antidote?
L330254	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
L330253	u6152	m410	EDDIE	It doesn't matter what I think.
L330252	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
L330251	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
L330250	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You are an academic.
L330249	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
L330248	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Minimal is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
L330247	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Minimal.
L330246	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Any damage?
L330197	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
L330196	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm not going, John.
L330194	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
L330193	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John . . .
L330192	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
L330191	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So what?
L330190	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
L330189	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
L330188	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
L330187	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
L330186	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
L330185	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't believe you.
L330184	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
L330183	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What are you talking about?
L330182	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
L330181	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330180	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
L330179	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
L330178	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
L330177	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't know you -- weren't well.
L330176	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
L330175	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Resentful.
L330533	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Everyone, keep your voices down!
L330532	u6158	m410	NICK	Are you looking for a problem?
L330395	u6158	m410	NICK	You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
L330394	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	But he's the head of InGen!
L330390	u6158	m410	NICK	Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
L330389	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
L330337	u6158	m410	NICK	-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
L330336	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
L330304	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	-- my --
L330303	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh --
L330324	u6160	m410	SARAH	We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
L330323	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
L330322	u6160	m410	SARAH	Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
L330321	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
L330320	u6160	m410	SARAH	And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
L330316	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
L330315	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
L330312	u6160	m410	SARAH	Not without a shot of the nest.
L330311	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
L330309	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I want to see the nesting ground!
L330308	u6160	m410	SARAH	That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
L330710	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Come on!
L330709	u6155	m410	KELLY	Dad!
L330526	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm fine... I'm fine...
L330525	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
L330524	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
L330425	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
L330424	u6155	m410	KELLY	What are you guys gonna do?
L330388	u6155	m410	KELLY	On the side of that one truck.
L330387	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where does it say that?
L330386	u6155	m410	KELLY	InGen.  What's InGen?
L330349	u6155	m410	KELLY	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
L330348	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	How could you possibly?
L330279	u6155	m410	KELLY	You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
L330278	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
L330277	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
L330276	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
L330275	u6155	m410	KELLY	I could come with you.
L330274	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That Richard.
L330273	u6155	m410	KELLY	No.  Richard talked to his parents.
L330272	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, is he?
L330271	u6155	m410	KELLY	That was about a year ago.
L330270	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
L330269	u6155	m410	KELLY	Which one?
L330268	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is that kid still bothering you?
L330267	u6155	m410	KELLY	No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
L330266	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
L330265	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
L330264	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
L330263	u6155	m410	KELLY	My vacation is over in a week.
L330262	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
L330261	u6155	m410	KELLY	Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
L330260	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
L330259	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't even know this woman.
L330258	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
L330256	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Kelly!  What are you doing here?
L330255	u6155	m410	KELLY	Hi, Dad.
L330677	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
L330676	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
L330675	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
L330674	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	It's... behind... us.
L330672	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why?
L330671	u6159	m410	ROLAND	We took to the rock.
L330662	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Possible.
L330661	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
L330650	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good.
L330649	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
L330644	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Operations building.  Far end of the street.
L330643	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Where's the power and radio setup?
L330637	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Piss.
L330636	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What is that?
L330550	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The velociraptors.
L330549	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What is?
L330450	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Isn't it obvious?
L330449	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What in Christ's name is going on?!
L330443	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
L330442	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You've broken its leg!
L330441	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
L330439	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
L330438	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What?
L330437	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
L330436	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
L330435	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
L330434	u6159	m410	ROLAND	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
L330433	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You rally think this'll draw the parent?
L330431	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
L330430	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
L330429	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	How close do you have to be?
L330428	u6159	m410	ROLAND	My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
L330427	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What kind of gun is that?
L330379	u6159	m410	ROLAND	To collect my fee.
L330378	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Where do you think you're going?!
L330364	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good lad.
L330363	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Okay.
L330362	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
L330361	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
L330360	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
L330359	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What?  Why?
L330358	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Cancel that, Dieter.
L330652	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Piss.
L330651	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What's he got in there?
L330210	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
L330209	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
L330208	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
L330207	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
L330206	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You version of it.
L330205	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
L330204	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
L330203	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
L330202	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
L330201	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
L330200	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
L330665	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
L330664	u6160	m410	SARAH	You're going too?
L330663	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You know how to work a radio, don't you?
L330654	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
L330653	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?
L330537	u6160	m410	SARAH	Oh, God.
L330536	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Their what?
L330529	u6160	m410	SARAH	Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
L330528	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
L330706	u6158	m410	NICK	Look!  Sarah!
L330705	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Something's wrong.
L330701	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
L330700	u6158	m410	NICK	I think she's with Sarah!
L330699	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I have to find Kelly!
L330698	u6158	m410	NICK	Head for the roof!
L330697	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
L330696	u6158	m410	NICK	It'll hold!
L330695	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
L330694	u6158	m410	NICK	"We're sure as hell not going back out there"""
L330693	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We can't stay in here!
L330691	u6158	m410	NICK	She's with Sarah!
L330690	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where's Kelly?
L330689	u6158	m410	NICK	Come on!
L330648	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't know.
L330647	u6158	m410	NICK	What are they?
L330646	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330645	u6158	m410	NICK	Lava?
L330501	u6158	m410	NICK	No way.
L330500	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330485	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What do you think they want?!
L330484	u6158	m410	NICK	What do they want?!
L330458	u6158	m410	NICK	No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
L330457	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
L330456	u6158	m410	NICK	It has a broken leg!
L330455	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	?!
L330423	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
L330422	u6158	m410	NICK	There' no reason for name calling.
L330420	u6158	m410	NICK	I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
L330419	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Our chance to do what?
L330418	u6158	m410	NICK	Then this is our chance.
L330345	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
L330344	u6158	m410	NICK	Do you see any family resemblance here?
L330326	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, my God.
L330325	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No way.
L330314	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	She's nuts.
L330313	u6158	m410	NICK	She's gutty.
L330667	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
L330666	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
L330631	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
L330630	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Four, counting the one in the chamber.
L330629	u6159	m410	ROLAND	How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
L330577	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
L330576	u6159	m410	ROLAND	"You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, ""why did you go up there to die?""  And he said ""I didn't.  I went up there to live."""
L330575	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	But why?
L330574	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
L330572	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
L330571	u6159	m410	ROLAND	So the truth is more important to you than your life?
L330570	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
L330569	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
L330568	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because it exists.
L330567	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why should they?
L330566	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So that others would know about this place?
L330565	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why did you come here?
L330564	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
L330563	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Feeling a bit blue, are we?
L330562	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
L330561	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What's that?
L330560	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
L330556	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
L330555	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
L330554	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
L330686	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Birdshit?
L330685	u6160	m410	SARAH	These formations.  They're dried --
L330684	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330683	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian.  It's guano.
L330590	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
L330589	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Maybe.  Maybe not.
L330588	u6160	m410	SARAH	You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
L330510	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They're pushing us over the cliff.
L330509	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?!
L330508	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Oh, God.
L330504	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
L330503	u6160	m410	SARAH	They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
L330502	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
L330492	u6160	m410	SARAH	I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
L330491	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you insane?!
L330490	u6160	m410	SARAH	Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
L330487	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
L330486	u6160	m410	SARAH	That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
L330470	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Think fast, Sarah.
L330469	u6160	m410	SARAH	It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
L330468	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Can you set up?
L330393	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John Hammond.
L330392	u6160	m410	SARAH	Funded by whom?
L330391	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
L330342	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm her father.
L330341	u6160	m410	SARAH	Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
L330340	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
L330335	u6160	m410	SARAH	What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
L330334	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
L330318	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
L330317	u6160	m410	SARAH	No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
L330712	u6160	m410	SARAH	Where's Ian?
L330711	u6158	m410	NICK	Where's Kelly?
L330621	u6158	m410	NICK	JUMP!
L330620	u6160	m410	SARAH	WHAT ARE YOU-
L330499	u6160	m410	SARAH	No.
L330498	u6158	m410	NICK	"There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One ""no"" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:"
L330479	u6158	m410	NICK	I'm trying!
L330478	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hold it down, Nick!
L330474	u6160	m410	SARAH	We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
L330473	u6158	m410	NICK	Give it more morphine!
L330467	u6160	m410	SARAH	That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
L330466	u6158	m410	NICK	That little black line?
L330385	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
L330384	u6158	m410	NICK	Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
L330351	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
L330350	u6158	m410	NICK	The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
L330328	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, no!
L330327	u6160	m410	SARAH	-- way we could safely --
L330293	u6160	m410	SARAH	I believe in him.
L330292	u6158	m410	NICK	He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
L330291	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian's a very good friend of mine.
L330290	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
L330289	u6160	m410	SARAH	You think this is all a joke?
L330288	u6158	m410	NICK	Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
L330287	u6160	m410	SARAH	Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
L330286	u6158	m410	NICK	Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
L330285	u6160	m410	SARAH	That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
L330284	u6158	m410	NICK	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
L330283	u6160	m410	SARAH	So what's your story, Nick?
L330660	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
L330659	u6160	m410	SARAH	You've got to be kidding.
L330633	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Can the kid walk?
L330632	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ask her.
L330600	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
L330599	u6160	m410	SARAH	We have to send someone to look for him!
L330543	u6160	m410	SARAH	Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
L330542	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
L330541	u6159	m410	ROLAND	None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
L330540	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
L332224	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
L332223	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
L332222	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
L332221	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
L332003	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Where did the vehicles stop?
L332002	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Phones are out too.
L331990	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The monitors are failing.
L331989	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
L331988	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
L331987	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What now?
L331986	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
L331975	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
L331974	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The door security systems are shutting down.
L331973	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What?
L331964	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
L331963	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
L331962	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
L331957	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
L331956	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
L331917	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Damn!
L331916	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
L331912	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It's not worth taking the chance, John.
L331911	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You're sure we have to?
L331910	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
L331879	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Stop the program!  Stop the program!
L331878	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
L332242	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	'Bout thirty seconds.
L332241	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How long will this take?
L332232	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
L332231	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How would we cut off the lysine?
L332230	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
L332226	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
L332225	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But would we get the phones back?
L332220	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
L332219	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
L332077	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
L332076	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - about two million.
L332075	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How many lines of code are there?
L332074	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What one?
L332073	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
L332072	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
L331626	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
L331625	u6162	m411	DODGSON	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
L331624	u6171	m411	NEDRY	That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
L331623	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
L331622	u6171	m411	NEDRY	What?  No menthol?
L331620	u6171	m411	NEDRY	How am I supposed to transport them?
L331619	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
L331618	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Oh, I'll get 'em all.
L331616	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
L331615	u6162	m411	DODGSON	You shouldn't use my name.
L331950	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
L331949	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
L331887	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
L331886	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
L331883	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
L331882	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
L331781	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
L331780	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
L331676	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Shhhhh!
L331675	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
L331952	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
L331951	u6167	m411	HARDING	Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
L331907	u6167	m411	HARDING	You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
L331906	u6163	m411	ELLIE	There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
L331905	u6167	m411	HARDING	Pretty sure.
L331904	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are you sure?
L331903	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
L331902	u6163	m411	ELLIE	That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
L331901	u6167	m411	HARDING	They are?  I'll be damned.
L331900	u6163	m411	ELLIE	These are dilated.  Take a look.
L331899	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
L331898	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Six weeks?
L331897	u6167	m411	HARDING	Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
L332312	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
L332311	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
L332310	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
L332286	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Look.
L332285	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
L332284	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why?
L332283	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But you know, I should  really be the one going .
L332274	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John....
L332273	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
L332192	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
L332191	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Once we have control again we - -
L332190	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
L332188	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
L332187	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
L332186	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	"A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  ""I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... "
L332185	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Carousel.
L332184	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
L332183	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
L331747	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
L331746	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
L331744	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
L331743	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.
L331742	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Fascinating animals, fascinating.
L331714	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Could I have a tissue please?
L331713	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.
L331712	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	There you are.  Out you come.
L331598	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
L331597	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I have samples all over the kitchen. 
L331596	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
L331595	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Did I say jerk?
L332361	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
L332360	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
L332359	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You can't hold it by yourself!
L332358	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
L332351	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
L332350	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
L331954	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
L331953	u6165	m411	GRANT	Are you sure?
L331948	u6163	m411	ELLIE	And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
L331947	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - and swallows fresh ones.
L331946	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - barfs them up - -
L331945	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
L331944	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
L331943	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - a gizzard - -
L331942	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
L331941	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - like birds - -
L331938	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
L331937	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
L331936	u6165	m411	GRANT	Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
L331931	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yeah, I know.
L331930	u6165	m411	GRANT	Not just every six weeks.
L331929	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Constantly sick.
L331926	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I know.
L331925	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
L331894	u6163	m411	ELLIE	It's my favorite.
L331893	u6165	m411	GRANT	Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
L331831	u6165	m411	GRANT	Dilophosaurus.
L331830	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, shit.
L331691	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
L331690	u6165	m411	GRANT	Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
L331670	u6165	m411	GRANT	We're out of a job.
L331669	u6163	m411	ELLIE	So what are you thinking?
L331665	u6165	m411	GRANT	How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
L331664	u6163	m411	ELLIE	We were right!
L331663	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
L331659	u6165	m411	GRANT	Say again?
L331658	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
L331653	u6163	m411	ELLIE	They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
L331652	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
L331651	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The - - agility.  You're right!
L331650	u6165	m411	GRANT	The movement!
L331607	u6165	m411	GRANT	What kind of park is it?
L331606	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why would they care what we think?
L331600	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Small versions of adults, honey.
L331599	u6165	m411	GRANT	And what are those?
L331594	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Sattler.
L331593	u6165	m411	GRANT	Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
L331592	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, who's the jerk?
L331582	u6163	m411	ELLIE	It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
L331581	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
L331580	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anything else, you old fossil?
L331579	u6165	m411	GRANT	The Cretaceous.
L331578	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The what?
L331577	u6165	m411	GRANT	They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
L331576	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
L331575	u6165	m411	GRANT	They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
L331574	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
L331573	u6165	m411	GRANT	They smell.
L331572	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Cheap, cheap, cheap.
L331571	u6165	m411	GRANT	Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
L331570	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
L331569	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
L331568	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
L331560	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
L331559	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
L331543	u6165	m411	GRANT	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
L331542	u6163	m411	ELLIE	A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
L331541	u6163	m411	ELLIE	If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
L331540	u6165	m411	GRANT	The taphonomy sure looks that way.
L331539	u6163	m411	ELLIE	They died together?
L331538	u6165	m411	GRANT	Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
L332305	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Like hell it is!
L332304	u6170	m411	MULDOON	It's all right.
L332303	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
L332302	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why not?
L332301	u6170	m411	MULDOON	No. We can't.
L332300	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
L332299	u6170	m411	MULDOON	C'mon on, this way.
L332298	u6170	m411	MULDOON	The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
L332297	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.  Aw, God.
L332296	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Stick to my heels.
L332295	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm on channel two.
L332288	u6163	m411	ELLIE	We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
L332287	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Come on, let's go.
L332280	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay.
L332279	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I'm going with you.
L332277	u6170	m411	MULDOON	You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
L332276	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
L332228	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What's that?
L332227	u6170	m411	MULDOON	What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
L332136	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They're not here.
L332135	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?!
L332134	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I don't know.
L332133	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Do you see anything?
L332132	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan!
L332131	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Dr. Grant!
L332130	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The other car!
L332129	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Ellie, com one!!
L332128	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No, no, no!
L331758	u6170	m411	MULDOON	That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
L331757	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The fences are electrified, right?
L331756	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
L332248	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
L332247	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - shut up.
L332246	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes?
L332238	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
L332237	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
L332148	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
L332147	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
L332146	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
L332145	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster, faster!
L332124	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Please - - chance it.
L332123	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Can we chance moving him?
L331909	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yeah.
L331908	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dino droppings?
L331874	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331873	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
L331872	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331871	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
L331870	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Unpredictability....
L331869	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
L331868	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, imperfections?
L331867	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
L331866	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan, listen to this.
L331865	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
L331864	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
L331862	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
L331861	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'm still not clear on Chaos.
L331860	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
L331851	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
L331850	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
L331735	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anti-nature.
L331734	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It's anti-nature.
L331733	u6163	m411	ELLIE	When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
L331732	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And scary.
L331731	u6163	m411	ELLIE	And scary.
L331730	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I know, it's very exciting.
L331729	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I get ah - -
L331728	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That's right.  Will break through.
L331639	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
L331638	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No.
L331536	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
L331535	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Why not?
L331534	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
L331533	u6164	m411	GENNARO	If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
L331530	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
L331529	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
L331528	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
L331527	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
L331526	u6164	m411	GENNARO	You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
L331525	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He sends his apologies.
L331524	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What's this I hear at the airport? Hammond's not even here?
L331523	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hola, bienvenido
L331522	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hola, Juanito
L332023	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
L332022	u6173	m411	TIM	Yeah.
L332021	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Are they heavy?
L332020	u6173	m411	TIM	In a box under my seat.
L332019	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where did you find those things?
L332015	u6173	m411	TIM	People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
L332014	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
L332013	u6173	m411	TIM	Up and down, up and down!
L331829	u6173	m411	TIM	Dilophosaurus.
L331828	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What are we looking for?
L331827	u6173	m411	TIM	I can't see.
L331799	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
L331798	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where are the brakes?
L331797	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
L331785	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Thank you.
L331784	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
L331766	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
L331765	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
L331764	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
L331763	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
L331762	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
L331761	u6164	m411	GENNARO	And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
L331701	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
L331700	u6164	m411	GENNARO	John, we - - what I'm just saying....
L331689	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
L331688	u6164	m411	GENNARO	This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
L331645	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
L331644	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
L331643	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
L331642	u6164	m411	GENNARO	The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
L332330	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
L332329	u6173	m411	TIM	Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
L332325	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
L332324	u6173	m411	TIM	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
L332323	u6165	m411	GRANT	Go, go, go, jump!
L332320	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
L332319	u6173	m411	TIM	I can't!  I'm scared!
L332290	u6173	m411	TIM	Nope.
L332289	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
L332216	u6165	m411	GRANT	Amphibian DNA.
L332215	u6173	m411	TIM	But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
L332214	u6165	m411	GRANT	You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
L332201	u6165	m411	GRANT	This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
L332200	u6173	m411	TIM	It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
L332199	u6165	m411	GRANT	Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
L332198	u6173	m411	TIM	It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
L332197	u6165	m411	GRANT	Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
L332177	u6173	m411	TIM	A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
L332176	u6165	m411	GRANT	You got me.
L332175	u6173	m411	TIM	A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
L332174	u6165	m411	GRANT	I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
L332173	u6173	m411	TIM	What do you call a blind dinosaur?
L332170	u6165	m411	GRANT	Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
L332169	u6173	m411	TIM	Straight-A brainiac!
L332160	u6173	m411	TIM	Thunder lizard!
L332159	u6165	m411	GRANT	"It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means ""thunder lizard""."
L332107	u6165	m411	GRANT	Maybe -- it's hard to say.
L332106	u6173	m411	TIM	I doubt it.
L332105	u6165	m411	GRANT	You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
L332104	u6173	m411	TIM	That's a good idea.
L332103	u6165	m411	GRANT	'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
L332100	u6173	m411	TIM	What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
L332099	u6165	m411	GRANT	So am I going to help you with your foot?
L332098	u6173	m411	TIM	This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
L332097	u6165	m411	GRANT	Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
L332096	u6173	m411	TIM	No.
L332095	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
L332094	u6173	m411	TIM	Yes it is.
L332093	u6165	m411	GRANT	Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
L332092	u6165	m411	GRANT	That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
L332091	u6173	m411	TIM	I threw up.
L332057	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
L332056	u6173	m411	TIM	I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
L332055	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, are you okay?
L332054	u6165	m411	GRANT	Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
L331928	u6165	m411	GRANT	Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
L331927	u6173	m411	TIM	These look kind of familiar.
L331885	u6165	m411	GRANT	Really?
L331884	u6173	m411	TIM	And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
L331813	u6173	m411	TIM	Whichever one you are.
L331812	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
L331811	u6173	m411	TIM	Tim.
L331810	u6165	m411	GRANT	Listen, ahh - -
L331809	u6173	m411	TIM	Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
L331805	u6165	m411	GRANT	Oh, yeah - - great.
L331804	u6173	m411	TIM	I read your book.
L332048	u6165	m411	GRANT	There's gotta be something - -
L332047	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	What?  What can we do?
L332046	u6165	m411	GRANT	We gotta do something.
L332045	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Oh my God!
L332039	u6165	m411	GRANT	Relatively.
L332038	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	You're sure?!
L332037	u6165	m411	GRANT	Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
L332032	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	When you gotta go, you gotta go.
L332031	u6165	m411	GRANT	Where does he think he's going?
L332012	u6165	m411	GRANT	Fine.
L332011	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I know.
L332010	u6165	m411	GRANT	I didn't say you were scared.
L332009	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I didn't say I was scared.
L332008	u6165	m411	GRANT	What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
L332007	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Kids get scared.
L332006	u6165	m411	GRANT	Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
L332005	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	The kids okay?
L332004	u6165	m411	GRANT	Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
L331985	u6165	m411	GRANT	No.
L331984	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	You want to talk about this?
L331983	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, they hate me.
L331982	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Machines hate you?
L331981	u6165	m411	GRANT	I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
L331980	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
L331979	u6165	m411	GRANT	What'd I touch?!
L331978	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
L331977	u6165	m411	GRANT	Why?
L331976	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -

L331969	u6165	m411	GRANT	You're married?
L331968	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
L331967	u6165	m411	GRANT	You got any kids?

L331923	u6165	m411	GRANT	You have no idea.
L331922	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
L331674	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Not without massive sequence gaps!
L331673	u6165	m411	GRANT	Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
L331628	u6165	m411	GRANT	Try to!
L331627	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	So you two dig up dinosaurs?
L332373	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
L332372	u6165	m411	GRANT	Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
L331789	u6165	m411	GRANT	"What does he mean by ""target audience""?"
L331788	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
L331787	u6165	m411	GRANT	Who?
L331786	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Ah - - they're here.
L331755	u6165	m411	GRANT	Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
L331754	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
L331750	u6165	m411	GRANT	Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
L331749	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
L331717	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Wu?
L331716	u6165	m411	GRANT	Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
L331696	u6165	m411	GRANT	Let's get outta here!
L331695	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
L331694	u6165	m411	GRANT	Can't you stop these things?!
L331657	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
L331656	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
L331655	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
L331654	u6165	m411	GRANT	That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
L331612	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	For a further three years.
L331611	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
L331610	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
L331609	u6165	m411	GRANT	No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
L331608	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
L331605	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
L331604	u6165	m411	GRANT	What kind of opinions?
L331603	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
L331602	u6165	m411	GRANT	I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
L331601	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
L331589	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
L331588	u6165	m411	GRANT	And who in God's name do you think you are....?

L331586	u6165	m411	GRANT	Hey, we were saving that!

L332345	u6165	m411	GRANT	I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
L332337	u6165	m411	GRANT	I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!

L332218	u6165	m411	GRANT	Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!

L332255	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"Wait a minute?  What do you mean ""worked""?  Everything is still off!"
L332254	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
L332244	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have ""thinktelligence.""  You think narrowly and call it ""being focused.""  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions."
L332243	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
L331779	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
L331778	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
L331777	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
L331776	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
L331775	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
L331774	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
L331772	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
L331771	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
L331723	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
L331722	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Your silence intrigues me.
L331637	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
L331636	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Don't do that!
L331635	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, John.
L331634	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
L331633	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
L331632	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
L331631	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
L331630	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
L331629	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
L331844	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Thanks, Dad.
L331843	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
L331842	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
L331841	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
L331840	u6171	m411	NEDRY	You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
L331839	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
L331838	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
L332079	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Sure.
L332078	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
L332070	u6170	m411	MULDOON	There's no sign of him anywhere.
L332069	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well?
L331915	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Thanks, Steve.
L331914	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Tell them when they get back to the cars.
L331913	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Sustain winds 45 knots.
L331820	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Ray, start the tour program.
L331819	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
L331818	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Why didn't I build in Orlando?

L335252	u6198	m414	ENGLEHORN	I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
L335216	u6198	m414	ENGLEHORN	Two... maybe three.
L335215	u6197	m414	DENHAM	I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
L335214	u6198	m414	ENGLEHORN	There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
L335143	u6197	m414	DENHAM	We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
L335142	u6198	m414	ENGLEHORN	I tell you it doesn't exist!
L335141	u6197	m414	DENHAM	"What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  ""Skull Island""  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!"
L335140	u6198	m414	ENGLEHORN	Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
L335113	u6197	m414	DENHAM	A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
L335112	u6202	m414	MR GINTING	Man Eater!!!
L335106	u6197	m414	DENHAM	That's too bad.
L335105	u6202	m414	MR GINTING	We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
L335103	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
L335102	u6202	m414	MR GINTING	Native costume?
L335101	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
L335086	u6202	m414	MR GINTING	The mountains?
L335085	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
L335084	u6202	m414	MR GINTING	You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
L335074	u6197	m414	DENHAM	"And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation ""Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World"". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens."
L335073	u6202	m414	MR GINTING	We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
L335072	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
L335459	u6199	m414	JACK	Yeah.
L335458	u6197	m414	DENHAM	It must have been terrifying?
L335457	u6199	m414	JACK	Yeah.
L335456	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Did you fear for your life?
L335451	u6199	m414	JACK	Nab- Let's get it over with.
L335450	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Are you nervous Jack?
L335446	u6197	m414	DENHAM	"She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - ""Beauty and the Beast"".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there."
L335445	u6199	m414	JACK	Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
L335444	u6197	m414	DENHAM	How about Ann? Is she going with you?
L335443	u6199	m414	JACK	Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
L335403	u6197	m414	DENHAM	I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
L335402	u6199	m414	JACK	Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
L335392	u6197	m414	DENHAM	The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
L335391	u6199	m414	JACK	What?
L335390	u6197	m414	DENHAM	I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
L335378	u6199	m414	JACK	Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
L335377	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
L335357	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
L335356	u6199	m414	JACK	They were just tasting the berries.
L335355	u6199	m414	JACK	) They are now.
L335354	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
L335352	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Kong ...
L335351	u6199	m414	JACK	That's your monkey, Denham.
L335350	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
L335348	u6199	m414	JACK	You better not slow us down, Denham!
L335347	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
L335346	u6199	m414	JACK	Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
L335343	u6199	m414	JACK	An ape ... some kind of ape.
L335342	u6197	m414	DENHAM	What was it, Jack?
L335341	u6199	m414	JACK	Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
L335340	u6197	m414	DENHAM	Did you see her?
L335521	u6200	m414	KID	What's compassion, mister.
L335520	u6199	m414	JACK	Compassion.
L335519	u6200	m414	KID	What's that?
L335518	u6199	m414	JACK	Coz of something I lost.
L335517	u6200	m414	KID	Why?
L335516	u6199	m414	JACK	Yeah.
L335515	u6200	m414	KID	Are you gonna start it up?
L342603	u6277	m420	ALICE	Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
L342602	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
L342504	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Absolutely.
L342503	u6277	m420	ALICE	Can we rest soon?
L342502	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Are you alright?
L342492	u6277	m420	ALICE	I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
L342491	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes, miss.
L342490	u6277	m420	ALICE	We leave in the morning?!
L342489	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	My God, you've grown up.
L342949	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
L342948	u6278	m420	CORA	Where will we go?
L342944	u6278	m420	CORA	I have nothing to go back for.
L342943	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Will you go back to England?
L342939	u6278	m420	CORA	Alice?
L342938	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	And my compliments to you...
L342897	u6278	m420	CORA	...never doubt what you are doing.
L342896	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
L342892	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes. I want you to go.
L342891	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
L342884	u6278	m420	CORA	Our father? Did you see my father?
L342883	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Maybe...
L342882	u6278	m420	CORA	Are we safe?
L342782	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
L342781	u6278	m420	CORA	What is it?
L342778	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Do not.  Promise me.
L342777	u6278	m420	CORA	No. I will find you.
L342776	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
L342775	u6278	m420	CORA	What would you have me do?
L342774	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Because what I am interested in is right here...
L342773	u6278	m420	CORA	They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
L342683	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
L342682	u6278	m420	CORA	What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
L342680	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Miss.  May I?
L342679	u6278	m420	CORA	Mr Poe?
L342599	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
L342598	u6278	m420	CORA	Much further?
L342597	u6278	m420	CORA	On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
L342596	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Sorry to disappoint you...
L342595	u6278	m420	CORA	You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
L342593	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
L342592	u6278	m420	CORA	In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
L342591	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
L342590	u6278	m420	CORA	And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
L342589	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
L342588	u6278	m420	CORA	How did you learn English?
L342587	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I do not remember them. I was one or two.
L342586	u6278	m420	CORA	I'm sorry.
L342585	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
L342583	u6278	m420	CORA	Thank you so much.
L342582	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
L342581	u6278	m420	CORA	We're a breed apart and we make no sense...?
L342580	u6278	m420	CORA	Why did they turn back?
L342579	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	The Ottawa are gone.
L342578	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	"Yes. And ""do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."""
L342577	u6278	m420	CORA	What?!
L342576	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	"Yes. He said... ""do not try to make them understand you."""
L342575	u6278	m420	CORA	He did?
L342574	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
L342573	u6278	m420	CORA	"Your ""father""?"
L342572	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Well that is to be expected. My father...
L342571	u6278	m420	CORA	You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
L342570	u6278	m420	CORA	You knew them.
L342569	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
L342568	u6278	m420	CORA	Why didn't you bury those people?
L342566	u6278	m420	CORA	I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
L342565	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Let us go, miss.
L342564	u6278	m420	CORA	Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
L342771	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
L342770	u6285	m420	MUNRO	You do not know what you are saying!
L342769	u6278	m420	CORA	"Justice?  If that's ""justice""..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people."
L342768	u6285	m420	MUNRO	But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
L342760	u6278	m420	CORA	He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
L342759	u6285	m420	MUNRO	The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
L342628	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I sent three men to Webb!
L342627	u6278	m420	CORA	There was no letter.
L342626	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What?
L342625	u6278	m420	CORA	There was none!
L342624	u6285	m420	MUNRO	My letter...
L342623	u6278	m420	CORA	When? How?
L342622	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
L342937	u6278	m420	CORA	What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
L342936	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
L342890	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	What the bloody hell plan is this?
L342889	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes. Go ahead.
L342766	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
L342765	u6278	m420	CORA	"They do not live their lives ""by your leave.""  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way."
L342762	u6278	m420	CORA	You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
L342761	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
L342719	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
L342718	u6278	m420	CORA	beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
L342710	u6278	m420	CORA	I am sorry, Duncan...
L342709	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I see...
L342707	u6278	m420	CORA	Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
L342706	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
L342630	u6278	m420	CORA	He delivered no such message.
L342629	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	One called Magua arrived.
L342494	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	It can be dangerous...
L342493	u6278	m420	CORA	My God, Alice.
L342487	u6278	m420	CORA	Yes. Yes, I will.
L342486	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Will you consider that?
L342485	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
L342484	u6278	m420	CORA	Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
L342483	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Some?
L342482	u6278	m420	CORA	Some say that's the way of it.
L342481	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
L342480	u6278	m420	CORA	Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
L342478	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	"Aversion?  No... ""Hatred""... ""Loathing""..."
L342477	u6278	m420	CORA	You still have an aversion to the water?
L342476	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	And by sea!
L342475	u6278	m420	CORA	I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
L342881	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	: Only one or two loads.
L342880	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Any powder?
L342879	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
L342878	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	And if we're unlucky?
L342877	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
L342876	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Then what?
L342875	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
L342874	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I don't understand!
L342873	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	We don't.
L342872	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Where do we go from here?
L342869	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
L342868	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Head for... for the white water.
L342865	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
L342864	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	How long?
L342735	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
L342734	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
L342733	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	That is the truth!
L342732	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	That is sedition! Treason!
L342731	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
L342558	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Excuse me...
L342557	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Ottawa!
L342556	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Who were these people?
L342552	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Do not let gratitude get in the way...
L342551	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
L342548	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
L342547	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
L342546	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	"I ain't your ""scout"". And I am in no damn militia."
L342545	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
L342544	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
L342543	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fort Edward, then?
L342542	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	No.
L342541	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
L342540	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
L342539	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
L342538	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
L342537	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
L342536	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Dark haired...
L342535	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	What?!
L342534	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
L342533	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
L342532	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
L342531	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	How far is it, scout?
L342527	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	...Fort William Henry.
L342526	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	We were headed...
L342525	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
L342438	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
L342437	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
L342436	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
L342433	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
L342432	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	Will you men help us stop the French?
L342431	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
L342430	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
L342429	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
L342428	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	What did you say?
L342427	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Your enemy...
L342426	u6282	m420	LIEUTENANT	It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
L342749	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.
L342748	u6281	m420	JACK	That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
L342747	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Got a reason to stay.
L342746	u6281	m420	JACK	You're not coming with us?
L342745	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
L342742	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
L342741	u6281	m420	JACK	I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
L342409	u6281	m420	JACK	We'll see in the morning...
L342408	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
L342407	u6281	m420	JACK	A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
L342406	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
L342404	u6281	m420	JACK	Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
L342403	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
L342928	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
L342927	u6283	m420	MAGUA	The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
L342926	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
L342925	u6283	m420	MAGUA	No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
L342924	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
L342922	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
L342921	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
L342920	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
L342725	u6285	m420	MUNRO	You forget yourself!
L342724	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
L342723	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
L342717	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What did you see, Major?
L342716	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
L342657	u6285	m420	MUNRO	That's all, sir.
L342656	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Many men here, their homes are in the path.
L342654	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
L342653	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
L342647	u6285	m420	MUNRO	...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
L342646	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
L342637	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What else?
L342636	u6279	m420	HAWKEYE	Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
L342469	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	By your leave, sir.
L342468	u6288	m420	WEBB	The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
L342467	u6288	m420	WEBB	"Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The ""Scotsman"" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you."
L342466	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
L342465	u6288	m420	WEBB	You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
L342464	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
L342463	u6288	m420	WEBB	"I know.  One has to give Americans ""reasons"" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here."
L342462	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	"The Crown ""negotiating"" the terms of service?"
L342461	u6288	m420	WEBB	And what is that?
L342460	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
L342811	u6285	m420	MUNRO	The decision is final.
L342810	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sir!
L342809	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
L342808	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
L342807	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
L342796	u6285	m420	MUNRO	You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
L342795	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
L342764	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	"And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a ""by your leave."""
L342763	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
L342659	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
L342658	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Things were done. Nobody was spared...
L342651	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
L342650	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes, sir.
L342649	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Webb's at Edward?
L342648	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
L342645	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
L342644	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
L342643	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What a place for them...
L342635	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Thank you. How can I reward you?
L342634	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
L342633	u6285	m420	MUNRO	What happened to you?
L342632	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
L342631	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
L342846	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fire!
L342845	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Right - about face! March! First rank present!
L342843	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Yes sir!
L342842	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
L342701	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Atten-hut!
L342700	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
L342699	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!
L342698	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sergeant Major!
L342696	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fire!!!
L342695	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Shoulder arms!  Present! 
L342694	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
L342693	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Advance, Sergeant Major!
L342692	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Fire!!!
L342691	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
L342690	u6287	m420	SERGEANT MAJOR	Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
L342689	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Sergeant! Form three ranks!
L342913	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Heart. Give Magua new heart.
L342912	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	What is enough?
L342910	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	The King? The King has mountains of gold!
L342909	u6283	m420	MAGUA	How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
L342908	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes.
L342907	u6283	m420	MAGUA	For Munro children?
L342906	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Gold could be arranged.
L342905	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
L342904	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes.
L342903	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
L342902	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Yes.
L342901	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Wampum?
L342900	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Three, four oxen... much wampum.
L342899	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Gifts?
L342898	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
L342511	u6283	m420	MAGUA	"Magua say: ""Yes. Good idea."""
L342510	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	Excuse me. What did you say?
L342509	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness.
L342508	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
L342507	u6283	m420	MAGUA	I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
L342506	u6280	m420	HEYWARD	We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
L342730	u6281	m420	JACK	Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
L342729	u6285	m420	MUNRO	This interview's over! The militia stays!
L342728	u6281	m420	JACK	Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
L342727	u6285	m420	MUNRO	British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
L342726	u6281	m420	JACK	We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
L342715	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
L342714	u6281	m420	JACK	Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
L342713	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
L342836	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
L342835	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
L342834	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
L342833	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My son Magua's pain is my pain.
L342832	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
L342831	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
L342830	u6283	m420	MAGUA	And this?
L342829	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
L342827	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
L342826	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
L342825	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
L342824	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
L342823	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
L342822	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
L342821	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Yes.
L342820	u6283	m420	MAGUA	Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
L342671	u6283	m420	MAGUA	When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
L342670	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
L342813	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Granted, Monsieur.
L342812	u6285	m420	MUNRO	I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
L342806	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Allow me to consult with my officers.
L342805	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Carry them to England to your King with pride.
L342804	u6285	m420	MUNRO	My colors?
L342803	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Granted.
L342802	u6285	m420	MUNRO	The honors of war?
L342801	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
L342800	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Their arms?
L342799	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
L342798	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Such as...?
L342791	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
L342790	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
L342789	u6285	m420	MUNRO	However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
L342788	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
L342787	u6285	m420	MUNRO	Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
L342786	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
L342785	u6285	m420	MUNRO	And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
L342784	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
L342819	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
L342818	u6286	m420	SENTRY	C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
L342817	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	La victoire.
L342816	u6286	m420	SENTRY	Le mot d'ordre?
L342815	u6284	m420	MONTCALM	France.
L342814	u6286	m420	SENTRY	Qui vive?
L347669	u6289	m421	BECK	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
L347668	u6293	m421	DOC	Be careful with it.
L347660	u6293	m421	DOC	Intelligence may not be the right word...
L347659	u6289	m421	BECK	That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
L347591	u6289	m421	BECK	Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
L347590	u6293	m421	DOC	Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
L347589	u6289	m421	BECK	But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?

L347342	u6289	m421	BECK	Why can't we pick up his signal?
L347341	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Sixpack?
L347323	u6297	m421	WILLIE	You screw around like that again and--

L347402	u6291	m421	COBB	Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
L347401	u6289	m421	BECK	Something wrong, Cobb?
L347229	u6289	m421	BECK	You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
L347228	u6291	m421	COBB	What about our quota?
L347188	u6289	m421	BECK	He's not at his station.
L347187	u6291	m421	COBB	Where's Doc?!

L347514	u6289	m421	BECK	Do it.
L347513	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
L347512	u6289	m421	BECK	I'm not anxious to find out, either.

L347509	u6295	m421	MARTIN	Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.

L347261	u6294	m421	JONES	So that's all you do?...
L347254	u6291	m421	COBB	Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
L347253	u6294	m421	JONES	Listen to it for Christsake.
L347223	u6294	m421	JONES	Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
L347222	u6291	m421	COBB	No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
L347566	u6291	m421	COBB	I'm going to kill it!
L347565	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	It's Sixpack!
L347556	u6291	m421	COBB	I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
L347555	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
L347551	u6291	m421	COBB	I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
L347550	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
L347451	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	He's tanking on us...
L347450	u6291	m421	COBB	Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
L347292	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
L347291	u6291	m421	COBB	You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
L347290	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
L347289	u6291	m421	COBB	You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
L347276	u6291	m421	COBB	This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
L347275	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
L347274	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
L347273	u6291	m421	COBB	Who cares?
L347272	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
L347604	u6294	m421	JONES	Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
L347603	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Look.  Water.
L347602	u6294	m421	JONES	Under there?
L347601	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Getting some food.
L347580	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
L347579	u6294	m421	JONES	How'd you do that?
L347570	u6294	m421	JONES	'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
L347569	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
L347546	u6294	m421	JONES	Twelve hours!
L347545	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Typhoon?!
L347164	u6292	m421	DEJESUS	Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
L347163	u6294	m421	JONES	Burritos...Enchiladas...
L347662	u6293	m421	DOC	I don't know.  I'm guessing.
L347661	u6294	m421	JONES	Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
L347657	u6293	m421	DOC	...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
L347656	u6294	m421	JONES	No fuckin' lie...
L347655	u6293	m421	DOC	The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
L347652	u6294	m421	JONES	Like a leech.
L347651	u6293	m421	DOC	It would explain the suction- like appendages.
L347648	u6293	m421	DOC	It's had a meal.
L347647	u6294	m421	JONES	Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
L347622	u6294	m421	JONES	I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
L347621	u6293	m421	DOC	I'm going to try to remove it.
L347620	u6294	m421	JONES	What are you going to do to him?
L347619	u6293	m421	DOC	We've got to get him to the infirmary.
L347533	u6293	m421	DOC	We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
L347532	u6294	m421	JONES	Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
L347531	u6293	m421	DOC	The infirmary?...
L347530	u6294	m421	JONES	Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
L347335	u6293	m421	DOC	Two hundred meters.
L347334	u6294	m421	JONES	How far away is she?
L347810	u6297	m421	WILLIE	I'm not touching you!
L347809	u6294	m421	JONES	Answer them and quit kicking me!
L347808	u6297	m421	WILLIE	It saw us!
L347806	u6294	m421	JONES	Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
L347805	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
L347804	u6294	m421	JONES	Tip top, Willie...tip top.
L347803	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Are you okay, Jonesy?
L347801	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
L347800	u6294	m421	JONES	How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
L347799	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Are you sure you saw something?
L347742	u6294	m421	JONES	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
L347741	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Don't spend all day down there.
L347738	u6294	m421	JONES	She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
L347737	u6297	m421	WILLIE	The shack...
L347724	u6294	m421	JONES	The air's stopped.
L347723	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What is it?
L347698	u6294	m421	JONES	The good doctor signed our death warrant.
L347697	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What is it?
L347691	u6294	m421	JONES	Oh man, that's just great...
L347690	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
L347650	u6294	m421	JONES	Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
L347649	u6297	m421	WILLIE	It needs blood?
L347635	u6294	m421	JONES	DeJesus...It's got him.
L347634	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What's wrong?
L347633	u6294	m421	JONES	I ought to smack your face!
L347632	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What on earth's the matter with you?
L347526	u6294	m421	JONES	Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
L347525	u6297	m421	WILLIE	How is he?
L347524	u6294	m421	JONES	Sixpack...
L347523	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Who were you talking to?
L347453	u6294	m421	JONES	"Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about ""whys,"" they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month."
L347452	u6297	m421	WILLIE	No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
L347370	u6294	m421	JONES	Debbie Does Dallas...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
L347369	u6297	m421	WILLIE	What is it?
L347286	u6294	m421	JONES	Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
L347285	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
L347202	u6294	m421	JONES	Let's hope it holds.
L347201	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Clear for pickup.
L347326	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
L347325	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Hardly.
L347324	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	What's wrong, did you miss me?
L347296	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
L347295	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	Bitch!  Look what you did!
L347237	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Right.
L347236	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
L347235	u6297	m421	WILLIE	Your pocket?
L347234	u6296	m421	SIXPACK	My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
L367823	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
L367822	u6453	m429	ANNE	I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
L367821	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	There were two.  Not one.  But two.
L367763	u6453	m429	ANNE	We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
L367762	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
L367761	u6453	m429	ANNE	D'Artagnan.
L367760	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	My Queen...
L367512	u6453	m429	ANNE	Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
L367511	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
L367509	u6453	m429	ANNE	Nothing... Nothing.
L367508	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
L367507	u6453	m429	ANNE	If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
L367506	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
L367504	u6453	m429	ANNE	No, stay back!  Stay back!
L367503	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	What -- ?
L367502	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady...?
L367501	u6453	m429	ANNE	Oh God I -- Forgive me...
L367200	u6453	m429	ANNE	That is good.
L367199	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No, M'lady.
L367198	u6453	m429	ANNE	And you were not hurt?
L367197	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	God smiled upon us.
L367196	u6453	m429	ANNE	I understand you saved my son's life today.
L367195	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady...?
L367817	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
L367816	u6453	m429	ANNE	No, Louis!  No!
L367815	u6459	m429	LOUIS	D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
L367805	u6459	m429	LOUIS	He is nothing now.
L367804	u6453	m429	ANNE	He is your brother!
L367803	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What had you to do with this, Mother?
L367802	u6459	m429	LOUIS	My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
L367801	u6453	m429	ANNE	Louis, please -- !
L367704	u6453	m429	ANNE	Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
L367703	u6459	m429	LOUIS	It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
L367701	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
L367700	u6453	m429	ANNE	Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
L367699	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
L367698	u6453	m429	ANNE	He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
L367697	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
L367696	u6453	m429	ANNE	First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
L367695	u6459	m429	LOUIS	He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
L367694	u6453	m429	ANNE	I wish to discuss your brother.
L367693	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What is it, mother?
L367692	u6453	m429	ANNE	We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
L367691	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I am preparing for a ball!
L367690	u6453	m429	ANNE	May I speak with you?  Alone?
L367689	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Mother -- ?
L367782	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Shut up, knave!
L367781	u6459	m429	LOUIS	D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
L367736	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
L367735	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
L367734	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Wh-- Wha--
L367306	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
L367305	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
L367304	u6459	m429	LOUIS	How goes that favor I asked of you?
L367303	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Your Majesty...
L367138	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
L367137	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
L367136	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
L367135	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	How can I serve you in this?
L367134	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
L367133	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
L367132	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
L367131	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
L367848	u6455	m429	ATHOS	To the Bastille.  And death.
L367847	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Then to the Bastille.
L367843	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Perhaps he serves a different king.
L367842	u6455	m429	ATHOS	So what has changed?
L367841	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
L367840	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You're a fool!
L367839	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	He seeks redemption.
L367833	u6455	m429	ATHOS	We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
L367832	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Bloody hell...
L367712	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Hold your goblet with two fingers.
L367711	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
L367668	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
L367667	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But --
L367666	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
L367665	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Aramis, this will never --
L367620	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
L367619	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But --
L367618	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
L367617	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What you're asking is impossible!
L367616	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
L367615	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
L367614	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
L367613	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Where are you going?!
L367608	u6455	m429	ATHOS	All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
L367607	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
L367606	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Poor Phillippe!
L367597	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- but --
L367596	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
L367595	u6455	m429	ATHOS	We must stop him!
L367594	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
L367593	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Hang himself?!
L367592	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	About to hang himself, I should think.
L367591	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- what is he doing?
L367590	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Now.  You were saying?
L367589	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
L367588	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- what is Porthos doing?
L367587	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Go on.
L367586	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
L367585	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You grow fond of him.  That's good.
L367584	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
L367580	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
L367579	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Three days??!!
L367578	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Three days.
L367577	u6455	m429	ATHOS	In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
L367576	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You can do it.
L367575	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
L367574	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	More wine!!
L367573	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
L367572	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	How is he?
L367555	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Yes, and he has a choice!
L367554	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
L367553	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
L367552	u6455	m429	ATHOS	And people close to him, who --
L367551	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Those can be adopted --
L367550	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
L367549	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I have it all worked out.
L367548	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
L367497	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
L367496	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
L367495	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
L367494	u6455	m429	ATHOS	He who is not with us is against us.
L367493	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
L367492	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
L367491	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
L367490	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
L367489	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Tomorrow.
L367488	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Who is he, Aramis?
L367465	u6455	m429	ATHOS	His plight is obvious, isn't it?
L367464	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
L367463	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
L367427	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
L367426	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	A body.
L367425	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What is that?
L367424	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Come, we have a boat waiting.
L367423	u6455	m429	ATHOS	The Prison of Belle Sur.
L367422	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Soon enough.  Here we are.
L367421	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
L367419	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Making the key to the throne.
L367418	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What are they doing?
L367403	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I am with you!
L367402	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	It can.  I know the way.
L367399	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Replace the king.
L367398	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What do you propose to do?
L367393	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
L367392	u6455	m429	ATHOS	And some problems cannot be settled without one.
L367884	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
L367883	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
L367867	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	That doesn't matter now.
L367866	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
L367865	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
L367788	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
L367787	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Everyone back.
L367786	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Pull them back!
L367785	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	You can't do it.
L367784	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
L367416	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I know.  God go with you.
L367415	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
L367414	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
L367413	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
L367406	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
L367405	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
L367404	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No!  Stop --
L367391	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
L367390	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
L367107	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
L367106	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
L367105	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	A simple theological discussion.
L367879	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	He is right, d'Artagnan.
L367878	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
L367835	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
L367834	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
L367717	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
L367716	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
L367673	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The Queen Mother.  Anne.
L367672	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Who?
L367671	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
L367655	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
L367654	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	He's going to kill you, Aramis.
L367647	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Did she have tits like that?
L367646	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
L367645	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Aramis... These are... these are whores!
L367642	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Come on...
L367641	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
L367634	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Why didn't you say so?
L367633	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	We go someplace dangerous.
L367632	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	What use am I?
L367631	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Coming?
L367604	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Well... Well... Okay.
L367603	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
L367542	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
L367541	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	But why?
L367540	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
L367539	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
L367538	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	No, not Louis!
L367537	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
L367536	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
L367535	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
L367530	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	But I was on duty...
L367529	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
L367528	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
L367526	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
L367525	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
L367467	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
L367466	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	And why are you so glum?
L367397	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
L367396	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
L367395	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
L367394	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
L367386	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Catacombs.  Very holy.
L367385	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
L367384	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	It is also a place of burial.
L367383	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Mother of God!
L367382	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
L367381	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Where are we?
L367380	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
L367379	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Aramis... is this the way to hell?
L367102	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
L367101	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
L367098	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Forgiveness?
L367097	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Forgiveness.
L367096	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
L367095	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	There are more important things than tits.
L367094	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
L367093	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
L367092	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
L367852	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
L367851	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	It worked!
L367846	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
L367845	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You are right.  But it is a trap.
L367844	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
L367838	u6455	m429	ATHOS	He lures us to capture.
L367837	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan.
L367670	u6455	m429	ATHOS	At a ball, everyone watches the King!
L367669	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	D'Artagnan, unready?
L367432	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
L367431	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What do we do now?
L367430	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
L367429	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Who does?
L367428	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
L367232	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Raoul --
L367231	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
L367230	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
L367229	u6465	m429	RAOUL	It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
L367228	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
L367227	u6465	m429	RAOUL	I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
L367226	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Die?  What...?
L367225	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
L367224	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
L367223	u6465	m429	RAOUL	She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
L367222	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Michelle cannot possibly accept!
L367221	u6465	m429	RAOUL	We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
L367220	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- are you sure?
L367219	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
L367218	u6455	m429	ATHOS	That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
L367117	u6455	m429	ATHOS	She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
L367116	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
L367115	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Perhaps this will help.
L367114	u6465	m429	RAOUL	I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
L367113	u6455	m429	ATHOS	None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
L367112	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Do I look all right?
L367861	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
L367860	u6455	m429	ATHOS	He lies.  He is here to trap us.
L367779	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
L367778	u6455	m429	ATHOS	If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
L367410	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
L367409	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
L367408	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
L367407	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
L367353	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
L367352	u6455	m429	ATHOS	The King killed my son!
L367351	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
L367350	u6455	m429	ATHOS	To kill the king.
L367349	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Where are you going?
L367348	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, I beg you --
L367347	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Get out of my way.
L367346	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, please...!
L367246	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Save my son, d'Artagnan.
L367245	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
L367244	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You trust his character more than anyone else does.
L367243	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
L367242	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Oh my friend.
L367241	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I know.
L367240	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Raoul is everything to me.
L367239	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
L367238	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
L367237	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
L367236	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
L367235	u6455	m429	ATHOS	She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
L367234	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
L367233	u6455	m429	ATHOS	This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
L367216	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
L367215	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I heard your playing.
L367214	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
L367213	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
L367212	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
L367211	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
L367210	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
L367209	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Thanks, but not for me.
L367208	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
L367207	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It's been too long.
L367206	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, my friend!
L367205	u6455	m429	ATHOS	D'Artagnan!
L367898	u6455	m429	ATHOS	D'Artagnan...
L367897	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
L367886	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
L367885	u6455	m429	ATHOS	One for all.  All for one.
L367856	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	How did you --
L367855	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe...?
L367731	u6455	m429	ATHOS	She will be at the ball.
L367730	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	The room of the King's favorite mistress?
L367663	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Your mother's.
L367662	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Whose rooms are those?
L367661	u6455	m429	ATHOS	These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
L367627	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Porthos told me.
L367626	u6455	m429	ATHOS	How did you know -- ?
L367625	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
L367624	u6455	m429	ATHOS	No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
L367623	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
L367611	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
L367610	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
L367569	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
L367568	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	What is that?
L367567	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It is something I have done -- or did not do.
L367566	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
L367565	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
L367564	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	What is its antidote?
L367563	u6455	m429	ATHOS	The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
L367562	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
L367561	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
L367560	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
L367559	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Recent hours have been a shock.
L367478	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe.  Rest now.
L367477	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
L367474	u6455	m429	ATHOS	And you never knew why?
L367473	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	"A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, ""What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?""  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting."
L367472	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Who came?
L367471	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
L367469	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	Just... water.
L367468	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Are you hungry?
L367820	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	There.
L367819	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Where is Michelle?
L367811	u6459	m429	LOUIS	They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
L367810	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
L367809	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Forgive?!
L367808	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
L367807	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Get out of my way.
L367806	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
L367799	u6459	m429	LOUIS	My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
L367798	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
L367797	u6459	m429	LOUIS	He is my brother.
L367796	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	... You knew you had a double?
L367795	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I was told this impostor was dead!
L367794	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Yes, your Majesty.
L367793	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
L367792	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It shall be done, your Majesty.
L367791	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
L367726	u6459	m429	LOUIS	... tired.  Must... lie down.
L367725	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty...?
L367681	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
L367680	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
L367523	u6459	m429	LOUIS	It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
L367522	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
L367297	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Thank you, your Majesty.
L367296	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I will consider it.  Now leave me.
L367295	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
L367294	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Silence!  I order you!
L367293	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	At least help Raoul.
L367292	u6459	m429	LOUIS	That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
L367291	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
L367290	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
L367289	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
L367288	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
L367287	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
L367286	u6459	m429	LOUIS	That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
L367285	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty has had many women --
L367284	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
L367283	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
L367282	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Betrothed?  I think not.
L367281	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
L367280	u6459	m429	LOUIS	A personal nature?
L367279	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
L367278	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
L367277	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
L367276	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
L367156	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
L367155	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
L367154	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
L367153	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
L367152	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I decided it this morning.
L367151	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
L367150	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
L367149	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty...
L367893	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	I am unhurt --
L367892	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Phillippe!
L367881	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
L367880	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
L367771	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I must insist, Sire.
L367770	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	... The ball... Continue.
L367769	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
L367768	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Continue.
L367187	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What was the end page?
L367186	u6457	m429	KEEPER	You've... memorized...?
L367185	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	"Two-thirty-seven:  ""... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."""
L367184	u6457	m429	KEEPER	... Two-thirty-seven.
L367183	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What number, on the first page?
L367182	u6457	m429	KEEPER	Eh?
L367181	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What number did you tear out?
L367177	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	Thank you, Keeper.
L367176	u6457	m429	KEEPER	Food, moron.
L367085	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	No, Keeper.
L367084	u6457	m429	KEEPER	You dead yet?
L367888	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Shoot them!  Shoot them!
L367887	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Magnificent valor...
L367875	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
L367874	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
L367831	u6459	m429	LOUIS	When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
L367830	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Out directing the search for the traitors.
L367829	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
L367373	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
L367372	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
L367371	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You may go, Lieutenant.
L367370	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
L367369	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
L367368	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
L367367	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Did they kill him?
L367366	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
L367365	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Yes, yes, go on.
L367364	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
L367142	u6463	m429	PIERRE	What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
L367141	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Exactly why it should be given away.
L367140	u6463	m429	PIERRE	That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
L367139	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
L367130	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
L367129	u6463	m429	PIERRE	Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
L367128	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
L367127	u6463	m429	PIERRE	Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
L367126	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
L367517	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
L367516	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
L367515	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
L367378	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Oh Louis, Louis...
L367377	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
L367376	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
L367375	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Did you know... about Raoul?
L367363	u6459	m429	LOUIS	No, you may wait behind the screen.
L367362	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Shall I leave?
L367328	u6459	m429	LOUIS	If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
L367327	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Sire, I --
L367326	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You are beautiful.  You know you are.
L367324	u6459	m429	LOUIS	My dear, I've already done it.
L367323	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	You would do that, your Majesty?
L367322	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
L367321	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	I... we are humble people...
L367320	u6459	m429	LOUIS	This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
L367319	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	It's lovely.  It's just...
L367318	u6459	m429	LOUIS	The food doesn't please you?
L367317	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Enough of this, our dinner waits.
L367316	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Raoul... is in love...
L367315	u6459	m429	LOUIS	From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
L367314	u6459	m429	LOUIS	A letter.  May I see?
L367313	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	... Nothing.
L367312	u6459	m429	LOUIS	How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
L367311	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Sire!  I -- How did you --
L367169	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
L367168	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Sire, I --
L367167	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
L368286	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
L368285	u6466	m430	CRAIG	You mind if I ride with you?
L368279	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
L368278	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
L368266	u6468	m430	DOYLE	If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
L368265	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Every step of the way.
L368264	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Cooperate?
L368263	u6466	m430	CRAIG	I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
L368262	u6466	m430	CRAIG	That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
L368261	u6468	m430	DOYLE	If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
L368260	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
L368259	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
L368258	u6466	m430	CRAIG	I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
L368257	u6468	m430	DOYLE	We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
L368256	u6466	m430	CRAIG	We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
L368254	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
L368253	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
L368252	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What can I do for you?
L368250	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?
L368249	u6466	m430	CRAIG	Captain Doyle?
L368294	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Alright, stay on the phone.
L368293	u6467	m430	D.T.	What do you think?
L368292	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	You set to go -
L368291	u6467	m430	D.T.	We're by Ozone...
L368290	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Where are you?
L368289	u6467	m430	D.T.	Yeah?
L368138	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
L368137	u6467	m430	D.T.	You mean shut your ass down!
L368136	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	So what is they have enough to shut us down!
L368135	u6467	m430	D.T.	So what?
L368134	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
L368133	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
L368132	u6467	m430	D.T.	What do you need?
L368131	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	It's Marvosa -
L368439	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
L368438	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	It's just...catching up with me, you know?
L368437	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Something wrong with you Marvosa?
L368434	u6468	m430	DOYLE	That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
L368433	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
L368429	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
L368428	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
L368426	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Where do you come from, Marvosa?
L368425	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Gotta come from somewhere...
L368424	u6468	m430	DOYLE	It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
L368423	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What?
L368422	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Well don't you think that's odd?
L368421	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
L368420	u6468	m430	DOYLE	So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
L368419	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Yeah...
L368418	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Did you start out area six?
L368417	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
L368416	u6468	m430	DOYLE	When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
L368415	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What?
L368403	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
L368402	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What's this?
L368284	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Fine -
L368283	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	I'll take the south end -
L368282	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
L368281	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
L368280	u6468	m430	DOYLE	If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
L368270	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Right behind you.
L368269	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Let's roll -
L368244	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Fine...
L368243	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Find out for me.
L368241	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
L368240	u6468	m430	DOYLE	But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
L368239	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
L368238	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
L368237	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	What did the six-toes have to say?
L368202	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I didn't hit shit!
L368201	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Did you hit him?
L368125	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Don't worry -
L368124	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
L368122	u6468	m430	DOYLE	We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
L368121	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
L368120	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Great. Well that changes a lot...
L368119	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
L368118	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What the hell is this Marvosa!!
L368099	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
L368098	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
L368097	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
L368096	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
L368095	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
L368094	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What the hell happened?
L368060	u6468	m430	DOYLE	we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
L368059	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	You can cut the shit, asshole--
L368053	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Did you report it stolen?
L368052	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Bullshit...
L368572	u6469	m430	JIM	It wasn't in the cards.
L368571	u6468	m430	DOYLE	I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
L368570	u6469	m430	JIM	I'll live...
L368569	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Are you alright?
L368056	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
L368055	u6469	m430	JIM	I didn't break in - the back door was open!
L368054	u6468	m430	DOYLE	So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
L368051	u6469	m430	JIM	She stole my car!!
L368041	u6469	m430	JIM	I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
L368040	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
L368039	u6469	m430	JIM	And who are you?
L368038	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Alright, where is she?
L368223	u6470	m430	LURCH	Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
L368222	u6468	m430	DOYLE	And what did he do to the girl?
L368221	u6470	m430	LURCH	I was just having a little fun -
L368219	u6470	m430	LURCH	Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
L368218	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
L368217	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
L368216	u6470	m430	LURCH	Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
L368215	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Did he harm the girl?
L368214	u6470	m430	LURCH	Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
L368213	u6468	m430	DOYLE	And he took a swing at you?
L368212	u6470	m430	LURCH	The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
L368388	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
L368387	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	He said he was following up some lead.
L368386	u6468	m430	DOYLE	And where the hell is Marvosa?
L368380	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Could explain why Fleming was there.
L368379	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
L368378	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
L368377	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Something I don't already know?
L368376	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Well read this -
L368375	u6468	m430	DOYLE	No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
L368374	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Did you read today's paper?
L368115	u6468	m430	DOYLE	That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
L368114	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
L368113	u6468	m430	DOYLE	What?  Wait a minute -
L368112	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
L368111	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?
L368110	u6476	m430	ZYDOWSKI	You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
L368109	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Zydowski.  It's about time.
L368432	u6472	m430	OFFICER	LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
L368431	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Yeah?
L368430	u6472	m430	OFFICER	Captain?
L368384	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
L368383	u6472	m430	OFFICER	They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
L368382	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Speak of the devil.
L368314	u6472	m430	OFFICER	I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
L368313	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Where is he?!!
L368247	u6472	m430	OFFICER	I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
L368246	u6468	m430	DOYLE	Who is it?
L368245	u6472	m430	OFFICER	Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
L368579	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
L368578	u6469	m430	JIM	No -
L368577	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
L368576	u6469	m430	JIM	Where the hell is my car?
L368575	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Yeah.
L368574	u6469	m430	JIM	There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
L368526	u6469	m430	JIM	So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
L368525	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
L368524	u6469	m430	JIM	What happened with the tape?
L368523	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
L368522	u6469	m430	JIM	What did you do then?
L368521	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I had it all on tape...
L368518	u6469	m430	JIM	Found what?
L368516	u6469	m430	JIM	And what did you do?
L368504	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Yeah...they did.  One girl...
L368503	u6469	m430	JIM	Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
L368502	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
L368501	u6469	m430	JIM	No, but I'm listening.
L368500	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
L368499	u6469	m430	JIM	What exactly did you see?
L368498	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	No.  A witness.
L368497	u6469	m430	JIM	Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
L368496	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
L368495	u6469	m430	JIM	Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
L368494	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
L368493	u6469	m430	JIM	Why did you set me up?
L368456	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You'll find out - soon enough.
L368455	u6469	m430	JIM	What's going on here?
L367994	u6469	m430	JIM	Only on dates?
L367993	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	No.
L367992	u6469	m430	JIM	You always carry a gun with you?
L367991	u6469	m430	JIM	Figure you would have tried it already.
L367990	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
L367989	u6469	m430	JIM	No...
L367988	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Mind if I turn out the light?
L367985	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You're the mysterious type, right?
L367984	u6469	m430	JIM	No...
L367983	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	You got any family?
L367982	u6469	m430	JIM	Seattle.
L367981	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	Where up north?
L367980	u6469	m430	JIM	Up north.
L367979	u6473	m430	STEPHANIE	So where are you from?
L368467	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
L368466	u6469	m430	JIM	Are you going to be alright?
L368464	u6469	m430	JIM	I'm going to need a way to get there.
L368463	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
L368462	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
L368461	u6469	m430	JIM	Tubbs, these people mean business.
L368460	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I'm not going anywhere!
L368459	u6469	m430	JIM	That was her - the girl... We have to go.
L368448	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
L368447	u6469	m430	JIM	It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
L368446	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
L368444	u6474	m430	TUBBS	And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
L368443	u6469	m430	JIM	Both at the same bank...
L368442	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
L368441	u6469	m430	JIM	A bank?
L368440	u6474	m430	TUBBS	OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
L368372	u6469	m430	JIM	What else is new?
L368371	u6474	m430	TUBBS	You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
L368370	u6469	m430	JIM	I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
L368369	u6474	m430	TUBBS	So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
L368368	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
L368367	u6469	m430	JIM	How about Marvosa and the others?
L368366	u6469	m430	JIM	OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
L368365	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
L368364	u6469	m430	JIM	I knew I could count on you.
L368363	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
L368362	u6469	m430	JIM	No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
L368361	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Donut?
L368360	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Let's see what we got...
L368359	u6469	m430	JIM	1490...Breckinridge...
L368358	u6474	m430	TUBBS	OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
L368356	u6474	m430	TUBBS	OK...where do you want to start?
L368355	u6469	m430	JIM	I've got a better idea...
L368354	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
L368353	u6469	m430	JIM	I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
L368352	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
L368351	u6469	m430	JIM	I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
L368350	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Oh man...what happened?
L368349	u6469	m430	JIM	I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
L368348	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
L368347	u6469	m430	JIM	They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
L368346	u6474	m430	TUBBS	You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
L368345	u6469	m430	JIM	It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
L368344	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
L368343	u6469	m430	JIM	Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
L368342	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
L368341	u6469	m430	JIM	I killed them.
L368340	u6474	m430	TUBBS	And?...
L368338	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
L368337	u6469	m430	JIM	No...
L368332	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
L368331	u6469	m430	JIM	Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
L368330	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Holy shit -
L368273	u6474	m430	TUBBS	This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
L368272	u6469	m430	JIM	Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
L368180	u6469	m430	JIM	Please...
L368179	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Jesus, man...
L368178	u6469	m430	JIM	It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
L368177	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
L368176	u6469	m430	JIM	Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
L368175	u6474	m430	TUBBS	You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
L368173	u6469	m430	JIM	Yeah...
L368172	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
L368171	u6469	m430	JIM	No...I'm in some trouble...
L368170	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
L368169	u6469	m430	JIM	Tubbs, it's me.
L368166	u6469	m430	JIM	Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
L368165	u6474	m430	TUBBS	What?
L367971	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Not with this...
L367970	u6469	m430	JIM	You don't seem afraid of much.
L367969	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Screw him!
L367968	u6469	m430	JIM	What would your - boyfriend - think?
L367966	u6469	m430	JIM	Bartender said there are motels south of here.
L367965	u6475	m430	WOMAN	We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
L367964	u6469	m430	JIM	Ditched you?
L367963	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
L367962	u6469	m430	JIM	Are you a regular there?
L367961	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
L367960	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
L367957	u6469	m430	JIM	Hop in.
L367956	u6475	m430	WOMAN	I'm stranded out here.
L367955	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Mind if I come along for the ride?
L367954	u6469	m430	JIM	I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
L367953	u6475	m430	WOMAN	You must be going somewhere.
L367952	u6469	m430	JIM	Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
L367951	u6475	m430	WOMAN	Where are you going?
L368063	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	County jail - get in.
L368062	u6469	m430	JIM	Where am I going?
L368048	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Then what did you do, play canasta?
L368047	u6469	m430	JIM	No.  It wasn't like that!
L368046	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
L368045	u6469	m430	JIM	What?
L368044	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Did you have sex with her?
L368043	u6469	m430	JIM	No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
L368486	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Nahhh...
L368485	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
L368484	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
L368483	u6474	m430	TUBBS	I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
L368482	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Long gone, huh?
L368472	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
L368471	u6471	m430	MARVOSA	Where is he?
L368470	u6474	m430	TUBBS	Don't you guys ever knock?
L373507	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Know what?
L373506	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	You don't know.
L373444	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
L373443	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	They are dead.  In either case --
L372816	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	It's already begun.
L372815	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	We'll need a search running.
L372814	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	Their next target.  The name is Neo.
L372813	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
L372812	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	He'll be contacting us again.
L372811	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
L372810	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	Then the informant is real.
L373358	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You all look the same to me.
L373357	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
L373356	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	And you are?
L373355	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
L373350	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	They won't make it.
L373349	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Hurry!
L373348	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The sewers.  Of course.
L372797	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
L372796	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
L372794	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The orders were for your protection.
L372793	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
L372792	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
L372791	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	Oh shit.
L372790	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant?
L373397	u6525	m433	SWITCH	Oh, God.
L373396	u6518	m433	APOC	What?!
L373310	u6518	m433	APOC	Should Tank I.D. it?
L373309	u6525	m433	SWITCH	That's the third white van I've seen.
L373308	u6518	m433	APOC	What?
L373307	u6525	m433	SWITCH	Weird.
L373109	u6518	m433	APOC	No way.  Not possible.
L373108	u6525	m433	SWITCH	He's gonna make it.
L372833	u6519	m433	CHOI	All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
L372832	u6523	m433	NEO	You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
L372831	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't know... My computer...
L372830	u6519	m433	CHOI	Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
L372829	u6523	m433	NEO	Right...
L372828	u6519	m433	CHOI	I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
L372827	u6523	m433	NEO	If you get caught using that --
L372826	u6519	m433	CHOI	Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
L372824	u6519	m433	CHOI	Two grand.
L372823	u6523	m433	NEO	You got the money?
L372822	u6519	m433	CHOI	I know.  It's her fault.
L372821	u6523	m433	NEO	You're two hours late.
L372820	u6519	m433	CHOI	It's Choi.
L372819	u6523	m433	NEO	Who is it?
L373413	u6520	m433	CYPHER	No!
L373412	u6527	m433	TRINITY	... yes.
L373408	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
L373407	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamn you, Cypher!
L373405	u6520	m433	CYPHER	That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
L373404	u6527	m433	TRINITY	But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
L373402	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
L373401	u6527	m433	TRINITY	The Matrix isn't real!
L373400	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
L373399	u6527	m433	TRINITY	My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
L373398	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
L373395	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You killed them.
L373394	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
L373392	u6527	m433	TRINITY	An accident?!
L373391	u6520	m433	CYPHER	He had an accident.
L373390	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Cypher?  Where's Tank?
L373389	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Hello, Trinity.
L373128	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
L373127	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
L373126	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Don't tell me you're a believer now?
L373125	u6520	m433	CYPHER	There's something about him, isn't there?
L372786	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
L372785	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you sure this line is clean?
L372784	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Hear what?
L372783	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Did you hear that?
L372782	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
L372781	u6527	m433	TRINITY	If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
L372780	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You don't, do you?
L372779	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
L372778	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Do you?
L372777	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus believes he is the One.
L372776	u6520	m433	CYPHER	We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
L372775	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Don't be ridiculous.
L372773	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I know but I felt like taking a shift.
L372772	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You weren't supposed to relieve me.
L373187	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Any time.
L373186	u6523	m433	NEO	Thanks... for the drink.
L373184	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
L373183	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373182	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Dead.  All dead.
L373181	u6523	m433	NEO	What happened to them?
L373180	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Five.  Since I've been here.
L373179	u6523	m433	NEO	How many were there?
L373178	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
L373177	u6523	m433	NEO	Really?
L373176	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
L373175	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
L373174	u6523	m433	NEO	... Yeah.
L373173	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Why you're here?
L373168	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
L373167	u6523	m433	NEO	Do you always look at it encoded?
L373166	u6520	m433	CYPHER	The Matrix?  Yeah.
L373165	u6523	m433	NEO	Is that...?
L373164	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Midnight watch.
L373163	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373162	u6520	m433	CYPHER	No, it's all right.
L373161	u6523	m433	NEO	Sorry.
L373160	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
L373057	u6520	m433	CYPHER	He's going to pop!
L373056	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
L373370	u6526	m433	TANK	Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
L373369	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Just get me outta here.
L373368	u6526	m433	TANK	I got you.
L373367	u6520	m433	CYPHER	There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
L373366	u6526	m433	TANK	Cypher?
L373365	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I need an exit!  Fast!
L373364	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373589	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
L373588	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You can't use that until Neo is out!
L373585	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Five minutes.  Maybe six.
L373584	u6527	m433	TRINITY	How long?
L373569	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	He's beginning to believe.
L373568	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What is he doing?
L373333	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We have no choice.
L373332	u6527	m433	TRINITY	They'll be able to track it.
L373331	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Give me your phone.
L373007	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
L373006	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
L373000	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Shit!  Apoc?
L372999	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I got a fibrillation!
L372807	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go.
L372806	u6527	m433	TRINITY	All right --
L372805	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
L372804	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamnit!
L372803	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L372802	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are they any agent?
L372801	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
L373544	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
L373543	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
L373347	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
L373346	u6523	m433	NEO	No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
L373250	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
L373249	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, I don't know --
L373248	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
L373245	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
L373244	u6523	m433	NEO	Did you believe in them too?
L373243	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
L373242	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes I do.
L373241	u6523	m433	NEO	And you still believe I'm the One?
L373240	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
L373239	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
L373238	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That's why we're here.
L373237	u6523	m433	NEO	What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
L373236	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	What do you believe in?
L373235	u6523	m433	NEO	I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
L373234	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Why?
L373233	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
L373231	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That I would find the One.
L373230	u6523	m433	NEO	What did she tell you?
L373229	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L373228	u6523	m433	NEO	She helped you?
L373227	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
L373226	u6523	m433	NEO	And she's never wrong.
L373225	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
L373224	u6523	m433	NEO	How does she know?
L373223	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She would say she knows enough.
L373222	u6523	m433	NEO	And she knows what?  Everything?
L373221	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Of the Resistance.
L373220	u6523	m433	NEO	The beginning?
L373219	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
L373218	u6523	m433	NEO	So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
L373149	u6523	m433	NEO	What's going on?
L373148	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Set down in there.
L373144	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
L373143	u6523	m433	NEO	What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
L373142	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
L373141	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373140	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
L373137	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Look again.
L373136	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah.
L373135	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
L373134	u6523	m433	NEO	I think I do.
L373133	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you understand, Neo?
L373130	u6523	m433	NEO	What -- what lesson?
L373129	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
L373122	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The body cannot live without the mind.
L373121	u6523	m433	NEO	If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
L373120	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your mind makes it real.
L373119	u6523	m433	NEO	I thought it wasn't real.
L373115	u6523	m433	NEO	Because... I didn't think I would?
L373114	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you know why you didn't make it?
L373104	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
L373103	u6523	m433	NEO	I know what you're trying to do --
L373096	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
L373095	u6523	m433	NEO	You -- you're too fast.
L373094	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	How did I beat you?
L373089	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Show me.
L373088	u6523	m433	NEO	This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
L373066	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your training.
L373065	u6523	m433	NEO	For what?
L373064	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
L373051	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
L373050	u6523	m433	NEO	No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
L373042	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
L373041	u6523	m433	NEO	A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
L373040	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
L373035	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
L373034	u6523	m433	NEO	This isn't real?
L373033	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Wild, isn't it?
L373032	u6523	m433	NEO	Right now, we're inside a computer program?
L373020	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
L373019	u6523	m433	NEO	When?
L373018	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	More important than what is when?
L373017	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
L373015	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You've never used them before.
L373014	u6523	m433	NEO	Why do my eyes hurt?
L373013	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
L373012	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373009	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Far from it.
L373008	u6523	m433	NEO	... am I dead?
L372990	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Be what?  Be real?
L372989	u6523	m433	NEO	This can't be...
L372988	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
L372985	u6523	m433	NEO	What does that mean?
L372984	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
L372974	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
L372973	u6523	m433	NEO	What truth?
L372972	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
L372971	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you want to know what it is?
L372970	u6523	m433	NEO	The Matrix?
L372969	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
L372968	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know exactly what you mean.
L372967	u6523	m433	NEO	Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
L372966	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Why not?
L372965	u6523	m433	NEO	No.
L372964	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
L372963	u6523	m433	NEO	You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
L372962	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
L372961	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
L372960	u6523	m433	NEO	You could say that.
L372959	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
L372957	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Please.  Come.  Sit.
L372956	u6523	m433	NEO	It's an honor.
L372955	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
L372929	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go the the Adams Street bridge.
L372928	u6523	m433	NEO	... Yes.
L372927	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you still want to meet?
L372926	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
L372925	u6523	m433	NEO	What do you know?
L372924	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
L372923	u6523	m433	NEO	The agents --
L372922	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	This line is tapped so I must be brief.
L372902	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
L372901	u6523	m433	NEO	No way, no way, this is crazy.
L372900	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
L372899	u6523	m433	NEO	No!  It's too far away.
L372896	u6523	m433	NEO	How do you know all this?
L372895	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
L372890	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go!  Now!
L372889	u6523	m433	NEO	But what if...?
L372888	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The cubicle across from you is empty.
L372887	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
L372886	u6523	m433	NEO	How?!
L372885	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
L372884	u6523	m433	NEO	What the fuck do they want with me?!
L372883	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L372882	u6523	m433	NEO	Holy fucking shit!
L372880	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  Now.
L372879	u6523	m433	NEO	Right now?
L372878	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Stand up and see for yourself.
L372877	u6523	m433	NEO	Who's coming for me?
L372876	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
L372875	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus...
L372874	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
L372873	u6523	m433	NEO	Hello?
L373630	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	He is the One.  He is the One!
L373629	u6526	m433	TANK	How...?!
L373615	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do it!
L373614	u6526	m433	TANK	I'm going to make the call.
L373587	u6526	m433	TANK	Yes, sir.
L373586	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Tank, charge the E.M.P.
L373549	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We're on our way --
L373548	u6526	m433	TANK	Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
L373547	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We need an exit.
L373546	u6526	m433	TANK	Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
L373545	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Tank.
L373338	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Good.
L373337	u6526	m433	TANK	Now left and that's it in front of you.
L373336	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I need the main wet-wall.
L373335	u6526	m433	TANK	Got it.
L373087	u6526	m433	TANK	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
L373086	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	How is he?
L373299	u6524	m433	ORACLE	You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
L373298	u6523	m433	NEO	What?
L373297	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
L373295	u6523	m433	NEO	What do you mean, without him?
L373294	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
L373293	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
L373292	u6524	m433	ORACLE	What's funny?
L373291	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
L373290	u6523	m433	NEO	What?
L373289	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
L373288	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm not the One.
L373287	u6524	m433	ORACLE	But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
L373286	u6523	m433	NEO	But what?
L373285	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
L373281	u6523	m433	NEO	Honestly?  I don't know.
L373280	u6524	m433	ORACLE	So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
L373278	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Not too bright though.
L373277	u6523	m433	NEO	Who?
L373276	u6524	m433	ORACLE	You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
L373274	u6523	m433	NEO	How did you know...?
L373273	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
L373272	u6523	m433	NEO	Shit, I'm sorry.
L373271	u6524	m433	ORACLE	That vase.
L373270	u6523	m433	NEO	What vase?
L373269	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
L373268	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah.
L373267	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
L373266	u6523	m433	NEO	You're the Oracle?
L373265	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
L373264	u6523	m433	NEO	Hello?
L373525	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Not yet.
L373524	u6523	m433	NEO	Can you fly that thing.
L373523	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
L373522	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you all right?
L373521	u6523	m433	NEO	It wasn't fast enough.
L373520	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
L373519	u6523	m433	NEO	Do what?
L373518	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo, how did you do that?
L373490	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah?
L373489	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No one has ever done anything like this.
L373481	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
L373480	u6523	m433	NEO	No, you're not.
L373479	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I'm coming with you.
L373478	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373477	u6523	m433	NEO	I believe I can bring him back.
L373476	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373471	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Because...
L373470	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?
L373469	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
L373468	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
L373467	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No, you... have to be.
L373466	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
L373465	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373464	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
L373463	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
L373462	u6523	m433	NEO	I have to.
L373461	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You can't!
L373460	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm going in after him.
L373459	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What are you doing?
L373458	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What choice?
L373457	u6523	m433	NEO	That I would have to make a choice...
L373446	u6523	m433	NEO	There has to be something that we can do.
L373445	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
L373388	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't know.  It just went dead.
L373387	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What happened?
L373374	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
L373373	u6523	m433	NEO	Is Morpheus alive?
L373353	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We have to!
L373352	u6523	m433	NEO	We can't leave him!
L373351	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Go!
L373324	u6527	m433	TRINITY	A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
L373323	u6523	m433	NEO	What is it?
L373322	u6523	m433	NEO	It might have been.  I'm not sure.
L373321	u6527	m433	TRINITY	How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
L373320	u6523	m433	NEO	A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
L373319	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What happened?  What did you see?
L373318	u6523	m433	NEO	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
L373317	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What did you just say?
L373306	u6523	m433	NEO	... right as rain.
L373305	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you all right?
L373214	u6527	m433	TRINITY	She told me...
L373213	u6523	m433	NEO	What did she tell you?
L373212	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Yes.
L373211	u6523	m433	NEO	Did you go to her?
L373210	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No.
L373209	u6523	m433	NEO	Should I be?
L373208	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you worried?
L373207	u6523	m433	NEO	Is it?
L373206	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That's different.
L373205	u6523	m433	NEO	But an Oracle can.
L373204	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
L373203	u6523	m433	NEO	What does that mean?
L373201	u6523	m433	NEO	I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
L373200	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373199	u6523	m433	NEO	God...
L373158	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
L373157	u6523	m433	NEO	E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
L373054	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Easy, Neo.  Easy.
L373053	u6523	m433	NEO	Get this thing out of me!
L372993	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's going into replication.
L372992	u6523	m433	NEO	Uh-oh...
L372948	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
L372947	u6523	m433	NEO	What is this thing?
L372945	u6523	m433	NEO	... shit.
L372944	u6527	m433	TRINITY	And I know that's not where you want to be.
L372943	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
L372942	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?
L372941	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo, please, you have to trust me.
L372934	u6527	m433	TRINITY	From you.
L372933	u6523	m433	NEO	From what?
L372932	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
L372931	u6523	m433	NEO	What the hell is this?!
L372862	u6527	m433	TRINITY	When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
L372861	u6523	m433	NEO	What is the Matrix?
L372860	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
L372858	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
L372857	u6523	m433	NEO	Who is?
L372856	u6527	m433	TRINITY	They're watching you, Neo.
L372855	u6523	m433	NEO	Of what?
L372854	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
L372853	u6523	m433	NEO	How did you do that?
L372851	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
L372850	u6523	m433	NEO	Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
L372849	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Most guys do.
L372848	u6523	m433	NEO	I just thought... you were a guy.
L372847	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L372846	u6523	m433	NEO	Gee-zus.
L372845	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That was a long time ago.
L372844	u6523	m433	NEO	Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
L372843	u6527	m433	TRINITY	My name is Trinity.
L372842	u6523	m433	NEO	Who are you?
L372841	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
L372840	u6523	m433	NEO	How do you know that name?
L372839	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Hello, Neo.
L373606	u6526	m433	TANK	Kick it in!  Kick it in!
L373605	u6523	m433	NEO	It's locked.
L373598	u6526	m433	TANK	Duck!
L373597	u6523	m433	NEO	Which way?  Which way?
L373592	u6523	m433	NEO	Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
L373591	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373488	u6523	m433	NEO	Guns.  Lots of guns.
L373487	u6526	m433	TANK	Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
L373475	u6523	m433	NEO	Because I believe in something.
L373474	u6526	m433	TANK	Why?
L373473	u6523	m433	NEO	I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
L373472	u6526	m433	TANK	Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
L373456	u6523	m433	NEO	The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
L373455	u6526	m433	TANK	What are you talking about?
L373454	u6523	m433	NEO	Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
L373453	u6526	m433	TANK	Neo, this has to be done!
L373452	u6523	m433	NEO	Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
L373439	u6526	m433	TANK	Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
L373438	u6523	m433	NEO	What do they want?
L373437	u6526	m433	TANK	When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
L373436	u6526	m433	TANK	Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
L373435	u6523	m433	NEO	How much time?
L373434	u6526	m433	TANK	They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
L373433	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373432	u6526	m433	TANK	They're hacking his mind.
L373431	u6523	m433	NEO	What are they doing to him?
L373196	u6526	m433	TANK	The Oracle.
L373195	u6523	m433	NEO	See who?
L373085	u6523	m433	NEO	Hell yes!
L373084	u6526	m433	TANK	Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
L373083	u6523	m433	NEO	Holy shit!
L373077	u6526	m433	TANK	Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
L373076	u6523	m433	NEO	Where is it?
L373075	u6526	m433	TANK	The last human city.  The only place we got left.
L373074	u6523	m433	NEO	It's a city?
L373073	u6526	m433	TANK	If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
L373072	u6523	m433	NEO	Zion?
L373071	u6526	m433	TANK	Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
L373070	u6523	m433	NEO	You don't have...
L373069	u6526	m433	TANK	You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
L373068	u6523	m433	NEO	No.
L373067	u6526	m433	TANK	Morning.  Did you sleep?
L373620	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Hurry, Neo.
L373619	u6526	m433	TANK	They've burned through the outer shields.
L373580	u6526	m433	TANK	I don't know.  I lost him.
L373579	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What just happened?
L373565	u6526	m433	TANK	I can't!
L373564	u6527	m433	TRINITY	An Agent!  You have to send me back!
L373563	u6526	m433	TANK	What the hell just happened?
L373562	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo!
L373527	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
L373526	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373449	u6526	m433	TANK	Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
L373448	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
L373447	u6526	m433	TANK	There is.  We have to pull the plug.
L373419	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Dozer?
L373418	u6526	m433	TANK	I'll be all right.
L373417	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank, you're hurt.
L373381	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Got it.
L373380	u6526	m433	TANK	So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
L373379	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Cypher, I thought --
L373378	u6526	m433	TANK	You're not far from Cypher.
L373377	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We need an exit!
L373376	u6527	m433	TRINITY	He's alive.
L373375	u6526	m433	TANK	Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
L373372	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank, it's me.
L373371	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L388530	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Hugh, I'm impressed..
L388529	u6627	m442	STAMP	Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
L388285	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
L388284	u6627	m442	STAMP	Where is it?
L388283	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
L388282	u6627	m442	STAMP	I thought you were going to dinner.
L388174	u6627	m442	STAMP	Sean, please..
L388173	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
L388170	u6627	m442	STAMP	Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
L388169	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
L388168	u6627	m442	STAMP	Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
L388167	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	From her point of view or mine?
L388166	u6627	m442	STAMP	Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
L387881	u6627	m442	STAMP	Not possible..
L387880	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
L387879	u6627	m442	STAMP	All done, chief..
L387878	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
L388469	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
L388468	u6626	m442	NYAH	What are you talking about?
L388467	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
L388466	u6626	m442	NYAH	If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
L388465	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
L388464	u6626	m442	NYAH	Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
L388463	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Feel like pleading for your life?
L388281	u6626	m442	NYAH	Lovely.
L388280	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
L388279	u6626	m442	NYAH	Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
L388278	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
L388277	u6626	m442	NYAH	A change of plans?
L388276	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
L388275	u6626	m442	NYAH	Sort it all out.
L388274	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	To do what?
L388273	u6626	m442	NYAH	I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
L388272	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Then don't say it.
L388271	u6626	m442	NYAH	Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
L388264	u6626	m442	NYAH	Well, that's good, isn't?
L388263	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	You picked another winner!
L388228	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	What else?
L388227	u6626	m442	NYAH	To win?
L388220	u6626	m442	NYAH	Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
L388219	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	See anything you like?
L388182	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
L388181	u6626	m442	NYAH	'Thief in the Night?'
L388180	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
L388179	u6626	m442	NYAH	I suppose I did.
L388178	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	You won.
L388158	u6626	m442	NYAH	Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
L388157	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
L388156	u6626	m442	NYAH	Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
L388155	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
L388147	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Oh, I am.  Later..
L388146	u6626	m442	NYAH	You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
L388143	u6626	m442	NYAH	And my room?
L388142	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Mmmm.
L388141	u6626	m442	NYAH	Your room.
L388125	u6626	m442	NYAH	Ahh..
L388124	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Magic...
L388123	u6626	m442	NYAH	How do you that.
L388122	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	How I usually find you, Nyah.
L388121	u6626	m442	NYAH	How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
L388120	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	On what.
L388119	u6626	m442	NYAH	Well that depends.
L388118	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	How grateful?
L388117	u6626	m442	NYAH	I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
L388116	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Not much luggage.
L388510	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
L388509	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
L388505	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	In downtown Sydney for a start.
L388504	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	Where?
L388503	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
L388502	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	What are you talking about?
L388501	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
L388500	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
L388433	u6622	m442	ETHAN	In other words, you're calling her a flake.
L388432	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
L388429	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
L388428	u6622	m442	ETHAN	She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
L388427	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
L388426	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
L388425	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Why, you going to make me a better offer?
L388424	u6622	m442	ETHAN	What was the top bid?
L388423	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
L388422	u6622	m442	ETHAN	There it is, guys, the last of it.
L388420	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
L388419	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	I knew where it was.
L388418	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
L388417	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
L388416	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
L388415	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	And you're happy about that?
L388414	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Fight a bit of a cold..
L388351	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
L388350	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
L388222	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
L388221	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Nyah!
L388508	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
L388507	u6629	m442	WALLIS	Ninety-three point four million.
L388506	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
L388490	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	In any case we don't want your cash.
L388489	u6629	m442	WALLIS	More like two-two point two million.
L388488	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	Not exactly.  Wallis?
L387883	u6619	m442	AMBROSE	It's that time.  Go.
L387882	u6629	m442	WALLIS	Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
L388477	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
L388476	u6620	m442	BILLY	What are you talking about?
L388475	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
L388201	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
L388200	u6620	m442	BILLY	Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
L388137	u6620	m442	BILLY	Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
L388136	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
L388135	u6620	m442	BILLY	Well do you disagree with that?
L388133	u6620	m442	BILLY	- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
L388132	u6622	m442	ETHAN	..or hard wired..
L388131	u6620	m442	BILLY	Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
L388130	u6622	m442	ETHAN	A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
L388129	u6620	m442	BILLY	What you got there, mate?
L388109	u6622	m442	ETHAN	It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
L388108	u6620	m442	BILLY	Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
L388585	u6620	m442	BILLY	Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
L388584	u6623	m442	LUTHER	And the check's in the mall.
L388583	u6620	m442	BILLY	That's it?  That's it? That's it?
L388554	u6623	m442	LUTHER	We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
L388553	u6620	m442	BILLY	There she is.  I got visual.
L388552	u6620	m442	BILLY	I hope there's a place to land.
L388551	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Range is two kay.
L388523	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Not for seven more minutes.
L388522	u6620	m442	BILLY	We're due to take off.
L388474	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Right.
L388473	u6620	m442	BILLY	Before we kill her or cure her..
L388381	u6623	m442	LUTHER	..in the building...
L388380	u6620	m442	BILLY	Exactly where is she?
L388379	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
L388360	u6623	m442	LUTHER	I'm not ready!
L388359	u6620	m442	BILLY	Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
L388328	u6620	m442	BILLY	There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
L388327	u6623	m442	LUTHER	So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
L388288	u6623	m442	LUTHER	What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
L388287	u6620	m442	BILLY	Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
L388114	u6620	m442	BILLY	Then we got'em!
L388113	u6623	m442	LUTHER	It is, Billy.
L388405	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
L388404	u6621	m442	BILLY'S VOICE	What can we do' mate?
L388403	u6623	m442	LUTHER	He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
L388402	u6621	m442	BILLY'S VOICE	How're we doin', then?
L388395	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
L388394	u6621	m442	BILLY'S VOICE	How much longer before you can reach him?
L388393	u6623	m442	LUTHER	She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
L388383	u6623	m442	LUTHER	I am. She is.
L388382	u6621	m442	BILLY'S VOICE	Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
L388247	u6621	m442	BILLY'S VOICE	He's heading down the stairs, now..
L388246	u6623	m442	LUTHER	I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
L388590	u6622	m442	ETHAN	No...
L388589	u6626	m442	NYAH	No.  You just looked as if you did.
L388588	u6622	m442	ETHAN	No.  Should I?
L388445	u6626	m442	NYAH	I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
L388444	u6622	m442	ETHAN	No.
L388443	u6626	m442	NYAH	Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
L388442	u6622	m442	ETHAN	No.
L388441	u6626	m442	NYAH	I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
L388440	u6622	m442	ETHAN	- you who don't have a conscience.
L388439	u6626	m442	NYAH	I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
L388438	u6622	m442	ETHAN	What did you think you were doing!
L388326	u6622	m442	ETHAN	No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
L388325	u6626	m442	NYAH	What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
L388324	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
L388323	u6626	m442	NYAH	Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
L388308	u6622	m442	ETHAN	It's going to be okay.
L388307	u6626	m442	NYAH	I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
L388306	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Are you okay?
L388305	u6626	m442	NYAH	Oh Ethan!..
L388304	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
L388259	u6622	m442	ETHAN	He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
L388258	u6626	m442	NYAH	How do you suggest I go about it?
L388257	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
L388255	u6626	m442	NYAH	Ethan, tell me -
L388254	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
L388252	u6626	m442	NYAH	Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
L388251	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I want <i>you out of there.</i>
L388239	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
L388238	u6626	m442	NYAH	I managed.
L388218	u6626	m442	NYAH	I'll muddle through.
L388217	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
L388216	u6626	m442	NYAH	Where do I meet you?
L388215	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Affirmative.
L388214	u6626	m442	NYAH	-- his left jacket pocket.
L388205	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
L388204	u6626	m442	NYAH	Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
L388199	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I've no doubt.
L388198	u6626	m442	NYAH	Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
L388197	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Have you met them?
L388196	u6626	m442	NYAH	- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
L388195	u6622	m442	ETHAN	We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
L388192	u6626	m442	NYAH	Just about..
L388191	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Just like old times?
L388190	u6626	m442	NYAH	Just like old times.
L388189	u6622	m442	ETHAN	How's it going?  Everything okay?
L388099	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
L388098	u6626	m442	NYAH	Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
L388097	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
L388096	u6626	m442	NYAH	Yes?
L388095	u6622	m442	ETHAN	He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
L388094	u6626	m442	NYAH	Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
L388093	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You don't trust me.
L388092	u6626	m442	NYAH	How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
L388091	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Before you are.
L388083	u6626	m442	NYAH	Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
L388082	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
L388081	u6626	m442	NYAH	This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
L388080	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
L388076	u6626	m442	NYAH	Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
L388075	u6622	m442	ETHAN	What wouldn't make him suspicious?
L388074	u6626	m442	NYAH	Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
L388073	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Then feel better!..
L388072	u6626	m442	NYAH	Much.
L388071	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
L388070	u6626	m442	NYAH	Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
L388069	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Can you think of a better one?
L388068	u6626	m442	NYAH	And that's the only reason?
L388067	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
L388066	u6626	m442	NYAH	Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
L388065	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I don't.
L388064	u6626	m442	NYAH	No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
L388063	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You can be a thief and have a conscience.
L388062	u6626	m442	NYAH	But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
L388061	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Something like that.
L388060	u6626	m442	NYAH	You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
L388059	u6622	m442	ETHAN	So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
L388058	u6626	m442	NYAH	I'd like a little more conviction..
L388057	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
L388056	u6626	m442	NYAH	But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
L388055	u6622	m442	ETHAN	This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
L388054	u6626	m442	NYAH	Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
L388052	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Sean Ambrose, for one.
L388051	u6626	m442	NYAH	That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
L388050	u6622	m442	ETHAN	And six billion in the world.
L388049	u6626	m442	NYAH	There's nearly 2 million in London.
L388048	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Five, six-hundred thousand.
L388047	u6626	m442	NYAH	What's the population of Seville any idea?
L387988	u6626	m442	NYAH	That's because I'm on my back.
L387987	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Damn, you're beautiful.
L387986	u6626	m442	NYAH	Ask a question, you get an answer!..
L387985	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Of what?
L387984	u6626	m442	NYAH	Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
L387983	u6622	m442	ETHAN	So do I.  Sort of.
L387982	u6626	m442	NYAH	Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
L387981	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
L387980	u6626	m442	NYAH	You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
L387979	u6622	m442	ETHAN	So where did I got right?
L387978	u6626	m442	NYAH	That they're lying.
L387977	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Which is?
L387976	u6626	m442	NYAH	That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
L387975	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
L387974	u6626	m442	NYAH	The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
L387973	u6622	m442	ETHAN	They've got a book for everything.
L387972	u6626	m442	NYAH	They've got a book for this?
L387971	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
L387970	u6626	m442	NYAH	When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
L387968	u6626	m442	NYAH	Who wants to be decent?..
L387967	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Care to wait a decent interval?
L387966	u6626	m442	NYAH	Awfully short notice..
L387964	u6626	m442	NYAH	Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
L387963	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Ethan Hunt.
L387962	u6626	m442	NYAH	What's you name?
L387955	u6626	m442	NYAH	Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
L387954	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
L387953	u6626	m442	NYAH	Your help?  What are you talking about?
L387952	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
L387951	u6626	m442	NYAH	Listen to what?
L387950	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
L387948	u6626	m442	NYAH	Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
L387947	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
L387946	u6626	m442	NYAH	Hola..
L387943	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
L387942	u6626	m442	NYAH	You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
L387941	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You didn't do that badly.
L387940	u6626	m442	NYAH	Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
L387939	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
L387938	u6626	m442	NYAH	May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
L387937	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
L387936	u6626	m442	NYAH	If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
L387935	u6622	m442	ETHAN	At least you walked.
L387934	u6626	m442	NYAH	I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
L387931	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
L387930	u6626	m442	NYAH	Indeed.
L387929	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
L387922	u6626	m442	NYAH	Do what?
L387921	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I wouldn't do that.
L387920	u6626	m442	NYAH	- right..
L387919	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
L387918	u6626	m442	NYAH	- this is very disconerting..
L387917	u6622	m442	ETHAN	- torque wrench.
L387916	u6626	m442	NYAH	Where's the bloody -
L387915	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Far right.
L387914	u6626	m442	NYAH	- right..where is it?
L387910	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Oh, either way works for me.
L387909	u6626	m442	NYAH	Would you mind if I'm on top?
L387907	u6626	m442	NYAH	I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
L387906	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
L387905	u6626	m442	NYAH	What are you doing here?
L387901	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Uh-huh?
L387900	u6626	m442	NYAH	Uh-huh.
L387899	u6622	m442	ETHAN	What if I pay the rent?
L387898	u6626	m442	NYAH	Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
L387897	u6622	m442	ETHAN	There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
L387896	u6626	m442	NYAH	Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
L387895	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
L387894	u6626	m442	NYAH	No.  Just as if I'd like to.
L387893	u6622	m442	ETHAN	No.  You just looked as if you did.
L387892	u6626	m442	NYAH	No.  Should I?
L387891	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Do you know me?
L388579	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
L388578	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
L388577	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
L388576	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I don't.  No exactly.
L388575	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
L388574	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I do.
L388573	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
L388572	u6622	m442	ETHAN	No, I don't.  But in this case -
L388570	u6622	m442	ETHAN	By fire.  That's the best way, really.
L388569	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
L388568	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
L388567	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
L388566	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Yes.
L388565	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
L388564	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Yes, I gathered as much.
L388563	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
L388562	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
L388561	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
L388560	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
L388559	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
L388462	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
L388461	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
L388460	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Something else?
L388459	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
L388458	u6622	m442	ETHAN	She sacrificed herself..
L388457	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
L388455	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
L388454	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
L388453	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
L388452	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Yes, I believe that's right.
L388451	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
L388450	u6622	m442	ETHAN	We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
L388449	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
L388448	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
L388044	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
L388043	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Very.
L388042	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	You mean it'll be difficult.
L388041	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I don't think I can get her to do it.
L388040	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
L388039	u6622	m442	ETHAN	She's got no training for this kind of thing.
L388038	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
L388037	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
L388036	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
L388035	u6622	m442	ETHAN	And then what?
L388034	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
L388033	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Excuse me?
L388032	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	- is where Miss Hall comes in.
L388031	u6622	m442	ETHAN	If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
L388030	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
L388029	u6622	m442	ETHAN	'Terrorists?'
L388028	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
L388027	u6622	m442	ETHAN	In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
L388026	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
L388025	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Right now only Ambrose knows that.
L388024	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
L388023	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
L388022	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
L388021	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
L388020	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Then you do think it was Ambrose.
L388019	u6622	m442	ETHAN	So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
L388017	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Not necessarily.
L388016	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
L388015	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	What did you think of him?
L388014	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Twice.
L388013	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
L388012	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	You were there.
L388011	u6622	m442	ETHAN	If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
L388010	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
L388009	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
L388008	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Like?
L388007	u6622	m442	ETHAN	An idea, yeah.
L388000	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You gotta be kidding.
L387999	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
L387998	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Like what?
L387997	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Why did you phrase it like that?
L387996	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
L387995	u6628	m442	SWANBECK	Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
L387994	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
L388003	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	I'm fine..
L388002	u6622	m442	ETHAN	..I'm fine..and you?
L387875	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
L387874	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
L387868	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
L387867	u6622	m442	ETHAN	..not in time to save him.
L387866	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	Yes, he knew.  Just..
L387865	u6622	m442	ETHAN	He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
L387864	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
L387863	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
L387862	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
L387861	u6622	m442	ETHAN	They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
L387860	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
L387859	u6622	m442	ETHAN	You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
L388582	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Good job.  And thanks.
L388581	u6623	m442	LUTHER	So what did he say?
L388544	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
L388543	u6623	m442	LUTHER	She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
L388542	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Luther, say again.
L388472	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
L388471	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
L388366	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
L388365	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Luther, I'm looking at security.
L388357	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
L388356	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
L388349	u6623	m442	LUTHER	No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
L388348	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Now how to get in there.
L388345	u6623	m442	LUTHER	All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
L388344	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Let's start from the inside out.
L388341	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Nyah still on the property?
L388340	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
L388332	u6623	m442	LUTHER	You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
L388331	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
L388330	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
L388329	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
L388291	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I told her to get outta there.
L388290	u6623	m442	LUTHER	She must still be on the property.
L388289	u6622	m442	ETHAN	I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
L388213	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
L388212	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Left jacket pocket confirmed.
L388211	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
L388210	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Roger that.
L388209	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Left jacket pocket?
L388208	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
L388203	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Yep.
L388202	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Nekhorvich's boss?
L388160	u6623	m442	LUTHER	Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
L388159	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
L388152	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Why not?
L388151	u6623	m442	LUTHER	That simple, huh?
L388150	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
L388104	u6623	m442	LUTHER	The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
L388103	u6622	m442	ETHAN	Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
L388102	u6623	m442	LUTHER	It's the transponder.
L388322	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
L388321	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
L388320	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
L388319	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
L388318	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	By asking me.
L388317	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
L388316	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
L388315	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
L388314	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	Do I?
L388313	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	You have Bellerophon.
L388298	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
L388297	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
L388296	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
L388295	u6624	m442	MCCLOY	What's happening here?  You're dead!
L388294	u6625	m442	NEKHORVICH	A visit from an old friend.
L388613	u6636	m443	KASIMOV	Yes, Anatoly, yes.
L388612	u6630	m443	ANATOLY	To friends.
L388609	u6630	m443	ANATOLY	Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
L388608	u6636	m443	KASIMOV	His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
L388607	u6630	m443	ANATOLY	Come on!
L388603	u6636	m443	KASIMOV	You're right, of course.
L388602	u6630	m443	ANATOLY	You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
L388601	u6636	m443	KASIMOV	They'll kill me.
L388600	u6630	m443	ANATOLY	C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
L388595	u6636	m443	KASIMOV	I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
L388594	u6630	m443	ANATOLY	Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
L389160	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Good idea.
L389159	u6631	m443	BARNES	Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
L389158	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	This is bullshit - we dont even know what Max looks like.
L389157	u6631	m443	BARNES	Nothing but civilians, Gene.
L389143	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	I dont know.  It didnt say on the tickets.
L389142	u6631	m443	BARNES	What kind of show.
L389141	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
L389140	u6631	m443	BARNES	But why tell us?
L389139	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
L389138	u6631	m443	BARNES	Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
L389137	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
L389136	u6631	m443	BARNES	Only four more cars.
L389024	u6631	m443	BARNES	What about him...?
L389023	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
L389018	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Okay!
L389017	u6631	m443	BARNES	Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
L389016	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
L388983	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	S.O.P..
L388982	u6631	m443	BARNES	That's S.O.P..
L388920	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodys got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
L388919	u6631	m443	BARNES	So what do you suggest?
L388918	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
L388917	u6631	m443	BARNES	Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
L388916	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
L389201	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Yes.
L389200	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
L389199	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Dont Jim.
L389192	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Fold it.  Fold it tight.
L389191	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	All ten million.
L389190	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Satisfied?
L389183	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
L389182	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
L389179	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer.
L389178	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
L389177	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisll have to be quicker than Id like. Certainly quicker than youd like.
L389174	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
L389173	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	You knew about Jim?
L389032	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
L389031	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Krieger.
L389030	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
L388949	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	May take a little time.
L388948	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Krieger can get it.  Right?
L388937	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
L388936	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Always.
L388935	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	Is he serious?
L389208	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I always have, Claire..
L389207	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
L389206	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Claire.
L389205	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	This stuff is so sticky.
L389204	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Claire...Hey...
L389171	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Ethan?
L389170	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
L389169	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
L389147	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
L389146	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Two cars.  Where are you?
L389145	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
L389144	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
L389122	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
L389121	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Is this the only way?
L389120	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Okay...
L389119	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
L389118	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What happened?
L389067	u6633	m443	ETHAN	He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
L389066	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What are you going to do?
L389064	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Bastard!
L389063	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Kittridge...
L389045	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	I'm going to try and get some sleep.
L389044	u6633	m443	ETHAN	We did what we had to do.
L389043	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
L388971	u6633	m443	ETHAN	What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
L388970	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What about you?
L388969	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I just need you to be safe.
L388968	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	You didn't have to.........
L388967	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I didn't say that.
L388966	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	You don't think we're going to make it.
L388965	u6633	m443	ETHAN	It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
L388964	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Sure...
L388963	u6633	m443	ETHAN	May I come in?
L388927	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What kind of help?
L388926	u6633	m443	ETHAN	We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
L388925	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
L388924	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You're sure about this?
L388923	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
L388922	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
L388921	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Max made a deal with you?
L388856	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I'm going to answer it.
L388855	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	The message is for Job.
L388854	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
L388853	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
L388852	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
L388851	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What are you going to do?
L388850	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
L388849	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Why haven't they brought us in yet?
L388848	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
L388847	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
L388846	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Who is they, who is they?
L388845	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Did they send you...Did they send you?
L388844	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	"Who is ""they?"""
L388843	u6633	m443	ETHAN	That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
L388842	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
L388841	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Where were you?
L388840	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Take off your God damn coat!
L388839	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What?
L388838	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Take off your coat.
L388837	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	They're dead.  Jim's dead.
L388835	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What happened to Jim?
L388834	u6633	m443	ETHAN	There was nobody on the bridge.
L388833	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	What happened to Jim?
L388832	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
L388831	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
L388830	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
L388829	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
L388828	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You were in the car!
L388827	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Don't move.
L388826	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
L388734	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Roger that.
L388733	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
L388625	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Oh yeah?
L388624	u6633	m443	ETHAN	If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
L388623	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
L388622	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Sleeping's better.
L388621	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Talking's good, walking's better.
L388620	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	I'm walking.
L388619	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
L388618	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
L388617	u6633	m443	ETHAN	We got it.  On your feet.
L388616	u6632	m443	CLAIRE	Did we get it?
L389078	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
L389077	u6633	m443	ETHAN	If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
L389076	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Certainly Ethan.
L389075	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
L389070	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
L389069	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I see you've been out visiting the folks.
L389068	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Kittridge.
L388817	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
L388816	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
L388815	u6633	m443	ETHAN	How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
L388814	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
L388812	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
L388811	u6633	m443	ETHAN	This whole operation was a molehunt.
L388810	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	"Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  ""Golitsyn"" was a lightning rod, one of ours."
L388809	u6633	m443	ETHAN	But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
L388808	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	"That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as ""Job 314"".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight."
L388807	u6633	m443	ETHAN	The arms dealer.
L388806	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	"For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as ""Max."""
L388805	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
L388804	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
L388803	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	I don't quite follow you.
L388802	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
L388801	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	What?
L388800	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Why was there another team?
L388799	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Yes.  I see your point.
L388798	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Who else is left?
L388797	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
L388796	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
L388795	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	We've lost enough agents for one night.
L388794	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Yeah.  I follow you.
L388793	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
L388792	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Yeah.
L388791	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
L388790	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	One hour.
L388789	u6633	m443	ETHAN	No sir.
L388788	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
L388787	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Youre in Prague?
L388786	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
L388785	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Yes.
L388784	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
L388783	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I dont think so.
L388782	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
L388781	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
L388780	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	<u>Are you intact</u>?
L388779	u6633	m443	ETHAN	They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns dead too.  The disk is gone.
L388778	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Are you damaged?
L388777	u6633	m443	ETHAN	My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
L388776	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Whos dead?
L388775	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Theyre dead.
L388774	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	Go ahead.
L388773	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Go secure.
L388772	u6637	m443	KITTRIDGE	This is Kittridge.
L389236	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
L389235	u6639	m443	LUTHER	Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
L389234	u6633	m443	ETHAN	He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
L389233	u6639	m443	LUTHER	You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
L389232	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
L389231	u6639	m443	LUTHER	Why don't you come back with me?
L389230	u6633	m443	ETHAN	It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
L389229	u6639	m443	LUTHER	I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
L389228	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
L389227	u6639	m443	LUTHER	Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
L389226	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
L389225	u6639	m443	LUTHER	Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
L389224	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
L389222	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
L389221	u6639	m443	LUTHER	The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
L389220	u6633	m443	ETHAN	About what?
L389219	u6639	m443	LUTHER	Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
L389053	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I'll get you close.
L389052	u6639	m443	LUTHER	It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
L389051	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
L389050	u6639	m443	LUTHER	I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
L389049	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
L389048	u6639	m443	LUTHER	What makes you trust me?
L389047	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Now I want you to hold onto it.
L389046	u6639	m443	LUTHER	Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
L388956	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
L388955	u6639	m443	LUTHER	I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
L388954	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
L388953	u6639	m443	LUTHER	And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
L388951	u6639	m443	LUTHER	Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
L388950	u6633	m443	ETHAN	May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
L388947	u6639	m443	LUTHER	You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
L388946	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
L388945	u6639	m443	LUTHER	There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
L388944	u6633	m443	ETHAN	This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
L388941	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Profitable.
L388940	u6639	m443	LUTHER	What kind?
L388939	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Information.
L388938	u6639	m443	LUTHER	What are we downloading?
L389135	u6641	m443	MAX	I wouldnt worry about him.  Once youve got the money -- hell find you.
L389134	u6633	m443	ETHAN	What about Job?
L389133	u6641	m443	MAX	The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
L389132	u6633	m443	ETHAN	It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
L389131	u6641	m443	MAX	Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
L388915	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I wouldn't dream of it.
L388914	u6641	m443	MAX	I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
L388913	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
L388912	u6641	m443	MAX	How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
L388911	u6633	m443	ETHAN	How will you make sure Job will be there?
L388910	u6641	m443	MAX	Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
L388909	u6633	m443	ETHAN	<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
L388908	u6641	m443	MAX	Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
L388907	u6633	m443	ETHAN	What was your deal with Job?
L388906	u6641	m443	MAX	I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
L388905	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
L388894	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
L388893	u6641	m443	MAX	Very good.
L388892	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
L388891	u6641	m443	MAX	Mm - Hmmm...
L388890	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
L388889	u6641	m443	MAX	It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
L388888	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
L388887	u6641	m443	MAX	Why should I?
L388886	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
L388885	u6641	m443	MAX	I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
L388884	u6633	m443	ETHAN	That's the question I want to ask Job.
L388883	u6641	m443	MAX	Why, may I ask?
L388882	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
L388881	u6641	m443	MAX	Ah, but, we're asking about you.
L388880	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Like Job?
L388879	u6641	m443	MAX	And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
L388878	u6633	m443	ETHAN	The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
L388877	u6641	m443	MAX	It's quite out of the question.
L388876	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
L388875	u6641	m443	MAX	On what?
L388874	u6633	m443	ETHAN	That depends.
L388873	u6641	m443	MAX	The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
L388872	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
L388871	u6641	m443	MAX	Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
L388870	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I need one hundred thousand dollars.
L388869	u6641	m443	MAX	Who are you and what are you doing here?
L388995	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Let's move!
L388994	u6634	m443	GUARD RANDALL	Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
L388990	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
L388989	u6634	m443	GUARD RANDALL	Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
L388988	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I gotta go in there and shut it down!
L388987	u6634	m443	GUARD RANDALL	Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
L388986	u6633	m443	ETHAN	What sector's the air conditioning?
L389035	u6633	m443	ETHAN	What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
L389034	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	That's not it.  That's not the list.
L389029	u6633	m443	ETHAN	My contact is extremely shy.
L389028	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	You're not going to any meeting without me.
L389015	u6633	m443	ETHAN	We're not outta here yet.
L389014	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	Merci.
L389002	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Time up.
L389001	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	We'll see.
L389000	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Zero body count.
L388932	u6633	m443	ETHAN	In Langley.
L388931	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	Where exactly is it?
L388930	u6633	m443	ETHAN	IMF mainframe.
L388929	u6638	m443	KRIEGER	Bank?
L388928	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
L388737	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.
L388736	u6635	m443	JACK	Roger that.  Opening doors now.
L388735	u6633	m443	ETHAN	In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
L388730	u6635	m443	JACK	Give me a break, Pops.
L388729	u6633	m443	ETHAN	He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
L388723	u6635	m443	JACK	I didn't touch it.
L388722	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Jack.  Jack.
L388687	u6635	m443	JACK	Just don't chew it.
L388686	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Give me the God damn gum.
L388682	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Always.
L388681	u6635	m443	JACK	Sorry, am I interrupting?
L388629	u6635	m443	JACK	Just waiting for you, tubs.
L388628	u6633	m443	ETHAN	IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
L388627	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Jack.
L388626	u6635	m443	JACK	Claire.
L388761	u6633	m443	ETHAN	No, were going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
L388760	u6643	m443	SARAH	Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
L388759	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
L388755	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Jim we cant.
L388754	u6643	m443	SARAH	Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
L388750	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
L388749	u6643	m443	SARAH	The package is in the open.
L388726	u6643	m443	SARAH	What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
L388725	u6633	m443	ETHAN	OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
L388719	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Right, right.  Good.
L388718	u6643	m443	SARAH	Higher.
L388717	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Higher.  Higher.
L388900	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I'd say you've got about two minutes.
L388899	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Forty-four.  Forty-five.
L388868	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Very well.
L388867	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I'm willing to take the chance.
L388866	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
L388865	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
L388864	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
L388863	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Then what am I doing here?
L388862	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
L388861	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I thought I was going to see Max.
L388860	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
L388859	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Why?
L388858	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Would you remove your hat please?
L389203	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Ethan - Ive always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
L389202	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Jim, its over.
L389196	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
L389195	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
L389194	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Dont flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
L389193	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
L389188	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Keep counting Claire.
L389187	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
L389181	u6642	m443	PHELPS	"But, he didnt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  ""Thou shall not covet thy Neighbours wife"", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - ""does she feel the same way I do?"""
L389180	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I knew about Jim.
L389176	u6642	m443	PHELPS	They stamped it, didnt they?  Those damn Gideons.
L389175	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
L389117	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Good luck.
L389116	u6633	m443	ETHAN	And get a doctor.
L389115	u6642	m443	PHELPS	You got it.
L389114	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
L389113	u6642	m443	PHELPS	I usually am.
L389112	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Youre probably right.
L389111	u6642	m443	PHELPS	- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
L389110	u6642	m443	PHELPS	I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
L389109	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Jim...?
L389108	u6633	m443	ETHAN	If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
L389107	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
L389106	u6633	m443	ETHAN	A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
L389105	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
L389104	u6633	m443	ETHAN	What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
L389103	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Whats going to make him do that?
L389102	u6633	m443	ETHAN	We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
L389101	u6642	m443	PHELPS	..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
L389094	u6633	m443	ETHAN	How did Kittridge do it?..
L389093	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Yeah.
L389092	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
L389091	u6642	m443	PHELPS	I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
L389090	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
L389089	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I remember..
L389088	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Hey, I showed 'em to you!
L389087	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
L389086	u6642	m443	PHELPS	- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
L389085	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
L389084	u6642	m443	PHELPS	- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
L389083	u6633	m443	ETHAN	- and picked us up in the States -
L389082	u6642	m443	PHELPS	..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
L388764	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Theyre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
L388763	u6633	m443	ETHAN	About two hundred yards from the bridge.
L388762	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Where are you?
L388757	u6633	m443	ETHAN	<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyns on the move.
L388756	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Abort.  Thats an order.
L388753	u6642	m443	PHELPS	No.  Abort.
L388752	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Can you lose him?
L388751	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Ive got a shadow.
L388711	u6633	m443	ETHAN	We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
L388710	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
L388680	u6642	m443	PHELPS	If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
L388679	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Sure.  If the main character does.
L388678	u6642	m443	PHELPS	No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
L388677	u6633	m443	ETHAN	He won't be back in a hurry?
L388676	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
L388675	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
L388674	u6642	m443	PHELPS	He's our guy.
L388673	u6633	m443	ETHAN	You're going to use Walter?
L388669	u6642	m443	PHELPS	"Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says ""All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?""  She says no. ""Oh, it was my friend Sammy.""  She says it wasn't Sammy.  ""Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou.""  ""No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"""
L388668	u6633	m443	ETHAN	How was Chicago?
L388667	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
L388666	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Why not?
L388665	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
L388664	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I guess.
L388663	u6642	m443	PHELPS	Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
L388662	u6633	m443	ETHAN	What problem?
L388661	u6642	m443	PHELPS	When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
L388660	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Tell you what?
L388659	u6642	m443	PHELPS	I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
L388658	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Oh?  What's the problem?
L388657	u6642	m443	PHELPS	What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
L388656	u6633	m443	ETHAN	I thought I'd take some now.
L388655	u6642	m443	PHELPS	A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
L388654	u6633	m443	ETHAN	Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
L388732	u6635	m443	JACK	And a lonely ass.
L388731	u6643	m443	SARAH	Such a nice ass.
L388653	u6643	m443	SARAH	I think I might just take that look.
L388652	u6635	m443	JACK	Too wicked to have a drink later?
L388651	u6643	m443	SARAH	Jack you're so wicked.
L388650	u6635	m443	JACK	That's what we do isn't it?
L388649	u6643	m443	SARAH	Jack...that's spying.
L388648	u6635	m443	JACK	Why don't you take a look?
L388647	u6643	m443	SARAH	I don't know.
L388646	u6635	m443	JACK	What's going on?
L388645	u6643	m443	SARAH	Loud and clear.
L388644	u6635	m443	JACK	No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
L388643	u6643	m443	SARAH	Of course I can hear you.
L388642	u6635	m443	JACK	Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
L389163	u6641	m443	MAX	Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
L389162	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Its working.
L389156	u6641	m443	MAX	Run it through from the top.
L389155	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	I always check the batteries.
L389154	u6641	m443	MAX	Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
L389153	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Its not working.
L389152	u6641	m443	MAX	Try it again.
L389151	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Connection denied.
L389150	u6641	m443	MAX	Whats the problem.
L389129	u6641	m443	MAX	This wasnt what we discussed.
L389128	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Yes...  Its him.
L389127	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Twenty minutes.
L389126	u6641	m443	MAX	How long until we reach the Chunnel?
L388898	u6641	m443	MAX	Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
L388897	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Thirty-two and change.
L388896	u6641	m443	MAX	That's not so good for you, my friend.
L388895	u6640	m443	MATTHIAS	Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
L392086	u6663	m445	ALL	Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
L392085	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
L392084	u6663	m445	ALL	No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
L392083	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Does wood sink in water?
L392082	u6663	m445	ALL	Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
L392079	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
L392078	u6663	m445	ALL	I see.  Yes, of course.
L392073	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	And what do you burn, apart from witches?
L392072	u6663	m445	ALL	Burn them.
L392071	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
L392070	u6663	m445	ALL	There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
L392069	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
L392068	u6663	m445	ALL	Burn her anyway.
L392062	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Did you dress her up like this?
L392061	u6663	m445	ALL	A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
L392051	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Bring her forward.
L392050	u6663	m445	ALL	She looks like one. Yes, she does.
L392049	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	How do you know she is a witch?
L391905	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	I'm not interested.
L391904	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Am I right?
L391903	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Please!
L391902	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
L391901	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
L391900	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
L391897	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
L391896	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Not at all.  They could be carried.
L391895	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
L391894	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
L391893	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Well, this is a temperate zone.
L391892	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What do you mean?
L391891	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
L391890	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Through ... We found them.
L391889	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Where did you get the coconuts?
L391888	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
L391887	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
L391886	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	...What?
L391885	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	You're using coconuts!
L391884	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Yes!
L391883	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	What?  Ridden on a horse?
L391882	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
L391881	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Get away!
L391880	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
L391879	u6686	m445	SOLDIER	Halt!  Who goes there?
L392283	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
L392282	u6687	m445	SOOTHSAYER	Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
L392281	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
L392280	u6687	m445	SOOTHSAYER	There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
L392279	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
L392278	u6687	m445	SOOTHSAYER	He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
L392277	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
L391991	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
L391990	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	Well, how did you become king, then?
L391989	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You don't vote for kings.
L391988	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	Well, I didn't vote for you.
L391987	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	I am your king!
L391986	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
L391977	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What?
L391976	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	We don't have a lord.
L391975	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Well, who is your lord?
L391974	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	No one live there.
L391973	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
L391968	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	All of us are ... we are all Britons.
L391967	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	Who are the Britons?
L391966	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	The Britons.
L391965	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	King of the WHO?
L391964	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
L391963	u6680	m445	OLD WOMAN	Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
L392526	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	"No, no ... not ""is""!"
L392525	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	"What, ""is""?"
L392524	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	You said it again!
L392523	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
L392522	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
L392521	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What word?
L392518	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
L392517	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	Oh, please!
L392516	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
L392491	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
L392490	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What is that?
L392489	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
L392488	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
L392311	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	Now - go!
L392310	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Yes ...
L392309	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	And not too expensive.
L392308	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Of course.
L392307	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	One that looks nice.
L392306	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
L392305	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
L392304	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
L392303	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
L392302	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	A what?
L392301	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	We want ... a shrubbery!
L392300	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	All right!  What do you want?
L392299	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
L392298	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Oh!
L392297	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	NI!   NI!
L392296	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Oh!
L392295	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	NI!
L392294	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	"Knights Who Say ""Ni"" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ..."
L392291	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!
L392290	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Who are they?
L392289	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	The same!
L392045	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Come, Patsy.
L392044	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	All right, we'll call it a draw.
L392043	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
L392042	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You're a looney.
L392041	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	I'm invincible!
L392040	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What are you going to do. bleed on me?
L392039	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	Come Here.
L392038	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You'll what ... ?
L392037	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	I'll do you for that.
L392036	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	I'll have your leg.
L392035	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	Had enough ... ?
L392034	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Stop that.
L392033	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	What!  Just a flesh wound. 
L392032	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Look!
L392031	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	Course I have.
L392030	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
L392029	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	Had enough?
L392028	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
L392027	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What?
L392026	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	Come on then.
L392025	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
L392024	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	Come on you pansy!
L392023	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You're a liar.
L392022	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	I've had worse.
L392021	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Well, what's that then?
L392020	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	No, it isn't.
L392019	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	A scratch?  Your arm's off.
L392018	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	'Tis but a scratch.
L392017	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Now stand aside worthy adversary.
L392016	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	So be it!
L392015	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	I move for no man.
L392014	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
L392013	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	Then you shall die.
L392012	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
L392011	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	None shall pass.
L392010	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What?
L392009	u6666	m445	BLACK KNIGHT	None shall pass.
L392144	u6679	m445	MAN	I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
L392143	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Well, what are you then?
L392142	u6679	m445	MAN	Of course not!  You are English pigs.
L392141	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Well ... can we come up and have a look?
L392140	u6679	m445	MAN	Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +

L392136	u6679	m445	MAN	Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
L392135	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.

L392726	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
L392725	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	We shall attack at once.
L392685	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.

L392684	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What?
L392683	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
L392682	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What?
L392653	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	What does it say?
L392652	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	There!  Look!
L392593	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Just keep me covered.
L392592	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	What with?
L392589	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
L392588	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	They're nervous, sire.
L392487	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	No.  No.  No!

L392476	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	"No.  Ni!  More like this. ""Ni""!"
L392475	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Nu!
L392288	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	"No!  Not the Knights Who Say ""Ni""!"
L392287	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	"Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say ""Ni""!"
L392164	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
L392163	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Who ... Who breaks out?
L392162	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
L392161	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Now what happens?
L392108	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	OF course, my Liege ...
L392107	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
L392106	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
L392104	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
L392103	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Bedevere, my Liege.
L392102	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What is your name?
L392101	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	My liege,  I am honored.
L392100	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
L392099	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	My liege ... forgive me ...
L392098	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
L392097	u6665	m445	BEDEVERE	Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
L392627	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Who did we lose?
L392626	u6689	m445	TIM	Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
L392624	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Charge!
L392623	u6689	m445	TIM	It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
L392622	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Oh, shut up.
L392619	u6689	m445	TIM	I warned you!
L392618	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Je...sus Christ!
L392603	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You got us all worked up.
L392602	u6689	m445	TIM	What?
L392601	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	... You silly sod.
L392600	u6689	m445	TIM	It is the rabbit.
L392599	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Behind the rabbit?
L392598	u6689	m445	TIM	There.
L392597	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Where?
L392596	u6689	m445	TIM	There he is!
L392595	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What?
L392594	u6689	m445	TIM	Too late.
L392585	u6689	m445	TIM	Follow!
L392584	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
L392583	u6689	m445	TIM	... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
L392580	u6689	m445	TIM	Yes, I can help you with your guest.
L392579	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Look, you're a busy man ...
L392572	u6689	m445	TIM	A Grail?
L392571	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	A G...g...g...
L392570	u6689	m445	TIM	What?
L392558	u6689	m445	TIM	Quite.
L392557	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
L392556	u6689	m445	TIM	I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
L392555	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	You know my name?
L392554	u6689	m445	TIM	Greetings King Arthur.
L392553	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
L392552	u6689	m445	TIM	There are some who call me Tim?
L392551	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	By what name are you known?
L392550	u6689	m445	TIM	I am an enchanter.
L392549	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
L392002	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Come on, patsy.
L392001	u6671	m445	DENNIS	Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
L392000	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Bloody peasant! 
L391999	u6671	m445	DENNIS	Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
L391998	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Shut up!
L391997	u6671	m445	DENNIS	Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
L391996	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Shut up, will you. Shut up!
L391995	u6671	m445	DENNIS	I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
L391994	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Shut up!
L391993	u6671	m445	DENNIS	You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
L391985	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
L391984	u6671	m445	DENNIS	... but a two-thirds majority ...
L391983	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Be quiet!
L391982	u6671	m445	DENNIS	... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
L391981	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Yes, I see.
L391980	u6671	m445	DENNIS	... But all the decision of that officer ...
L391979	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Yes.
L391978	u6671	m445	DENNIS	I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
L391962	u6671	m445	DENNIS	Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
L391961	u6664	m445	ARTHUR	Well ... I AM king.
L391960	u6671	m445	DENNIS	What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...

L392438	u6672	m445	FATHER	Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
L392437	u6678	m445	LAUNCELOT	It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
L392435	u6678	m445	LAUNCELOT	Oh ... that's awfully nice.
L392434	u6672	m445	FATHER	Do you want to come and have a drink?

L392458	u6683	m445	PRINCE	Well ... I'll tell you ...
L392457	u6672	m445	FATHER	How?

L392455	u6672	m445	FATHER	You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
L392423	u6672	m445	FATHER	Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
L392422	u6683	m445	PRINCE	Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
L392410	u6672	m445	FATHER	Not you.
L392409	u6683	m445	PRINCE	I'm ... your son ...
L392408	u6672	m445	FATHER	Who are you?
L392377	u6672	m445	FATHER	Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
L392376	u6683	m445	PRINCE	But, Father.
L392330	u6683	m445	PRINCE	I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
L392329	u6672	m445	FATHER	Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
L392328	u6683	m445	PRINCE	But I don't like her.
L392327	u6672	m445	FATHER	Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
L392326	u6683	m445	PRINCE	Herbert.

L392321	u6672	m445	FATHER	Rather what?
L392320	u6683	m445	PRINCE	But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
L392319	u6672	m445	FATHER	Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
L392318	u6683	m445	PRINCE	But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
L392317	u6672	m445	FATHER	Father, lad.
L392316	u6683	m445	PRINCE	But, Mother ...
L392315	u6672	m445	FATHER	No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
L392314	u6683	m445	PRINCE	What - the curtains?
L392313	u6672	m445	FATHER	One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
L392375	u6673	m445	FIRST GUARD	Oh, I see,  Right.
L392374	u6672	m445	FATHER	No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.

L392372	u6672	m445	FATHER	Where are you going?
L392369	u6672	m445	FATHER	Is that clear?
L392368	u6673	m445	FIRST GUARD	Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
L392367	u6672	m445	FATHER	Yes ...  make sure ...
L392366	u6673	m445	FIRST GUARD	The Prince ... ?

L392357	u6672	m445	FATHER	No, not anyone else - just me.
L392356	u6673	m445	FIRST GUARD	Until you, or anyone else ...
L392355	u6672	m445	FATHER	No ... just keep him in here.
L392354	u6673	m445	FIRST GUARD	Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
L392353	u6672	m445	FATHER	No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
L392352	u6673	m445	FIRST GUARD	Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?

L392338	u6673	m445	FIRST GUARD	... and you'll come and get him.
L392337	u6672	m445	FATHER	No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
L392334	u6672	m445	FATHER	No.  Until I come and get him.

L392332	u6672	m445	FATHER	Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
L392220	u6690	m445	ZOOT	You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.

L392217	u6690	m445	ZOOT	I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.

L392268	u6678	m445	LAUNCELOT	It's too perilous.
L392267	u6675	m445	GALAHAD	Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?

L392265	u6675	m445	GALAHAD	I don't think I was.
L392264	u6678	m445	LAUNCELOT	We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
L392258	u6675	m445	GALAHAD	No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
L392257	u6678	m445	LAUNCELOT	Come Sir Galahad, quickly!

L392402	u6683	m445	PRINCE	You got my note!
L392401	u6678	m445	LAUNCELOT	Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
L392545	u6681	m445	OTHER KNIGHTS	You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
L392544	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
L392543	u6681	m445	OTHER KNIGHTS	They're all saying the word ...
L392541	u6681	m445	OTHER KNIGHTS	Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
L392540	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	Stop saying the word!
L392520	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	Don't say that word.
L392519	u6681	m445	OTHER KNIGHTS	Oh!
L392515	u6681	m445	OTHER KNIGHTS	Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
L392514	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
L392513	u6681	m445	OTHER KNIGHTS	A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
L392512	u6688	m445	TALL KNIGHT	When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
L392621	u6689	m445	TIM	Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
L392620	u6684	m445	ROBIN	I done it again.
L392614	u6689	m445	TIM	Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
L392613	u6684	m445	ROBIN	What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
L392612	u6689	m445	TIM	Look.  I'm warning you.
L392611	u6684	m445	ROBIN	|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
L392607	u6689	m445	TIM	That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
L392606	u6684	m445	ROBIN	You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
L392196	u6685	m445	SINGERS	When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
L392195	u6684	m445	ROBIN	No, no, no.
L392194	u6685	m445	SINGERS	Bravely ran away, away.
L392193	u6684	m445	ROBIN	I didn't.
L392192	u6685	m445	SINGERS	Brave Sir Robin ran away.
L392177	u6684	m445	ROBIN	Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
L392176	u6685	m445	SINGERS	He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
L392172	u6684	m445	ROBIN	Shut up.
L392171	u6685	m445	SINGERS	Brave, Sir Rob ...
L392170	u6684	m445	ROBIN	Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
L410762	u6841	m457	3JANE	Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
L410761	u6851	m457	MOLLY	My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
L410760	u6841	m457	3JANE	You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
L410758	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Don't play with me.
L410757	u6841	m457	3JANE	He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
L410756	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Take this off.
L410754	u6841	m457	3JANE	Then we would have talked, you and I.
L410753	u6851	m457	MOLLY	No. I only needed the code from you.
L410752	u6841	m457	3JANE	Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
L410621	u6841	m457	3JANE	Of course.
L410620	u6851	m457	MOLLY	They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
L410619	u6841	m457	3JANE	I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
L410618	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Let me get you another glass of wine.
L410616	u6841	m457	3JANE	I'm fine.
L410615	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
L410796	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Of course...
L410795	u6841	m457	3JANE	What about her?
L410794	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
L410793	u6841	m457	3JANE	You're hurt...
L410742	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
L410741	u6841	m457	3JANE	Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
L410733	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
L410732	u6841	m457	3JANE	She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
L410782	u6845	m457	CASE	No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
L410781	u6842	m457	AEROL	Ghost a steppin' razor...
L410747	u6845	m457	CASE	A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410746	u6842	m457	AEROL	What you lookin' for, mon?
L410728	u6842	m457	AEROL	Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
L410727	u6845	m457	CASE	What the hell is that?
L410717	u6842	m457	AEROL	Straylight. Kitchen dock.
L410716	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
L410672	u6845	m457	CASE	If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
L410671	u6842	m457	AEROL	Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
L410670	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you get us into Straylight?
L410565	u6842	m457	AEROL	The Elders, mon...
L410564	u6845	m457	CASE	What are you doing in here?
L410543	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
L410542	u6851	m457	MOLLY	How's the villa's security?
L410541	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
L410534	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
L410533	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
L410476	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
L410475	u6851	m457	MOLLY	A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
L410234	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
L410233	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's an A.I.
L410229	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
L410228	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Easy...
L410547	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	And how do you suggest I do that?
L410546	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
L410518	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What?
L410517	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
L410516	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
L410510	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
L410509	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
L410508	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
L410502	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Why not?
L410501	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Alright. Let's talk business.
L410607	u6845	m457	CASE	I find out now.
L410606	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
L410600	u6845	m457	CASE	This ain't Bangkok, chief.
L410599	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You've got your orders.
L410597	u6845	m457	CASE	The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
L410596	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What are you talking about?
L410595	u6845	m457	CASE	As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
L410594	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
L410593	u6845	m457	CASE	Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
L410538	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
L410537	u6845	m457	CASE	That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
L410474	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
L410473	u6845	m457	CASE	The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
L410472	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
L410471	u6845	m457	CASE	He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
L410470	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
L410469	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You see the couple up in the balcony?
L410468	u6845	m457	CASE	Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
L410356	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
L410355	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah, well it's working.
L410349	u6845	m457	CASE	Linked?
L410348	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You'll be linked during the entire operation.
L410347	u6845	m457	CASE	That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
L410346	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	"Offworld. The A.I.... this ""Wintermute"" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems."
L410345	u6845	m457	CASE	Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
L410344	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Prepping your trip.
L410343	u6845	m457	CASE	He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
L410342	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What about McCoy?
L410341	u6845	m457	CASE	Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
L410340	u6845	m457	CASE	No, but it traced me.
L410339	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Did you trace it?
L410338	u6845	m457	CASE	Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
L410337	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What's this?
L410333	u6845	m457	CASE	What's he doing to my gear?
L410332	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
L410331	u6845	m457	CASE	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
L410330	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You ran without us.
L410251	u6845	m457	CASE	It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
L410250	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
L410249	u6845	m457	CASE	And then?
L410248	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
L410247	u6845	m457	CASE	Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
L410246	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
L410245	u6845	m457	CASE	What are you talking about?
L410244	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
L410243	u6845	m457	CASE	That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
L410242	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I've arranged for him to work with us.
L410241	u6845	m457	CASE	Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
L410240	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Dixie McCoy
L410239	u6845	m457	CASE	I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
L410238	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	It hasn't yet.
L410237	u6845	m457	CASE	Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
L410236	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
L410235	u6845	m457	CASE	First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
L410232	u6845	m457	CASE	Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
L410231	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
L410230	u6845	m457	CASE	Why'd you do it, Armitage?
L410227	u6845	m457	CASE	You son of a bitch...
L410226	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
L410225	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Good, because you've got a new one.
L410224	u6845	m457	CASE	Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
L410223	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
L410222	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
L410221	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
L410177	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
L410176	u6845	m457	CASE	Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
L410175	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
L410174	u6845	m457	CASE	It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
L410173	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
L410172	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
L410171	u6845	m457	CASE	I'd say you were full of shit.
L410170	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
L410169	u6845	m457	CASE	My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
L410168	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
L410167	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
L410166	u6845	m457	CASE	Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
L410165	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
L410164	u6845	m457	CASE	What does this have to do with me?
L410163	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
L410160	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Very well.
L410159	u6845	m457	CASE	You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
L410158	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
L410712	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
L410711	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
L410710	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
L410709	u6845	m457	CASE	What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
L410708	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
L410707	u6845	m457	CASE	The access code to your mainframe.
L410706	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	The words?
L410705	u6845	m457	CASE	Tell me the words.
L410703	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
L410702	u6845	m457	CASE	Are you even really alive?
L410701	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	"You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote ""Wintermute""."
L410698	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
L410697	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you read my mind?
L410696	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
L410695	u6845	m457	CASE	I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
L410694	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	An odd selection, Mr Case.
L410105	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah.
L410104	u6852	m457	RATZ	Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
L410103	u6845	m457	CASE	You're pleasant tonight.
L410102	u6852	m457	RATZ	Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
L410101	u6852	m457	RATZ	No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
L410100	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't have a girl.
L410099	u6852	m457	RATZ	I saw your girl yesterday.
L410095	u6845	m457	CASE	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
L410094	u6852	m457	RATZ	Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
L410306	u6845	m457	CASE	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
L410305	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
L410304	u6845	m457	CASE	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
L410303	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
L410302	u6845	m457	CASE	That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
L410301	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
L410300	u6845	m457	CASE	As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
L410299	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
L410298	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah. That was me.
L410297	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
L410296	u6845	m457	CASE	Fine, Dixie. Fine.
L410295	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
L410294	u6845	m457	CASE	It's Case. Remember me?
L410293	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Hey, bro.
L410906	u6845	m457	CASE	Maybe so...
L410905	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Jah guides us.
L410904	u6845	m457	CASE	Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
L410902	u6845	m457	CASE	We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
L410901	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
L410900	u6845	m457	CASE	Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
L410895	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
L410894	u6845	m457	CASE	Ready?
L410890	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you walk?
L410889	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Four men. Babylon soldiers.
L410787	u6845	m457	CASE	The girl 3Jane. We need her.
L410786	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
L410766	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	This place empty as a tomb, mon.
L410765	u6845	m457	CASE	We're doing fine. Take the next right.
L410674	u6845	m457	CASE	I an' I, man. I an' I.
L410673	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
L410613	u6845	m457	CASE	Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
L410612	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	All things possible in Babylon.
L410611	u6845	m457	CASE	Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
L410610	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
L410609	u6845	m457	CASE	She's ready to go.
L410572	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
L410571	u6845	m457	CASE	What elders?
L410858	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
L410857	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the route to the core?
L410848	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
L410847	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
L410846	u6846	m457	DIXIE	This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
L410845	u6845	m457	CASE	I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
L410844	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You haven't got it?
L410843	u6845	m457	CASE	It's coming.
L410842	u6846	m457	DIXIE	One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
L410841	u6845	m457	CASE	How's the ice?
L410840	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You're late.
L410779	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
L410778	u6845	m457	CASE	Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
L410777	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
L410776	u6845	m457	CASE	Less than thirty minutes.
L410775	u6846	m457	DIXIE	How much time you got left?
L410774	u6845	m457	CASE	Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
L410773	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
L410772	u6845	m457	CASE	How long, Dixie?
L410771	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
L410770	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
L410769	u6845	m457	CASE	How's the ice break?
L410768	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yo.
L410685	u6845	m457	CASE	Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
L410684	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It'll flatline your ass.
L410682	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
L410681	u6846	m457	DIXIE	What are you talkin' about?
L410680	u6845	m457	CASE	You can make your move when it comes after me.
L410679	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
L410678	u6845	m457	CASE	We run. You crack the pattern?
L410677	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
L410676	u6845	m457	CASE	We got problems topside.
L410675	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Where the hell have you been?
L410562	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
L410561	u6845	m457	CASE	The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
L410560	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
L410559	u6845	m457	CASE	No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
L410558	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
L410557	u6845	m457	CASE	So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
L410556	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
L410555	u6845	m457	CASE	Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
L410554	u6846	m457	DIXIE	He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
L410553	u6846	m457	DIXIE	That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
L410552	u6845	m457	CASE	Bright enough to be dangerous.
L410551	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
L410550	u6845	m457	CASE	It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
L410431	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
L410430	u6845	m457	CASE	I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
L410429	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
L410428	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
L410427	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you take me to it?
L410426	u6846	m457	DIXIE	That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
L410425	u6845	m457	CASE	How are we doing?
L410424	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yo.
L410383	u6846	m457	DIXIE	When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
L410382	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410381	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
L410380	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
L410379	u6846	m457	DIXIE	No problem, amigo.
L410378	u6845	m457	CASE	I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
L410377	u6845	m457	CASE	Nobody has.
L410376	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Never heard of him.
L410375	u6845	m457	CASE	A guy who calls himself Armitage.
L410374	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Who got you into this?
L410373	u6845	m457	CASE	I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
L410372	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
L410316	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410315	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
L410314	u6845	m457	CASE	You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
L410313	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
L410312	u6845	m457	CASE	Right...
L410311	u6846	m457	DIXIE	What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
L410810	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	No!... No...
L410809	u6845	m457	CASE	Want to fucking answer them?
L410807	u6845	m457	CASE	The angels... I think they're calling your name.
L410806	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What?
L410805	u6845	m457	CASE	Wait... You hear that?
L410545	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
L410544	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the mainframe's access code?
L410498	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
L410497	u6845	m457	CASE	Case.
L410496	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
L410877	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't know. I don't know...
L410876	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Case... are you okay?
L410114	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
L410113	u6845	m457	CASE	Where did you here that?
L410112	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
L410111	u6845	m457	CASE	I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
L410110	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
L410109	u6845	m457	CASE	Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
L410108	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
L410107	u6845	m457	CASE	I thought you already left.
L410106	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Hello, Case.
L410455	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
L410454	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
L410452	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
L410451	u6845	m457	CASE	I think you're full of shit.
L410450	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
L410449	u6845	m457	CASE	Why would you want me to kill you?
L410448	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	"I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My ""ice"" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible."
L410447	u6845	m457	CASE	Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
L410446	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
L410445	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
L410444	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
L410443	u6845	m457	CASE	And Linda...
L410442	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I had to limit your options.
L410441	u6845	m457	CASE	You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
L410440	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	And we really do have to talk.
L410439	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
L410438	u6845	m457	CASE	I know who you are.
L410831	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Hold on.
L410830	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm still going in.
L410829	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You're out of time, man.
L410828	u6845	m457	CASE	Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
L410827	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it?
L410826	u6845	m457	CASE	Shit...
L410821	u6845	m457	CASE	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
L410820	u6851	m457	MOLLY	My God... these people are insane.
L410818	u6845	m457	CASE	No we don't...
L410817	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We've still got to find the mainframe.
L410816	u6845	m457	CASE	Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410815	u6851	m457	MOLLY	...And if I guess wrong?
L410814	u6845	m457	CASE	The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
L410812	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
L410811	u6845	m457	CASE	Is he going to make it?
L410530	u6845	m457	CASE	No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
L410529	u6851	m457	MOLLY	When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
L410528	u6845	m457	CASE	I know you have. C'mere.
L410527	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
L410525	u6845	m457	CASE	What went down between you and Riviera?
L410524	u6851	m457	MOLLY	I know.
L410483	u6851	m457	MOLLY	For Peter, that's a short trip.
L410482	u6845	m457	CASE	That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
L410481	u6851	m457	MOLLY	He projects with neural implants.
L410466	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.

L410459	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll be okay.
L410458	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
L410457	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
L410456	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Case... Are you alright?
L410418	u6845	m457	CASE	Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
L410417	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's wrong? Don't like flying?
L410410	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Give me five minutes.

L410395	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Case...
L410394	u6845	m457	CASE	...Feels like you.
L410393	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Put the gun down, Case.
L410392	u6845	m457	CASE	It sounds like you.
L410391	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
L410390	u6845	m457	CASE	Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
L410325	u6845	m457	CASE	...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
L410324	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You okay?
L410273	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
L410272	u6845	m457	CASE	The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
L410271	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Dixie McCoy didn't.
L410270	u6845	m457	CASE	Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
L410269	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Won't that mean you're dead?
L410268	u6845	m457	CASE	The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
L410266	u6845	m457	CASE	Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
L410265	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Too late?
L410264	u6845	m457	CASE	Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
L410263	u6851	m457	MOLLY	A regular Fagan.
L410262	u6845	m457	CASE	When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
L410261	u6851	m457	MOLLY	So you're a wire junkie.
L410260	u6845	m457	CASE	On a good run... yeah.
L410259	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.

L410216	u6845	m457	CASE	What the fuck... are you serious?
L410215	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
L410214	u6845	m457	CASE	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
L410213	u6851	m457	MOLLY	That's not going to help.

L410141	u6851	m457	MOLLY	His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.

L410850	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What the fuck kind of questions are those?
L410835	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What are you talking about?
L410834	u6851	m457	MOLLY	How are you at riddles, Peter?
L410833	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What?
L410832	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Get up.
L410739	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
L410738	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Like what?
L410737	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
L410736	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Who?
L410735	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
L410734	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Peter... What do you think you're doing?
L443797	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
L443796	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Seal the cave?
L443713	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No sir, I haven't forgotten.
L443712	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
L443711	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
L443702	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
L443701	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	I apologize.
L443700	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
L443699	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
L443678	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
L443677	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
L443676	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
L443674	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
L443673	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	How did you know we'd come here?
L443520	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
L443519	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
L443377	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
L443376	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
L443375	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
L443374	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
L443373	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Dr. Zaius --
L443319	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
L443318	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
L443774	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Good luck then.
L443773	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
L443751	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
L443750	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
L443718	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
L443717	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	What are you doing there?
L443716	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
L443685	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
L443684	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Taylor, I'd rather you -
L443670	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Shut up.
L443669	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
L443668	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
L443662	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Right now, if you like.
L443661	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
L443651	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
L443650	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
L443647	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
L443646	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Where does the river lead?
L443625	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
L443624	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
L443623	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
L443622	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
L443621	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You still don't believe me, do you?
L443620	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
L443617	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
L443616	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	As you wish.
L443613	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Just the same, I want one.
L443612	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	The best. But we won't need them.
L443611	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Do you have any weapons?
L443610	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
L443631	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
L443630	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
L443607	u7074	m473	ZIRA	There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
L443606	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	How did it go?
L443390	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira....
L443389	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
L443372	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
L443371	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
L443370	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
L443369	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Well, maybe they're not.
L443368	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
L443367	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'I am not a missing link.'
L443365	u7074	m473	ZIRA	How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
L443364	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
L443363	u7074	m473	ZIRA	You didn't think so then.
L443362	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	The evidence was very meager --
L443361	u7074	m473	ZIRA	-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
L443360	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's probably wrong --
L443359	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
L443358	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No, they won't -
L443357	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
L443356	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
L443355	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
L443354	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	I don't. And I'm not going to try.
L443353	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'Then how do you account for me?,
L443352	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
L443351	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
L443345	u7074	m473	ZIRA	And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
L443344	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Flight is a scientific impossibility.
L443342	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	And they fell out of the sky with you?
L443341	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
L443340	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
L443339	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Now, just a minute --
L443335	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Where did you learn to do this?
L443334	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
L443333	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
L443308	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
L443307	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The blood transfusion.
L443306	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Remembers what?
L443305	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Look -- she remembers.
L443304	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
L443303	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	What's so special about him?
L443302	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
L443301	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Neither do I.
L443300	u7074	m473	ZIRA	No.
L443299	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Do you have to work tonight?
L443218	u7064	m473	DODGE	Blessed are the vegetarians.
L443217	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
L443191	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Let's find them all.
L443190	u7064	m473	DODGE	Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
L443172	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
L443171	u7064	m473	DODGE	Taylor -- quit riding him.
L443162	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	None at all.
L443161	u7064	m473	DODGE	Any particular reason?
L443160	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That way.
L443159	u7064	m473	DODGE	Which direction?
L443158	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
L443157	u7064	m473	DODGE	No.
L443156	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Any sign of dangerous ionization?
L443155	u7064	m473	DODGE	Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
L443142	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
L443141	u7064	m473	DODGE	But how long is a day?
L443140	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
L443139	u7064	m473	DODGE	Yo!
L443138	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Geiger counter?
L443137	u7064	m473	DODGE	Yo!
L443136	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Got your sensors?
L443245	u7065	m473	GALEN	They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
L443244	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
L443243	u7065	m473	GALEN	Hmph.
L443242	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
L443241	u7065	m473	GALEN	You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
L443240	u7074	m473	ZIRA	What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
L443239	u7065	m473	GALEN	But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
L443234	u7065	m473	GALEN	These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
L443233	u7074	m473	ZIRA	This place is dirty, doctor.
L443230	u7065	m473	GALEN	I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
L443229	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Will he live?
L443228	u7065	m473	GALEN	Him.
L443227	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
L443539	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
L443538	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
L443528	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.
L443527	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection!
L443522	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
L443521	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
L443499	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
L443498	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
L443473	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
L443472	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
L443468	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
L443467	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
L443466	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
L443464	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
L443463	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
L443448	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
L443447	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
L443479	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Show this to the President.
L443478	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
L443477	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
L443476	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
L443475	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
L443474	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
L443331	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Do as I say.
L443330	u7067	m473	JULIUS	He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
L443329	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
L443324	u7067	m473	JULIUS	I'll see.
L443323	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
L443322	u7067	m473	JULIUS	What happened?
L443266	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
L443265	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He's trying to form words.
L443264	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Huh?
L443263	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Did you see that? It's remarkable!
L443261	u7067	m473	JULIUS	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
L443260	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
L443256	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
L443255	u7067	m473	JULIUS	You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
L443252	u7067	m473	JULIUS	No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
L443251	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
L443250	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Good morning, Dr. Zira.
L443220	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
L443219	u7068	m473	LANDON	We got off at the wrong stop.
L443209	u7068	m473	LANDON	Try telling them our names.
L443208	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No cigar.
L443201	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay.
L443200	u7068	m473	LANDON	Can we take a dip?
L443197	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Let's take a look.
L443196	u7068	m473	LANDON	Scarecrows?
L443186	u7068	m473	LANDON	I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
L443185	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	But I'm not prepared to die.
L443184	u7068	m473	LANDON	Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
L443183	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Don't bother
L443182	u7068	m473	LANDON	Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
L443181	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
L443179	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
L443178	u7068	m473	LANDON	Climb off me, will you!
L443177	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
L443175	u7068	m473	LANDON	I'm prepared to die.
L443174	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
L443173	u7068	m473	LANDON	All right --
L443170	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
L443169	u7068	m473	LANDON	If only we could get a fix.
L443154	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
L443153	u7068	m473	LANDON	Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
L443152	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
L443151	u7068	m473	LANDON	long pause) You know it.
L443150	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
L443149	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	By our time.  You've turned gray.
L443148	u7068	m473	LANDON	Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
L443147	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
L443146	u7068	m473	LANDON	You don't seem very cut up about it.
L443145	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Air leak. Died in her sleep.
L443144	u7068	m473	LANDON	Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
L443143	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Landon! Join the expedition.
L443130	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
L443129	u7068	m473	LANDON	Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
L443128	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're here to stay.
L443127	u7068	m473	LANDON	Gone.
L443123	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Forget it. Abandon ship.
L443122	u7068	m473	LANDON	It's no use ... there she goes.
L443118	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	To Earth! That we've landed!
L443117	u7068	m473	LANDON	What signal?
L443116	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Landon! Send a last signal.
L443783	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
L443782	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	What?
L443781	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
L443780	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	I think you're making a mistake.
L443779	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Lucius.
L443762	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
L443761	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
L443738	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Yes, I can do that.
L443737	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
L443736	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	What is it?
L443735	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
L443734	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
L443733	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
L443694	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Relax. You'll see it all later.
L443693	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
L443692	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
L443659	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
L443658	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
L443653	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm for that.
L443652	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Shouldn't we be moving on?
L443585	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Fine. Just let her out.
L443584	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
L443583	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I want her.
L443582	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Zira doesn't want your female.
L443581	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	She comes along too.
L443579	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Come on. Get me out of here.
L443578	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
L443577	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Who are you?
L443640	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	To scare off humans?
L443639	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The Hunt Club.
L443638	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Who put them up?
L443592	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
L443591	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Gorilla hunters ...
L443588	u7074	m473	ZIRA	All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
L443587	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	He wouldn't leave her.
L443586	u7074	m473	ZIRA	I told you not to bring the other one.
L443446	u7074	m473	ZIRA	At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
L443445	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
L443444	u7074	m473	ZIRA	My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
L443443	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
L443383	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We're -- conducting a new experiment.
L443382	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	Why special?
L443381	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
L443380	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
L443379	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A man, Dr. Maximus.
L443378	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	What is that?
L443514	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
L443513	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
L443494	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
L443493	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	One is in a museum!
L443462	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
L443461	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
L443460	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
L443459	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My name is Taylor.
L443458	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
L443532	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
L443531	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.
L443526	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
L443525	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	How so?
L443485	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
L443484	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	This is a joke in very poor taste.
L443483	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
L443482	u7074	m473	ZIRA	"'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."""
L443481	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Read it yourself.
L443480	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
L443471	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
L443470	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Mind your tongue, madame.
L443469	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That?s a lie!
L443454	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
L443453	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
L443442	u7074	m473	ZIRA	By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
L443441	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
L443790	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
L443789	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
L443788	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
L443787	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
L443786	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
L443785	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
L443769	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
L443768	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
L443766	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
L443765	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then there is another jungle?
L443753	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
L443752	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
L443729	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Cease fire! Withdraw!
L443728	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Tell him to pull back!
L443723	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
L443722	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
L443691	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay.Up to the cave.
L443690	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course.
L443689	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
L443688	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Twelve hundred years ago.
L443687	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
L443686	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	What is your proposal?
L443683	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
L443682	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
L443667	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
L443666	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Stop right there.
L443566	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
L443565	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
L443564	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
L443563	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I don't know.
L443562	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
L443561	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
L443560	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
L443559	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then you admit --
L443558	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
L443557	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
L443556	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course.
L443555	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
L443553	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
L443552	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
L443551	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What about it?
L443550	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
L443549	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
L443548	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You lied. Where is your tribe?
L443547	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
L443546	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
L443545	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
L443544	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No.
L443543	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
L443542	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What about me?
L443505	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Identify him, then. Speak to him.
L443504	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	With one of them.
L443503	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
L443778	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	God bless you.
L443777	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
L443776	u7074	m473	ZIRA	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
L443775	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
L443772	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's better than going to prison for heresy.
L443771	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We can't.
L443770	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Would you like to come along?
L443749	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
L443748	u7074	m473	ZIRA	It's humiliating.
L443747	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Why not?
L443746	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
L443742	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, you can't.
L443741	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
L443710	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
L443709	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor! Tell him.
L443681	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
L443680	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, please --
L443679	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
L443655	u7074	m473	ZIRA	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
L443654	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
L443637	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
L443636	u7074	m473	ZIRA	You want her that much?
L443635	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Maybe not.
L443634	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
L443633	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Yes.
L443632	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Are you going to take her with you?
L443619	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
L443618	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
L443590	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
L443589	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Listen-
L443510	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
L443509	u7074	m473	ZIRA	No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
L443508	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You! ... You knew about this?
L443502	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Second from the left.
L443501	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Which one?
L443500	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's him...Landon.
L443436	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A hearing.
L443435	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What is this?
L443434	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Shhhh!
L443433	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
L443281	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
L443280	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
L443278	u7074	m473	ZIRA	There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
L443277	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
L443259	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Listen, listen -- I can speak --
L443258	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
L443799	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
L443798	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But the proof? The doll?
L443764	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
L443763	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
L443706	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	What?
L443705	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But there's the doll, sir.
L443704	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
L443524	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
L443523	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
L443497	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
L443496	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He doesn't know.
L443495	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
L443492	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Where are they now?
L443491	u7074	m473	ZIRA	This is his assertion.
L443490	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
L443489	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Like you, I find it difficult.
L443488	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Do you believe him?
L443487	u7074	m473	ZIRA	I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
L443486	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
L443385	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Yes, Sir.
L443384	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
L443288	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But perhaps he understood --
L443287	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course. He saw you moving yours.
L443286	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He's moving his fingers!
L449774	u7123	m477	UTAH	I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
L449773	u7118	m477	BODHI	You never were...
L449772	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm not FBI anymore.
L449771	u7118	m477	BODHI	And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
L449758	u7123	m477	UTAH	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
L449757	u7118	m477	BODHI	Wild ride, huh?
L449756	u7123	m477	UTAH	SHIT!!
L449755	u7118	m477	BODHI	Three seconds... two... one...
L449753	u7118	m477	BODHI	Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
L449752	u7123	m477	UTAH	Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
L449751	u7118	m477	BODHI	Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
L449750	u7118	m477	BODHI	Naw, you pull it!
L449749	u7123	m477	UTAH	No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
L449748	u7118	m477	BODHI	Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
L449741	u7123	m477	UTAH	What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
L449740	u7118	m477	BODHI	Why should I?
L449713	u7123	m477	UTAH	The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
L449712	u7118	m477	BODHI	I say when it's over!
L449711	u7123	m477	UTAH	Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
L449710	u7118	m477	BODHI	And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
L449709	u7123	m477	UTAH	You gotta tell me where she is.
L449708	u7118	m477	BODHI	Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
L449707	u7123	m477	UTAH	Where's Roach?
L449706	u7123	m477	UTAH	Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
L449705	u7118	m477	BODHI	But you're not alone.
L449704	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm not armed.
L449665	u7118	m477	BODHI	Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
L449664	u7123	m477	UTAH	Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
L449663	u7118	m477	BODHI	Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
L449662	u7123	m477	UTAH	I can't do this.
L449654	u7118	m477	BODHI	See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
L449653	u7123	m477	UTAH	We're wasting time.
L449651	u7118	m477	BODHI	Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
L449650	u7123	m477	UTAH	You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
L449649	u7118	m477	BODHI	She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
L449648	u7123	m477	UTAH	Talk.
L449647	u7118	m477	BODHI	Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
L449646	u7123	m477	UTAH	You're a fucking dead man--
L449644	u7118	m477	BODHI	Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
L449643	u7123	m477	UTAH	What's this?
L449639	u7118	m477	BODHI	Okay!
L449638	u7123	m477	UTAH	You first!
L449637	u7118	m477	BODHI	One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
L449636	u7123	m477	UTAH	You do it... you first!
L449635	u7118	m477	BODHI	Don't screw around man, pull it!
L449634	u7123	m477	UTAH	After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
L449633	u7118	m477	BODHI	You gonna pull?
L449624	u7118	m477	BODHI	I'll take that as a yes.
L449623	u7123	m477	UTAH	Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
L449622	u7118	m477	BODHI	Utah, you copy bruddah?
L449621	u7118	m477	BODHI	My man!
L449620	u7123	m477	UTAH	We gonna jump or jerk off?
L449617	u7118	m477	BODHI	Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
L449616	u7123	m477	UTAH	You gotta earn trust.
L449615	u7118	m477	BODHI	I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
L449614	u7123	m477	UTAH	So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
L449613	u7118	m477	BODHI	It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
L449611	u7118	m477	BODHI	Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
L449610	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
L449609	u7118	m477	BODHI	Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
L449608	u7123	m477	UTAH	Once.
L449607	u7118	m477	BODHI	Ever done this before?
L449603	u7118	m477	BODHI	'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
L449602	u7123	m477	UTAH	One shot stopping.
L449597	u7118	m477	BODHI	News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
L449596	u7123	m477	UTAH	How you figure?
L449441	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
L449440	u7118	m477	BODHI	The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
L449439	u7123	m477	UTAH	A flaw I'm working on.
L449438	u7118	m477	BODHI	I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
L449437	u7123	m477	UTAH	I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
L449436	u7118	m477	BODHI	Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
L449435	u7118	m477	BODHI	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
L449434	u7123	m477	UTAH	I gotta be fucking crazy.
L449412	u7118	m477	BODHI	No, Bells Beach, Australia.
L449411	u7123	m477	UTAH	So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
L449396	u7118	m477	BODHI	Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
L449395	u7123	m477	UTAH	Don't you gamble?
L449378	u7118	m477	BODHI	Come with Tyler.  She knows.
L449377	u7123	m477	UTAH	Where?
L449376	u7123	m477	UTAH	Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
L449375	u7118	m477	BODHI	De nada.
L449374	u7123	m477	UTAH	Thanks for stepping in.
L449373	u7118	m477	BODHI	No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
L449372	u7123	m477	UTAH	You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
L449371	u7118	m477	BODHI	They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
L449370	u7123	m477	UTAH	What's their program?
L449369	u7118	m477	BODHI	The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
L449368	u7123	m477	UTAH	Friends of yours, huh?
L449305	u7123	m477	UTAH	Not yet.
L449304	u7118	m477	BODHI	Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
L449303	u7123	m477	UTAH	Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
L449302	u7118	m477	BODHI	And that's why you never went pro?
L449301	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
L449300	u7118	m477	BODHI	Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
L449478	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	There's nobody else here...
L449477	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
L449476	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
L449475	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
L449468	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	No.
L449467	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
L449466	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	Yeah?  What?
L449695	u7123	m477	UTAH	Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
L449694	u7120	m477	HARP	Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
L449318	u7123	m477	UTAH	Caught my first tube this morning.
L449317	u7120	m477	HARP	Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
L449315	u7123	m477	UTAH	The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
L449314	u7120	m477	HARP	What?
L449313	u7123	m477	UTAH	Babes.
L449312	u7120	m477	HARP	A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
L449311	u7123	m477	UTAH	A little mushy.
L449310	u7120	m477	HARP	Surf conditions okay?
L449309	u7123	m477	UTAH	Fine.
L449308	u7120	m477	HARP	How was the beach?
L449150	u7123	m477	UTAH	Not so far.
L449149	u7120	m477	HARP	You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
L449147	u7123	m477	UTAH	Zero distortion, sir.
L449146	u7120	m477	HARP	That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
L449145	u7123	m477	UTAH	1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
L449144	u7120	m477	HARP	This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
L449143	u7123	m477	UTAH	I take the skin off chicken.
L449142	u7120	m477	HARP	All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
L449141	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sir?
L449140	u7120	m477	HARP	Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
L449139	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yes, sir.
L449138	u7120	m477	HARP	You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
L449699	u7120	m477	HARP	What that?
L449698	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
L449697	u7120	m477	HARP	Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
L449696	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
L449194	u7120	m477	HARP	Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
L449193	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
L449192	u7120	m477	HARP	That's the point, isn't it?
L449191	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
L449190	u7120	m477	HARP	Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
L449189	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
L449188	u7120	m477	HARP	They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
L449721	u7123	m477	UTAH	NOOO!!
L449720	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Kid, get outta the way!!
L449719	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo!  Don't fire!
L449702	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Figured you did.
L449701	u7123	m477	UTAH	I know where they're going.
L449561	u7123	m477	UTAH	Nothing.
L449560	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Nothing?
L449547	u7123	m477	UTAH	You sure?!
L449546	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	They took a left at the next light!
L449545	u7123	m477	UTAH	The hell are they?!
L449536	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
L449535	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
L449534	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Time for lunch.
L449533	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
L449532	u7123	m477	UTAH	I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
L449531	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
L449530	u7123	m477	UTAH	I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
L449528	u7123	m477	UTAH	No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
L449527	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	They're on their way to Maui.
L449523	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
L449522	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
L449521	u7123	m477	UTAH	Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
L449520	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah, or cashing a check.
L449519	u7123	m477	UTAH	Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
L449518	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Did he rob it?
L449517	u7123	m477	UTAH	Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
L449516	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	This Zen master surfer.
L449515	u7123	m477	UTAH	... so I started tailing him.
L449512	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, we gotta talk.
L449511	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
L449498	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Nice tattoo, Dietz.
L449497	u7123	m477	UTAH	Aw shit.
L449464	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
L449463	u7123	m477	UTAH	Got it.
L449462	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
L449461	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
L449459	u7123	m477	UTAH	Right here, partner.
L449458	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
L449391	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
L449390	u7123	m477	UTAH	When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
L449385	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
L449384	u7123	m477	UTAH	... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
L449382	u7123	m477	UTAH	Okay, Dad.
L449381	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
L449367	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Thanks, buddy.
L449366	u7123	m477	UTAH	No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
L449345	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
L449344	u7123	m477	UTAH	Big zippo so far.  How about you?
L449329	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
L449328	u7123	m477	UTAH	The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
L449327	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
L449326	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
L449321	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
L449320	u7123	m477	UTAH	It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
L449319	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
L449235	u7123	m477	UTAH	Got it...
L449234	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	I think you gotta hit them straight on!
L449233	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
L449232	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
L449231	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
L449229	u7123	m477	UTAH	Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
L449228	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Johnny, it's the only way.
L449221	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
L449220	u7123	m477	UTAH	... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
L449218	u7123	m477	UTAH	Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
L449217	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
L449216	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
L449215	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
L449214	u7123	m477	UTAH	Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
L449213	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
L449212	u7123	m477	UTAH	Oh well he must be a surfer.
L449210	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	The fucking punks are surfers.
L449209	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah.  What's your theory?
L449208	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
L449207	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sorry.
L449206	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
L449205	u7123	m477	UTAH	So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
L449204	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
L449203	u7123	m477	UTAH	Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
L449202	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
L449182	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
L449181	u7123	m477	UTAH	Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
L449180	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
L449179	u7123	m477	UTAH	Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
L449178	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
L449177	u7123	m477	UTAH	They don't go for the vault?
L449176	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
L449175	u7123	m477	UTAH	Good move.
L449164	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Welcome to Sea World, kid.
L449163	u7123	m477	UTAH	Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
L449162	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
L449159	u7123	m477	UTAH	The shit they pull, huh?
L449158	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
L449583	u7122	m477	TYLER	Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
L449582	u7123	m477	UTAH	I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
L449580	u7122	m477	TYLER	You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
L449579	u7123	m477	UTAH	Tyler, put the gun down.
L449578	u7122	m477	TYLER	Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
L449572	u7122	m477	TYLER	But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
L449571	u7123	m477	UTAH	Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
L449570	u7122	m477	TYLER	So what'd the other guy look like?
L449569	u7123	m477	UTAH	You're kneeling on my hand.
L449568	u7122	m477	TYLER	Betadyne doesn't hurt.
L449567	u7123	m477	UTAH	Ouch.
L449508	u7123	m477	UTAH	No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
L449507	u7122	m477	TYLER	Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
L449506	u7123	m477	UTAH	I... I gotta go.
L449454	u7123	m477	UTAH	Warm them up.
L449453	u7122	m477	TYLER	Those are cold.
L449451	u7122	m477	TYLER	You don't have to.
L449450	u7123	m477	UTAH	I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
L449449	u7122	m477	TYLER	Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
L449448	u7123	m477	UTAH	What?
L449447	u7122	m477	TYLER	Look at you.
L449446	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
L449445	u7122	m477	TYLER	You had enough?
L449433	u7122	m477	TYLER	Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
L449432	u7123	m477	UTAH	I can barely do this in broad daylight.
L449429	u7122	m477	TYLER	Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
L449428	u7123	m477	UTAH	What's goin' on?
L449424	u7122	m477	TYLER	I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
L449423	u7123	m477	UTAH	What are you talking about?
L449422	u7122	m477	TYLER	Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
L449404	u7122	m477	TYLER	Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
L449403	u7123	m477	UTAH	"Sure, he's ""the Bodhisattva""."
L449402	u7122	m477	TYLER	We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
L449401	u7123	m477	UTAH	Meaning you were expendable.
L449400	u7122	m477	TYLER	People are expendable to Bodhi.
L449399	u7123	m477	UTAH	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
L449398	u7122	m477	TYLER	Catch of the day.
L449397	u7123	m477	UTAH	Who's the girl?
L449393	u7122	m477	TYLER	He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
L449392	u7123	m477	UTAH	Nice place.
L449285	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sure.
L449284	u7122	m477	TYLER	Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
L449282	u7122	m477	TYLER	Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
L449281	u7123	m477	UTAH	I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
L449280	u7123	m477	UTAH	Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
L449279	u7122	m477	TYLER	This gonna take long?
L449278	u7123	m477	UTAH	No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
L449277	u7122	m477	TYLER	What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
L449276	u7123	m477	UTAH	Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
L449275	u7122	m477	TYLER	I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
L449274	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm serious.
L449273	u7122	m477	TYLER	Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
L449272	u7123	m477	UTAH	I need you to teach me.
L449271	u7122	m477	TYLER	I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
L449270	u7123	m477	UTAH	Shrimp and fries.
L449269	u7122	m477	TYLER	What do you want?
L449257	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
L449256	u7123	m477	UTAH	Bye.
L449255	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
L449254	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Who cares!
L449253	u7123	m477	UTAH	My name's Johnny Utah!
L449252	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
L449251	u7123	m477	UTAH	Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
L449250	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
L449249	u7123	m477	UTAH	Well, I saw you and--
L450227	u7125	m478	BILLY	Something... in the trees...
L450226	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
L450150	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What about the rest of Hopper's men?
L450149	u7125	m478	BILLY	I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
L450148	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
L450147	u7125	m478	BILLY	Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
L450132	u7125	m478	BILLY	Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
L450131	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What do you mean?
L450130	u7125	m478	BILLY	Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
L450344	u7126	m478	DILLON	Right behind you.
L450343	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I'll see you there.
L450340	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You know you can't win this one.
L450339	u7126	m478	DILLON	Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
L450338	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	This isn't your style, Dillon.
L450337	u7126	m478	DILLON	No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
L450329	u7126	m478	DILLON	Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
L450328	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
L450323	u7126	m478	DILLON	That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
L450322	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	We're not going.
L450321	u7126	m478	DILLON	What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
L450320	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	We're going to need everyone.
L450319	u7126	m478	DILLON	What the hell do you think you're doing?
L450311	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	No more games.
L450310	u7126	m478	DILLON	You're wastin' your time.
L450276	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
L450275	u7126	m478	DILLON	I can accept that, it comes with the job.
L450274	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
L450273	u7126	m478	DILLON	We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
L450255	u7126	m478	DILLON	The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
L450254	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
L450198	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
L450197	u7126	m478	DILLON	She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
L450184	u7126	m478	DILLON	We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
L450183	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What story did you give to Davis?
L450182	u7126	m478	DILLON	Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
L450181	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Why us?
L450180	u7126	m478	DILLON	That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
L450179	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
L450143	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Well somebody sent them.
L450142	u7126	m478	DILLON	Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
L450141	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
L450134	u7126	m478	DILLON	Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
L450133	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Mean anything to you?
L450129	u7126	m478	DILLON	They're getting better equipped every day.
L450128	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
L450120	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
L450119	u7126	m478	DILLON	You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
L450113	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	This gets better by the minute.
L450112	u7126	m478	DILLON	No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
L450111	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Who's our back-up on this?
L450110	u7126	m478	DILLON	Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
L450098	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Go on.
L450097	u7126	m478	DILLON	Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
L450096	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
L450095	u7126	m478	DILLON	Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
L450094	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Like the old days, Dillon.
L450093	u7126	m478	DILLON	That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
L450092	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You never did know when to quit.
L450091	u7126	m478	DILLON	No way, old buddy.
L450090	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
L450356	u7126	m478	DILLON	We both got scores to settle.
L450355	u7127	m478	MAC	... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
L450354	u7126	m478	DILLON	Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
L450281	u7127	m478	MAC	Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
L450280	u7126	m478	DILLON	What, Sergeant?
L450279	u7127	m478	MAC	Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
L450212	u7127	m478	MAC	Anytime.
L450211	u7126	m478	DILLON	Thanks.
L450268	u7127	m478	MAC	The best friend I ever had.
L450267	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
L450266	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Thank you, Sergeant.
L450265	u7127	m478	MAC	We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
L450264	u7127	m478	MAC	I'll take him.
L450263	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
L450253	u7127	m478	MAC	I saw it.
L450252	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	You saw what?
L450224	u7127	m478	MAC	Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
L450223	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What's got Billy so spooked?
L450167	u7127	m478	MAC	We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
L450166	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Any sign of the hostages?
L450084	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	Someone else will be going in with you.
L450083	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What's that, General?
L450082	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
L450080	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
L450079	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What have you got in mind, General.
L450078	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
L450077	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	That's over the border, General.
L450074	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	It's been a long time, General.
L450073	u7128	m478	PHILIPS	You're looking well, Dutch.
L450305	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
L450304	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	He knows our defenses.
L450303	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
L450241	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	There's no sign of it.
L450240	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Where the hell is his body?
L450239	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	I think it's Hawkins.
L450238	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What in God's name...?
L450237	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	I can't tell.
L450236	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Hawkins?
L450235	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	Major, you'd better take a look at this.
L450137	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
L450136	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	What's he got?
L450125	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
L450124	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Mmmnnn...?
L450123	u7129	m478	RAMIREZ	There's something else, Major...
L450122	u7130	m478	SCHAEFER	Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
L451722	u7143	m480	ALBINO	You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
L451721	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	You don't believe me?
L451719	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	So it's to be torture.
L451718	u7143	m480	ALBINO	The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
L451717	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then why bother curing me?
L451716	u7143	m480	ALBINO	Till they kill you. Yeah.
L451715	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then I'm here till I die?
L451714	u7143	m480	ALBINO	Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
L451993	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
L451992	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I killed him myself.
L451969	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I do not marry tonight.
L451968	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Brides often are, I'm told.
L451967	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Should I be?
L451966	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
L451824	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
L451823	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
L451822	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
L451821	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	You're a silly girl.
L451820	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
L451818	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
L451817	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Every ship but the four you sent.
L451816	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
L451815	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
L451770	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Of course.
L451769	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	He will come for me.
L451749	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
L451748	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	My Westley will always come for me.
L451703	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I swear it will be done.
L451702	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"He is a sailor on the pirate ship ""Revenge."" Promise to return him to his ship."
L451701	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
L451700	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
L451645	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
L451644	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	... as ... you ... wish...
L451642	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
L451641	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
L451640	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	And what am I?
L451639	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	"I asked him what was so important for him. ""True love,"" he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are."
L451638	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	"He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, ""Please. Please, I need to live."" It was the ""please"" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53."
L451637	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Nothing you can say will upset me.
L451636	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Does it bother you to hear?
L451635	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
L451634	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You mock my pain!
L451633	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
L451632	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
L451628	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
L451627	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
L451626	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	With pride. What can I do for you?
L451625	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
L451624	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
L451623	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Rest, Highness.
L451619	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
L451618	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Are not capable of love is what you mean.
L451617	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	He knows I do not love him.
L451616	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
L451615	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
L451614	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
L451613	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
L451612	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
L451611	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
L451610	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Catch your breath.
L451607	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
L451606	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
L451605	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
L451604	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Who are you?
L452050	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
L452049	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
L452048	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"Did you say, ""I do""?"
L452047	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"But it did. I was there. This old man said, ""Man and wife."""
L452046	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
L452045	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	What?
L452044	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It never happened.
L452043	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
L452042	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	What hideous sin have you committed lately?
L452041	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
L452023	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Gently!!
L452022	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"At a time like this that's all you can think to say? ""Gently?"""
L452021	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Gently.
L452020	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
L451687	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
L451686	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We did it.
L451683	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
L451682	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
L451681	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
L451680	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	No. No. We have already succeeded.
L451679	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
L451674	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	What? -- go on --
L451673	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, ""All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" Three years he said that. ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened."
L451671	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
L451670	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
L451669	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship ""Revenge"" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts."
L451667	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
L451666	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Singed a bit, were you?
L451663	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
L451662	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We'll never survive.
L451654	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	There will never be a need.
L451653	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I will never doubt again.
L451652	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
L451651	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Well ... you were dead.
L451650	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"I told you, ""I would always come for you."" Why didn't you wait for me?"
L451649	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
L451648	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Can you move at all?
L451358	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	This is true love. You think this happens every day?
L451357	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But how can you be sure?
L451356	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Hear this now: I will come for you.
L451355	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But what if something happens to you?
L451354	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Of course you will.
L451353	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I fear I'll never see you again.
L451339	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	As you wish.
L451338	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
L451336	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	As you wish.
L451335	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
L451549	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
L451548	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Why should that make such a difference?
L451546	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
L451545	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Why is that, do you think?
L451542	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
L451541	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And a good thing too.
L451540	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You're quick.
L451539	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
L451538	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
L451537	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
L451536	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
L451535	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I could kill you now.
L451534	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
L451533	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
L451532	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I believe you -- So what happens now?
L451531	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
L451527	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
L451526	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Finish him, finish him. Your way.
L451525	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	What do I do?
L451524	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
L451457	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'm waiting!
L451456	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
L451445	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
L451444	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
L451443	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
L451442	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
L451441	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I thought I was going faster.
L451440	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Faster!
L451413	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Veer left. Left. Left!
L451412	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I only dog paddle.
L451397	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Anybody want a peanut?
L451396	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	No more rhymes now, I mean it.
L451382	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	"Am I going mad or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass."
L451381	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
L451380	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
L451379	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You never said anything about killing anyone.
L451378	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
L451377	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
L451376	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Who's Guilder?
L451375	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
L452009	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I'll be right back.
L452008	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
L451965	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I hope we win...
L451964	u7148	m480	INIGO	What?
L451963	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Inigo.
L451962	u7148	m480	INIGO	Right, right, sorry.
L451961	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
L451955	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
L451954	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where did you get that?
L451953	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Will this do?
L451950	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Over the Albino, I think.
L451949	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
L451934	u7148	m480	INIGO	We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
L451933	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You've been mostly dead all day.
L451928	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
L451927	u7148	m480	INIGO	Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
L451926	u7148	m480	INIGO	We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
L451925	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Has it been fifteen minutes?
L451924	u7148	m480	INIGO	What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
L451923	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
L451861	u7148	m480	INIGO	I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
L451860	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I have a little.
L451859	u7148	m480	INIGO	Have you any money?
L451858	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	The body?
L451857	u7148	m480	INIGO	Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
L451835	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Everybody ... MOVE!!
L451834	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- Fezzik, please --
L451832	u7148	m480	INIGO	His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
L451831	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	The Man in Black?
L451808	u7148	m480	INIGO	Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
L451807	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	But you don't know where he is.
L451806	u7148	m480	INIGO	To find the Man in Black, obviously.
L451805	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	-- where?
L451804	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
L451803	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	-- what? --
L451802	u7148	m480	INIGO	No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
L451800	u7148	m480	INIGO	That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
L451799	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I don't think more than ten.
L451798	u7148	m480	INIGO	How many could you handle?
L451797	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
L451793	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Yeah?
L451792	u7148	m480	INIGO	Perhaps not. I feel fine.
L451791	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
L451790	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	True!
L451789	u7148	m480	INIGO	It's you.
L451788	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Hello.
L451395	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	If there are, we'll all be dead.
L451394	u7148	m480	INIGO	FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
L451392	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Yes, some of the time. 
L451391	u7148	m480	INIGO	Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
L451390	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	He's really very short on charm.
L451389	u7148	m480	INIGO	Probably he means no harm.
L452098	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	As you wish...
L452097	u7153	m480	THE KID	Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
L452095	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
L452094	u7153	m480	THE KID	Okay.
L452093	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
L452090	u7153	m480	THE KID	I don't mind so much.
L452089	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
L452088	u7153	m480	THE KID	What? What?
L451856	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
L451855	u7153	m480	THE KID	No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
L451852	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
L451851	u7153	m480	THE KID	Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
L451850	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	I don't understand.
L451849	u7153	m480	THE KID	Who gets Humperdinck?
L451848	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	You want me to read this or not?
L451847	u7153	m480	THE KID	Westley's only faking, right?
L451743	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
L451742	u7153	m480	THE KID	See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
L451741	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
L451734	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
L451733	u7153	m480	THE KID	Yes.
L451732	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Do you want me to go on with this?
L451731	u7153	m480	THE KID	I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
L451730	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
L451729	u7153	m480	THE KID	You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
L451660	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
L451659	u7153	m480	THE KID	Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
L451658	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Someday, you may not mind so much.
L451657	u7153	m480	THE KID	They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
L451656	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
L451655	u7153	m480	THE KID	Oh no. No, please.
L451422	u7153	m480	THE KID	No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
L451421	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Because I can stop now if you want.
L451420	u7153	m480	THE KID	Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
L451419	u7153	m480	THE KID	Well, I wasn't nervous.
L451418	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
L451417	u7153	m480	THE KID	What?
L451360	u7153	m480	THE KID	-- murdered by pirates is good --
L451359	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
L451352	u7153	m480	THE KID	I don't be-leeve this.
L451351	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
L451349	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
L451348	u7153	m480	THE KID	-- well, when does it get good?
L451347	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	-- wait, just wait --
L451346	u7153	m480	THE KID	What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
L451345	u7153	m480	THE KID	-hold it, hold it-
L451333	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
L451332	u7153	m480	THE KID	Yeah. It's really good.
L451331	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
L451330	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
L451329	u7153	m480	THE KID	It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
L451327	u7153	m480	THE KID	Has it got any sports in it?
L451326	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
L451325	u7153	m480	THE KID	A book?
L451324	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Open it up.
L451323	u7153	m480	THE KID	What is it?
L451322	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	I brought you a special present.
L451814	u7157	m480	YELLIN	The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
L451813	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Double it. My Princess must be safe.
L451812	u7157	m480	YELLIN	The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
L451811	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Rise and report.
L451775	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Try ruling the world sometime.
L451774	u7157	m480	YELLIN	It won't be easy, Sire.
L451773	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
L451772	u7157	m480	YELLIN	Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
L451771	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
L451766	u7157	m480	YELLIN	My spy network has heard no such news.
L451765	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
L451764	u7157	m480	YELLIN	Sire.
L451763	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Yellin.
L452061	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
L452060	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
L452059	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
L452058	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
L452055	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
L452054	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
L452053	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
L452052	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	No.  To the pain.
L452051	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
L451696	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	DEATH FIRST!!
L451695	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	For the last time -- SURRENDER!
L451693	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It will not happen!
L451692	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I tell you once again -- surrender!
L451691	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
L451690	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
L451689	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
L451754	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
L451753	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
L451752	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
L451751	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
L451747	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
L451746	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Yes.
L451745	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
L451724	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Of course.
L451723	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
L451705	u7152	m480	RUGEN	I swear it will be done.
L451704	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
L451557	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
L451556	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Could this be a trap?
L451555	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
L451554	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Shall we track them both?
L451553	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
L451552	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Who won? How did it end?
L451551	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
L452086	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
L452085	u7148	m480	INIGO	You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
L452073	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	In that case --
L452072	u7148	m480	INIGO	No.
L452071	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I thought he was with you.
L452070	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where's Fezzik?
L451981	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Light him.
L451980	u7148	m480	INIGO	Now?
L451978	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Not yet.
L451977	u7148	m480	INIGO	Now?
L451960	u7148	m480	INIGO	I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
L451959	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
L451958	u7148	m480	INIGO	Why? You can't even lift one.
L451952	u7148	m480	INIGO	There we cannot help you.
L451951	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
L451944	u7148	m480	INIGO	Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
L451943	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	And our assets?
L451942	u7148	m480	INIGO	And it is guarded by sixty men.
L451938	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
L451937	u7148	m480	INIGO	Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
L451936	u7148	m480	INIGO	Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
L451935	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
L451930	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
L451929	u7148	m480	INIGO	Your guess is as good as mine --
L452039	u7148	m480	INIGO	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
L452038	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- anything you want --
L452037	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- offer me everything I ask for --
L452036	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- all that I have and more please --
L452035	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- power too -- promise me that --
L452034	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- yes --
L452033	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- offer me money --
L452032	u7152	m480	RUGEN	No --
L452030	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Stop saying that!
L452029	u7148	m480	INIGO	Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
L451917	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
L451916	u7148	m480	INIGO	Thank you for everything.
L451910	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
L451909	u7148	m480	INIGO	Humiliations galore!
L451892	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	"Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said ""to blave."" And, as we all know, ""to blave"" means ""to bluff."" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated"
L451891	u7148	m480	INIGO	True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
L451887	u7148	m480	INIGO	What's that?
L451886	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
L451885	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
L451884	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's dead. He can't talk.
L451883	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
L451882	u7148	m480	INIGO	I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
L451881	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Are you a rotten liar.
L451880	u7148	m480	INIGO	This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
L451879	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
L451878	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sixty-five.
L451877	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
L451876	u7148	m480	INIGO	We're really in a terrible rush.
L451875	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Hah?
L451874	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sir. Sir.
L451872	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
L451871	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's already dead.
L451870	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
L451865	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
L451864	u7148	m480	INIGO	Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
L451863	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	What? What?
L451521	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
L451520	u7148	m480	INIGO	Kill me quickly.
L451518	u7148	m480	INIGO	Okay.
L451517	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Get used to disappointment.
L451516	u7148	m480	INIGO	I must know.
L451515	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	No one of consequence.
L451514	u7148	m480	INIGO	Who are you?!
L451513	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I am not left-handed either.
L451512	u7148	m480	INIGO	Tell me.
L451511	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	There's something I ought to tell you.
L451510	u7148	m480	INIGO	I ought to be after twenty years.
L451509	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're amazing!
L451507	u7148	m480	INIGO	I am not left-handed.
L451506	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And what is that?
L451505	u7148	m480	INIGO	Because I know something you don't know.
L451504	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Then why are you smiling?
L451503	u7148	m480	INIGO	I admit it -- you are better than I am.
L451502	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
L451501	u7148	m480	INIGO	You are wonderful!
L451497	u7148	m480	INIGO	Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
L451496	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
L451494	u7148	m480	INIGO	Begin!
L451493	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
L451492	u7148	m480	INIGO	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
L451491	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
L451490	u7148	m480	INIGO	You are ready, then?
L451489	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
L451488	u7148	m480	INIGO	More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
L451487	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You've done nothing but study swordplay?
L451486	u7148	m480	INIGO	"I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."""
L451485	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	How old were you?
L451481	u7148	m480	INIGO	My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
L451480	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Do you always begin conversations this way?
L451478	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Again. Thank you.
L451477	u7148	m480	INIGO	We'll wait until you're ready.
L451473	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Nothing comes to mind.
L451472	u7148	m480	INIGO	You don't know any way you'll trust me?
L451471	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
L451470	u7148	m480	INIGO	I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
L451469	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
L451468	u7148	m480	INIGO	But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
L451467	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	That does put a damper on our relationship.
L451466	u7148	m480	INIGO	I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
L451465	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
L451464	u7148	m480	INIGO	I do not suppose you could speed things up?
L451463	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Thank you.
L451462	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sorry.
L451461	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
L451460	u7148	m480	INIGO	Slow going?
L451455	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Oh, have it your way.
L451454	u7148	m480	INIGO	Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
L451453	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You know what a hurry we're in.
L451452	u7148	m480	INIGO	I want to duel him left-handed.
L451450	u7148	m480	INIGO	You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
L451449	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
L451438	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Inconceivable!
L451437	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
L451435	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
L451434	u7148	m480	INIGO	Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
L451411	u7148	m480	INIGO	I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
L451410	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Go in, get after her!
L451408	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	What?
L451407	u7148	m480	INIGO	No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
L451406	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
L451405	u7148	m480	INIGO	You're sure nobody's following us?
L451404	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
L451401	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	That would be inconceivable.
L451400	u7148	m480	INIGO	Making sure nobody's following us.
L451601	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
L451600	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You guessed wrong.
L451599	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
L451598	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	What's so funny?
L451593	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I will. And I choose --
L451592	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Then make your choice.
L451591	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
L451590	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
L451589	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
L451588	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're just stalling now.
L451587	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
L451586	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Australia.
L451585	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Wait till I get going! Where was I?
L451584	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
L451583	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
L451582	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You've made your decision then7
L451581	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
L451578	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Hmm.
L451577	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
L451576	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I smell nothing.
L451575	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Inhale this, but do not touch.
L451574	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Good. Then pour the wine.
L451573	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I accept.
L451571	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	For the Princess?
L451570	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
L451569	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Morons.
L451568	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Yes.
L451567	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
L451566	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're that smart?
L451565	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
L451564	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
L451563	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
L451562	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
L451561	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
L451560	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Let me explain-
L451922	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Bye.
L451921	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	It would take a miracle. Bye!
L451920	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Think it'll work?
L451919	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Have fun storming the castle.
L451918	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Bye-bye, boys.
L451915	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	A good hour. Yeah.
L451914	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Yeah, an hour.
L451913	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	An hour.
L451912	u7154	m480	VALERIE	The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
L451905	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
L451904	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Nobody's hearing nothing!
L451903	u7154	m480	VALERIE	A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
L451902	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	I'm not listening.
L451901	u7154	m480	VALERIE	What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
L451900	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
L451899	u7154	m480	VALERIE	He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
L451898	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Don't say another word, Valerie.
L451897	u7154	m480	VALERIE	"True love. He said, ""true love,"" Max. My God --"
L451896	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
L451895	u7154	m480	VALERIE	I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
L451894	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	-- get back, witch --
L451319	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Maybe he won't.
L451318	u7153	m480	THE KID	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
L451317	u7151	m480	MOTHER	You are sick, that's why he's here.
L451316	u7153	m480	THE KID	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
L451315	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Your grandfather's here.
L451314	u7153	m480	THE KID	What?
L451313	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Guess what.
L451312	u7153	m480	THE KID	A little bit.
L451311	u7151	m480	MOTHER	You feeling any better?
L456403	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Yes....
L456402	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Mia...?
L456401	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	What was her name?  The one I met.
L456400	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Excuse me???
L456399	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	What was her name?
L456398	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
L456397	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	You did miss --
L456396	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
L456395	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	You did.
L456394	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Two: what if I didn't miss?
L456393	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Dad...
L456392	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
L456391	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	You taking any medication?
L456390	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
L456426	u7216	m486	MIA	So I can move on.  You too.
L456425	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Why?
L456421	u7216	m486	MIA	What?
L456420	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Then you get it.  You'll understand.
L456419	u7216	m486	MIA	I've been dreaming about this.
L456418	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Wait.  I want to tell you something.
L456417	u7216	m486	MIA	I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
L456379	u7216	m486	MIA	And glow happily ever after.
L456378	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
L456377	u7216	m486	MIA	Dysfunctional --
L456376	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
L456375	u7216	m486	MIA	She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
L456373	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
L456372	u7216	m486	MIA	No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
L456369	u7216	m486	MIA	Like now?
L456368	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	"That's what it asked me.  ""What do you want?""  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment."
L456367	u7216	m486	MIA	What did it want?
L456362	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
L456361	u7216	m486	MIA	Of what?
L456352	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	How?
L456351	u7216	m486	MIA	The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
L456350	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Nothing is real until it's perceived.
L456347	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	A quantum one.
L456346	u7216	m486	MIA	What universe are you in, Paul?
L456345	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Could be.
L456343	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
L456342	u7216	m486	MIA	We flopped the first time out.
L456341	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	It's an experiment.
L456340	u7216	m486	MIA	Why am I doing this?
L456339	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	That's the physicist's playground.
L456338	u7216	m486	MIA	A place you've never been.
L456337	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Where to?
L456336	u7216	m486	MIA	Could you?
L456335	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	I could go out of town.
L456334	u7216	m486	MIA	What?
L456333	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Okay.
L456332	u7216	m486	MIA	I'm heading out of town.
L456331	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Could we go somewhere?
L456326	u7216	m486	MIA	Day or night?
L456325	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	I've been dreaming about you.
L467152	u7247	m489	LANDO	We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
L467151	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
L467109	u7247	m489	LANDO	We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
L467108	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
L467101	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
L467100	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
L467099	u7247	m489	LANDO	You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
L467098	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
L467022	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right. Stand by.
L467021	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
L467019	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
L467018	u7247	m489	LANDO	Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
L466818	u7242	m489	BEN	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
L466817	u7249	m489	LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
L466816	u7242	m489	BEN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
L466815	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
L466814	u7242	m489	BEN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
L466813	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I have no sister.
L466812	u7242	m489	BEN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
L466811	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
L466810	u7242	m489	BEN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
L466809	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
L466808	u7242	m489	BEN	To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
L466807	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I had to help my friends.
L466806	u7242	m489	BEN	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
L466805	u7249	m489	LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
L466804	u7242	m489	BEN	You cannot escape your destiny.
L466803	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it, Ben.
L466802	u7242	m489	BEN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
L466801	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's still good in him.
L466796	u7242	m489	BEN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
L466795	u7249	m489	LUKE	You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
L466793	u7242	m489	BEN	Yoda will always be with you.
L466792	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
L466672	u7245	m489	HAN	Who are you?
L466671	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
L466670	u7245	m489	HAN	Where am I?
L466669	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Your eyesight will return in time.
L466668	u7245	m489	HAN	I can't see.
L466667	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
L467037	u7252	m489	VADER	His lightsaber.
L467036	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
L466915	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
L466914	u7252	m489	VADER	They are clear, my Master.
L466913	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
L466912	u7252	m489	VADER	I have felt him, my Master.
L466911	u7252	m489	VADER	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
L466910	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	I told you to remain on the command ship.
L466857	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes, my Master.
L466856	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
L466855	u7252	m489	VADER	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
L466854	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
L466853	u7252	m489	VADER	What is thy bidding, my Master?
L466772	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
L466771	u7252	m489	VADER	As you wish.
L466770	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
L466769	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes, my Master.
L466768	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
L466767	u7252	m489	VADER	The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
L466950	u7249	m489	LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
L466949	u7245	m489	HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
L466930	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right.
L466929	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey!
L466926	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah, sure.
L466925	u7249	m489	LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
L466924	u7245	m489	HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
L466893	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
L466892	u7245	m489	HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
L466890	u7249	m489	LUKE	We got separated.
L466889	u7245	m489	HAN	I thought she was with you.
L466879	u7249	m489	LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
L466878	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
L466867	u7245	m489	HAN	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
L466866	u7249	m489	LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
L466865	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know.  Fly casual.
L466864	u7245	m489	HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
L466863	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
L466850	u7249	m489	LUKE	All set.
L466849	u7245	m489	HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
L466845	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
L466844	u7245	m489	HAN	You got her warmed?
L466837	u7249	m489	LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
L466836	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke.
L466759	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
L466758	u7245	m489	HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
L466721	u7245	m489	HAN	Oh... great!
L466720	u7249	m489	LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
L466719	u7245	m489	HAN	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
L466718	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
L466717	u7245	m489	HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
L466709	u7245	m489	HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
L466708	u7249	m489	LUKE	The same as always.
L466707	u7245	m489	HAN	How are we doing?
L466706	u7249	m489	LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
L466705	u7245	m489	HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
L466704	u7249	m489	LUKE	Are you all right?
L466703	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke!
L466702	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han!
L467183	u7245	m489	HAN	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
L467182	u7248	m489	LEIA	Yes.
L467181	u7245	m489	HAN	You love him, don't you?
L467180	u7248	m489	LEIA	He wasn't. I can feel it.
L467179	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
L467081	u7245	m489	HAN	Here's the terminal.
L467080	u7248	m489	LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
L467048	u7245	m489	HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!
L467047	u7248	m489	LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
L467015	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
L467014	u7248	m489	LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
L466995	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hold me.
L466994	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sorry.
L466993	u7245	m489	HAN	Ahhh...
L466992	u7248	m489	LEIA	I...
L466960	u7248	m489	LEIA	I don't know.
L466959	u7245	m489	HAN	What's going on?
L466877	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
L466876	u7248	m489	LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
L466862	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
L466861	u7248	m489	LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
L466848	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
L466847	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
L466756	u7248	m489	LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
L466755	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
L466675	u7248	m489	LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
L466674	u7245	m489	HAN	Leia!
L466673	u7248	m489	LEIA	Someone who loves you.
L466843	u7245	m489	HAN	You, too.
L466842	u7247	m489	LANDO	Good luck.
L466840	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
L466839	u7245	m489	HAN	Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
L466820	u7247	m489	LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
L466819	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, look at you, a general, huh?
L466761	u7247	m489	LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
L466760	u7245	m489	HAN	Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
L466746	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
L466745	u7245	m489	HAN	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
L466744	u7247	m489	LANDO	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
L466743	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
L466737	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm trying!
L466736	u7247	m489	LANDO	Lower it!
L466735	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando, grab it!
L466733	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando!
L466732	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han! Chewie?
L467118	u7245	m489	HAN	Let's see.
L467117	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
L467106	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
L467105	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
L467104	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, Artoo, hurry!
L467103	u7245	m489	HAN	Come on! Come on!
L467102	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	We're coming!
L466945	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
L466944	u7245	m489	HAN	What did he say?
L466940	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
L466939	u7245	m489	HAN	Proper?!
L466938	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
L466937	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
L466936	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
L466935	u7245	m489	HAN	What are you telling them?
L466852	u7245	m489	HAN	All right, hang on.
L466851	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Here we go again.
L466715	u7245	m489	HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
L466714	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
L466713	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
L466712	u7245	m489	HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
L466711	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
L466619	u7252	m489	VADER	I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
L466618	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	We shall double our efforts.
L466617	u7252	m489	VADER	That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
L466616	u7252	m489	VADER	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
L466615	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
L466614	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
L466613	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
L466612	u7252	m489	VADER	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
L466611	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
L466610	u7252	m489	VADER	You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
L466609	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
L467176	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
L467175	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
L467174	u7253	m489	WEDGE	There it is!
L467160	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
L467159	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
L467158	u7247	m489	LANDO	Here goes nothing.
L467157	u7253	m489	WEDGE	I'm going in.
L467137	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
L467136	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Good shot, Red Two.
L467052	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Red Leader standing by.
L467051	u7247	m489	LANDO	All wings report in.
L467028	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh, no.
L467027	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
L467026	u7248	m489	LEIA	Quiet.
L467025	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
L467017	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
L467016	u7248	m489	LEIA	What's he saying?
L466947	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Your Royal Highness.
L466946	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh!
L466682	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
L466681	u7248	m489	LEIA	Ugh!
L466988	u7249	m489	LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
L466987	u7248	m489	LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
L466986	u7249	m489	LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
L466985	u7248	m489	LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
L466984	u7249	m489	LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
L466983	u7248	m489	LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
L466982	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes. It's you Leia.
L466981	u7249	m489	LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
L466980	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
L466979	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
L466978	u7248	m489	LEIA	Your father?
L466977	u7249	m489	LUKE	He's my father.
L466974	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
L466973	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
L466972	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
L466971	u7248	m489	LEIA	She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
L466970	u7249	m489	LUKE	Tell me.
L466969	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
L466968	u7249	m489	LUKE	What do you remember?
L466967	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
L466966	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
L466882	u7249	m489	LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia!
L466881	u7248	m489	LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
L467146	u7249	m489	LUKE	Never-r-r!
L467145	u7252	m489	VADER	Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
L467144	u7252	m489	VADER	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
L467143	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you.
L467142	u7252	m489	VADER	You cannot hide forever, Luke.
L467133	u7252	m489	VADER	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
L467132	u7249	m489	LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
L467131	u7252	m489	VADER	There is no conflict.
L467130	u7249	m489	LUKE	Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
L467128	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you, father.
L467127	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
L467012	u7252	m489	VADER	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
L467011	u7249	m489	LUKE	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
L467010	u7252	m489	VADER	If that is your destiny.
L467009	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
L467008	u7252	m489	VADER	You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
L467007	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
L467006	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come with me.
L467002	u7252	m489	VADER	So, you have accepted the truth.
L467001	u7249	m489	LUKE	I know, father.
L467000	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor has been expecting you.
L466790	u7254	m489	YODA	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
L466789	u7249	m489	LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
L466788	u7249	m489	LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
L466787	u7254	m489	YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
L466786	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes.
L466785	u7254	m489	YODA	Told you, did he?
L466784	u7254	m489	YODA	Your father he is.
L466783	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
L466779	u7254	m489	YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
L466778	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
L466777	u7254	m489	YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
L466776	u7249	m489	LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
L466653	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Disintegrated?
L466652	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
L466651	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
L466650	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
L466649	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh. Well, yes.
L466648	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
L466647	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
L466646	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
L470995	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	So what's your next move, Valiant?
L470994	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Well, I'll be...
L470993	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
L470981	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
L470980	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Oh, a ladies man, huh?
L470973	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah...
L470972	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You serve martinis, doncha?
L470971	u7288	m492	DOLORES	We don't serve formula. Snookums.
L470992	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
L470991	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
L470988	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
L470987	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it then?
L470986	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
L470983	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
L470982	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
L470978	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
L470977	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
L470976	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
L470975	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
L470974	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
L470863	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
L470862	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
L470861	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
L470860	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Shoulda guessed.
L470859	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
L470858	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
L470857	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
L470856	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
L470855	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
L470788	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
L470787	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
L470786	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
L470785	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
L470783	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
L470782	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A tweeting bird?
L470781	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	What's this, Roger?
L471319	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
L471318	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
L471317	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
L471316	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
L471315	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
L471314	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'll bet.
L471313	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
L471208	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, no...
L471207	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Sounds like singin'.
L471206	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's that comin' from the bar?
L471205	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
L471204	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
L471203	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
L471202	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon, right?
L471201	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
L471200	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
L471199	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
L471198	u7295	m492	VALIANT	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
L471197	u7288	m492	DOLORES	What was <u>that</u>?
L471083	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
L471082	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
L471079	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
L471078	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
L471073	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
L471072	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So what's the scam, Eddie?
L471066	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
L471065	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
L471057	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
L471056	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you decided to help him after all?
L471055	u7288	m492	DOLORES	It's all yours.
L471054	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
L471053	u7288	m492	DOLORES	He's a riot.
L471048	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
L471047	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
L470998	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's a Toon... who cares?
L470997	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
L470990	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
L470989	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
L470985	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L470984	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
L470969	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
L470968	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Do you think the rabbit did it?
L470962	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Bastards put him on notice.
L470961	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
L470960	u7288	m492	DOLORES	A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
L470957	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
L470956	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
L470835	u7288	m492	DOLORES	R.K. Maroon.
L470834	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Check the scrawl.
L470833	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Is this paper even good?
L470832	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
L470831	u7288	m492	DOLORES	This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
L470830	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
L470829	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
L471487	u7289	m492	DOOM	That's right, me.
L471486	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You?
L471483	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
L471482	u7289	m492	DOOM	Surprised?
L471481	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
L471447	u7289	m492	DOOM	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
L471446	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
L471445	u7289	m492	DOOM	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
L471444	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell's a freeway?
L471443	u7289	m492	DOOM	Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
L471441	u7289	m492	DOOM	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
L471440	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
L471427	u7289	m492	DOOM	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
L471426	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
L471425	u7289	m492	DOOM	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
L471424	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So you're Cloverleaf?
L471423	u7289	m492	DOOM	No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
L471411	u7289	m492	DOOM	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
L471410	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
L471409	u7289	m492	DOOM	These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
L471258	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
L471257	u7289	m492	DOOM	Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
L471253	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
L471252	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
L471145	u7289	m492	DOOM	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
L471144	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
L471143	u7289	m492	DOOM	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
L471142	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
L471141	u7289	m492	DOOM	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
L471140	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
L471139	u7289	m492	DOOM	Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
L471138	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
L471137	u7289	m492	DOOM	They?
L471136	u7295	m492	VALIANT	They must've taken it off me.
L471132	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
L471131	u7289	m492	DOOM	Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
L471128	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Ask her...
L471127	u7289	m492	DOOM	Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
L470933	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
L470932	u7289	m492	DOOM	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
L470931	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
L470930	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
L470929	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
L470925	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
L470924	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
L470923	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
L471160	u7290	m492	EARL	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
L471159	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
L471158	u7290	m492	EARL	Does it hurt?
L471157	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No...
L471156	u7290	m492	EARL	You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
L471155	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What am I, Earl?
L471154	u7290	m492	EARL	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
L471153	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Toon cops worked me over.
L471152	u7290	m492	EARL	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
L471151	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
L471150	u7290	m492	EARL	Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
L471406	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Eddie, come on.
L471405	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hold on a second.
L471397	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	He made me laugh.
L471396	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
L471395	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
L471394	u7295	m492	VALIANT	A joker to the end.
L471393	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
L471392	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it?
L471391	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
L471390	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How did you get onto Doom?
L471387	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's right here in the...
L471386	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Where is he?
L471385	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
L471384	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I didn't know who I could trust.
L471383	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why didn't you tell me?
L471382	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
L471379	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
L471378	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
L471377	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
L471376	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You shot Roger.
L471187	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
L471186	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
L471185	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
L471184	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So altruistic.
L471182	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
L471181	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
L471180	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
L471179	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
L471178	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
L471177	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	No, no, no... I love my husband.
L471176	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
L471175	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
L471174	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
L471173	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Toons aren't given imperfections.
L471172	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
L471170	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
L471169	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
L471168	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's because I don't have a doorbell.
L471167	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
L471130	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
L471129	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
L471493	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
L471492	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Doom.
L471491	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	What the hell is that?
L470951	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
L470950	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's with the dip?
L470940	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
L470939	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
L470910	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Wait here...
L470909	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What a gasser.
L470908	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
L470906	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
L470905	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Now what?
L470903	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what you woke me up for?
L470902	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
L471349	u7293	m492	MAROON	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
L471348	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Take it easy.
L471347	u7293	m492	MAROON	You tricked me, damn you!
L471346	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, I don't.
L471345	u7293	m492	MAROON	You got the will in there, don't ya?
L471343	u7293	m492	MAROON	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
L471342	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
L471341	u7293	m492	MAROON	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
L471340	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
L471339	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That was the idea.
L471338	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant!  You surprised me.
L471324	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stop what?
L471323	u7293	m492	MAROON	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
L471322	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe.  Why?
L471321	u7293	m492	MAROON	Have you got the will?
L471320	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
L471099	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
L471098	u7293	m492	MAROON	I've already seen your photographs.
L471097	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
L471096	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
L471095	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
L470894	u7293	m492	MAROON	Sure, Valiant, sure...
L470893	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
L470888	u7293	m492	MAROON	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
L470887	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
L470820	u7295	m492	VALIANT	As soon as is humanly possible.
L470819	u7293	m492	MAROON	When will I hear from you?
L470818	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aren't you the lucky one...
L470817	u7293	m492	MAROON	I got him on loan from Disney.
L470813	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So's the job.
L470812	u7293	m492	MAROON	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
L470811	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
L470810	u7293	m492	MAROON	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
L470809	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't work in Toontown.
L470808	u7293	m492	MAROON	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
L470807	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So what do you want me to do?
L470806	u7293	m492	MAROON	"Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up."
L470805	u7293	m492	MAROON	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
L470804	u7295	m492	VALIANT	One too many safes dropped on his head?
L470803	u7293	m492	MAROON	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
L470802	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
L470801	u7293	m492	MAROON	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
L470795	u7293	m492	MAROON	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
L470794	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
L470793	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
L471518	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	From this box here...
L471517	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
L471516	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only time will tell.
L471515	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
L471514	u7295	m492	VALIANT	By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
L471512	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
L471511	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, kid, you're a real hero.
L471508	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
L471507	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Keep reading...
L471505	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Good idea.
L471504	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you oughta read it to her.
L471503	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471502	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
L471498	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah...
L471497	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
L471496	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
L471456	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
L471455	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
L471369	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
L471368	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin' in there?
L471335	u7295	m492	VALIANT	... I'd head for Cucamonga.
L471334	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471333	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I don't make it back here by ten...
L471332	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I rest my case.
L471331	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Two bits.
L471330	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
L471329	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
L471328	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Forget it.
L471327	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
L471326	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
L471325	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
L471311	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, it's not.
L471310	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Wrong number?
L471309	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Get away from there.
L471308	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I'll get it.
L471307	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
L471306	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Safe?
L471305	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
L471304	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
L471303	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
L471302	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A Toon?  Noooo.
L471301	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
L471300	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
L471299	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
L471296	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What is this, Twenty Questions?
L471295	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
L471294	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Me.
L471293	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Say, who's this guy laughin'?
L471291	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We can't do anything till it's dark.
L471290	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
L471289	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My brother.  Get inside.
L471288	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
L471264	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
L471263	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
L471261	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
L471260	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
L471259	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
L471256	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
L471255	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
L471254	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
L471225	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
L471224	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
L471223	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
L471222	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
L471221	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
L471220	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
L471219	u7295	m492	VALIANT	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
L471218	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
L471217	u7295	m492	VALIANT	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
L471216	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
L471215	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
L471214	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, don't I get an encore?
L471081	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
L471080	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
L471077	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
L471076	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	How do you know that?
L471075	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
L471074	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	The habeus corpus is thickening.
L471071	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
L471070	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
L471069	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
L471064	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
L471063	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
L471062	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
L471061	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
L471060	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
L471059	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, that's better.
L471058	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Does this help?
L471039	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't ever forget that.
L471038	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
L471037	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
L471034	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
L471033	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
L471019	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
L471018	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
L471017	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
L471016	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
L471008	u7295	m492	VALIANT	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
L471007	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
L471006	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
L471005	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
L471004	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
L471003	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
L471002	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin'?
L471001	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Aah!
L471000	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aah!
L470897	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Divorce?  Never!
L470896	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
L470882	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
L470881	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Pattycake!  Pattycake!
L490215	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
L490214	u7527	m509	AARON	Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
L490171	u7527	m509	AARON	You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
L490170	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You askin' me to clear out now?
L490167	u7527	m509	AARON	They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
L490166	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
L490134	u7533	m509	ETHAN	It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
L490133	u7527	m509	AARON	It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
L490121	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
L490120	u7527	m509	AARON	But Mose Harper said...
L490119	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How should I know?
L490118	u7527	m509	AARON	How's California?
L490272	u7528	m509	BEN	I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
L490271	u7541	m509	MARTHA	What, Ben?
L490270	u7528	m509	BEN	It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
L490144	u7528	m509	BEN	It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
L490143	u7541	m509	MARTHA	Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
L490127	u7541	m509	MARTHA	That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
L490126	u7528	m509	BEN	An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
L490125	u7541	m509	MARTHA	Lucy's going on seventeen now...
L490434	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
L490433	u7529	m509	BRAD	It was, I tell you!
L490432	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What you saw wasn't Lucy.
L490423	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Huh...? No...no water.
L490422	u7529	m509	BRAD	Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
L490413	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
L490412	u7529	m509	BRAD	You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
L490408	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
L490407	u7529	m509	BRAD	They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
L490340	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Why don't you finish the job?
L490339	u7529	m509	BRAD	Let's get along...
L490251	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
L490250	u7529	m509	BRAD	Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
L490913	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	I ain't wearing no gun.
L490912	u7542	m509	MARTIN	It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
L490910	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
L490909	u7542	m509	MARTIN	If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
L490908	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
L490907	u7542	m509	MARTIN	As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
L490906	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
L490905	u7542	m509	MARTIN	<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
L490973	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	Yes sir...
L490972	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
L490934	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
L490933	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
L490923	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
L490922	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	Dunno...Seems so.
L490921	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You all right, sergeant?
L490917	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	In that case, give the boys room...
L490916	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	No sir...pleasure.
L490915	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
L490332	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
L490331	u7530	m509	CHARLIE	This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
L490330	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Another one, eh?
L491005	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
L491004	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I say NO!
L491000	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Now mount up, son...
L490999	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
L490996	u7533	m509	ETHAN	There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
L490995	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
L490989	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
L490988	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	How many, would you say?
L490987	u7533	m509	ETHAN	We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
L490930	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
L490929	u7533	m509	ETHAN	This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
L490928	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
L490919	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
L490918	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
L490889	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
L490888	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
L490386	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You got one now!
L490385	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
L490384	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I didn't give any order to fire!
L490371	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	How far's the river from here, Mose?
L490370	u7533	m509	ETHAN	If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
L490365	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Just keep goin'...
L490364	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You got any more orders, Captain?
L490359	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
L490358	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
L490357	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
L490352	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
L490351	u7533	m509	ETHAN	It's what we're here for, ain't it?
L490350	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
L490349	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
L490342	u7533	m509	ETHAN	By what you preach...none!
L490341	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	What good does that do?
L490318	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
L490317	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
L490316	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	He cometh forth like a...
L490224	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
L490223	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You fit a lot of descriptions.
L490222	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Got a warrant?
L490221	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
L490220	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
L490219	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
L490218	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
L490213	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
L490212	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
L490211	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You ain't goin'...
L490207	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
L490206	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
L491019	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Yes, sir...
L491018	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
L491017	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
L491016	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
L491015	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	If there's anything I can do, sir...
L491014	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
L491013	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
L491012	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
L491011	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Sir?
L491010	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
L491009	u7536	m509	GREENHILL	Captain Clayton...Captain!
L491008	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	What in...?
L490971	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
L490970	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
L490969	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
L490951	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
L490950	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	And what makes you think he's in this territory?
L490947	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
L490946	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	JOINT action?
L490945	u7540	m509	LIEUTENANT	My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
L490944	u7531	m509	CLAYTON	Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?

L490962	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Scar! Where's he holed in?
L490961	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...

L490762	u7543	m509	MOSE	Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
L490761	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
L490760	u7543	m509	MOSE	Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
L490759	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, the reward still stands...
L490752	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You were born old...
L490751	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
L490750	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
L490382	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
L490381	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
L490363	u7533	m509	ETHAN	SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
L490362	u7543	m509	MOSE	Ay-eh...They was here...
L490542	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Ain't yours yet.
L490541	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
L490538	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
L490537	u7533	m509	ETHAN	And maybe you lie...
L490536	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
L490535	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Keep talking.
L490534	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
L490533	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
L490532	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
L490531	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Talk!
L490526	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	You got it with you?
L490525	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That's what I said.
L490524	u7534	m509	FUTTERMAN	You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
L490523	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How'd you come by this?
L490708	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
L490707	u7535	m509	GENERAL	Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
L490706	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
L490703	u7535	m509	GENERAL	Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
L490702	u7533	m509	ETHAN	My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
L490698	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
L490697	u7535	m509	GENERAL	I beg your pardon?
L490696	u7533	m509	ETHAN	<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
L490695	u7535	m509	GENERAL	Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
L490998	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
L490997	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
L490994	u7542	m509	MARTIN	She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
L490993	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
L490992	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
L490991	u7533	m509	ETHAN	It's what I'm countin' on.
L490990	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
L490877	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What's goin' on?
L490876	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What's that got to do with us?
L490859	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
L490858	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
L490857	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Not no more.
L490856	u7542	m509	MARTIN	'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
L490850	u7542	m509	MARTIN	We won't be here...Come on!
L490849	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They'll be back...
L490848	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Over there!
L490847	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Go on! Get out of here while you can...
L490830	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
L490829	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How? She's even forgot her own language!
L490823	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
L490822	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Why didn't he make his move back there?
L490821	u7533	m509	ETHAN	He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
L490820	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You figger Scar means to kill us?
L490796	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Not likely.
L490795	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Stay out here.
L490774	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
L490773	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Never heard of him...
L490772	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
L490770	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
L490769	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Lemme alone...
L490719	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
L490718	u7542	m509	MARTIN	No...She's not...
L490678	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
L490677	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, you're a widower now...
L490667	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
L490666	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
L490665	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
L490663	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What's the sense in it!
L490662	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Nine...  Ten!
L490661	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Ethan, quit it!
L490653	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
L490652	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I think maybe we oughta...
L490651	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
L490650	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Think she means for us to follow?
L490649	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
L490648	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
L490643	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
L490642	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You ask her!
L490638	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Look?
L490637	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
L490633	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Cut it out, will ya...
L490632	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
L490628	u7533	m509	ETHAN	And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
L490627	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
L490626	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
L490625	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What?
L490624	u7533	m509	ETHAN	<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
L490619	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Think it might be...?
L490618	u7533	m509	ETHAN	What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
L490616	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Forget it...
L490615	u7542	m509	MARTIN	But I just bought a good blanket.
L490614	u7533	m509	ETHAN	When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
L490613	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Scar?
L490612	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
L490560	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Whatchu doin'?...
L490559	u7533	m509	ETHAN	He just couldn't wait...
L490558	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Futterman?
L490554	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You all settled an' comfortable now?
L490553	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Oh...
L490552	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
L490551	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What's that?
L490550	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
L490548	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
L490547	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Hey! What's the idea...?
L490504	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Good night.
L490503	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
L490502	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
L490501	u7533	m509	ETHAN	How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
L490500	u7542	m509	MARTIN	All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
L490499	u7533	m509	ETHAN	That don't make 'em kin...
L490498	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
L490497	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
L490496	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Because she's my...my...
L490495	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Why?
L490494	u7542	m509	MARTIN	I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
L490493	u7533	m509	ETHAN	He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
L490492	u7542	m509	MARTIN	YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
L490491	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
L490490	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Good night...
L490489	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Good night...Laurie...
L490446	u7533	m509	ETHAN	An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
L490445	u7542	m509	MARTIN	And you think we got a chance to find her?
L490444	u7533	m509	ETHAN	No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
L490443	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Say it. We're beat!
L490440	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
L490439	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What you goin' to do?
L490427	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
L490426	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
L490425	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
L490424	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You all right, Ethan?
L490418	u7533	m509	ETHAN	No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
L490417	u7542	m509	MARTIN	You want us to fire a shot if...
L490411	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
L490410	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
L490409	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Easy on that!
L490402	u7533	m509	ETHAN	If they're still alive...
L490401	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
L490400	u7533	m509	ETHAN	All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
L490310	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Leggo...
L490309	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Nothing for you to see.
L490255	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
L490254	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Well, come on!
L490243	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Well, fust off...
L490242	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
L490241	u7542	m509	MARTIN	What you want me to call you?
L490240	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
L490239	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Yes, sir.
L490238	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
L490237	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
L490132	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You've done a lot of growin'...
L490131	u7542	m509	MARTIN	Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
L490731	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
L490730	u7538	m509	KEEFER	That's the breed...Course it might take time.
L490729	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Comancheros...
L490728	u7538	m509	KEEFER	There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
L490727	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
L490723	u7533	m509	ETHAN	They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
L490722	u7538	m509	KEEFER	Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
L490721	u7533	m509	ETHAN	Not far from it...
L490720	u7538	m509	KEEFER	Was your niece about their age?
L490893	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I've seen her...and she's alive.
L490892	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	You've seen her!...She's alive?
L490891	u7533	m509	ETHAN	She's not a little girl any more.
L490483	u7533	m509	ETHAN	No...not yet...
L490482	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
L490481	u7533	m509	ETHAN	You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
L490480	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Why it's just a snip of calico...
L490471	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Don't go blamin' yourself...
L490470	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I got your boy killed.
L490469	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
L490323	u7544	m509	MRS. JORGENSEN	I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
L490322	u7533	m509	ETHAN	I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
L490739	u7539	m509	LAURIE	Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!

L506992	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
L506991	u7620	m515	JANE	The moon's not down yet...
L506981	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
L506980	u7620	m515	JANE	Sure, Uncle Al.
L506979	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Can I tell you kids something?
L506957	u7620	m515	JANE	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
L506956	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
L506940	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Jesus.
L506939	u7620	m515	JANE	Blue. This blue.
L506938	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Lowe's car-?
L506905	u7620	m515	JANE	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
L506904	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
L506903	u7620	m515	JANE	If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
L506888	u7620	m515	JANE	Uncle Al-
L506887	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
L507014	u7620	m515	JANE	You're a real booger, you know it?
L507013	u7621	m515	MARTY	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
L507012	u7620	m515	JANE	Are you all right, Marty?
L507001	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane-
L507000	u7620	m515	JANE	Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
L506964	u7620	m515	JANE	Will you?
L506963	u7621	m515	MARTY	Please, Uncle Al.
L506955	u7621	m515	MARTY	Will you marry me, Jane?
L506954	u7620	m515	JANE	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
L506953	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane... you don't have to do that.
L506859	u7621	m515	MARTY	Jane, I have to talk to you.
L506858	u7620	m515	JANE	Went shopping. Why?
L506857	u7621	m515	MARTY	Where's Mom?
L506856	u7620	m515	JANE	Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
L506692	u7620	m515	JANE	Let me help you up.
L506691	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yes. Go away.
L506689	u7621	m515	MARTY	Stop it!
L506688	u7620	m515	JANE	What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
L506687	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
L506621	u7621	m515	MARTY	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
L506620	u7620	m515	JANE	I don't want your money. You're a booger.
L506619	u7621	m515	MARTY	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
L506618	u7620	m515	JANE	What's the money for?
L506616	u7620	m515	JANE	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
L506615	u7621	m515	MARTY	Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
L506611	u7620	m515	JANE	Brady's a booger and so are you!
L506610	u7621	m515	MARTY	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
L506609	u7620	m515	JANE	You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
L506663	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
L506662	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
L506661	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
L506657	u7623	m515	TAMMY	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
L506656	u7621	m515	MARTY	Rats...
L506655	u7623	m515	TAMMY	Rattling. Rustling.
L506654	u7621	m515	MARTY	What kind of noises?
L506653	u7623	m515	TAMMY	I've been hearing noises in there.
L506652	u7621	m515	MARTY	What?
L506651	u7623	m515	TAMMY	There's something else scary.
L506650	u7621	m515	MARTY	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
L506649	u7623	m515	TAMMY	I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
L506645	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... it is his third.
L506644	u7623	m515	TAMMY	For getting a divorce?
L506643	u7621	m515	MARTY	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
L506642	u7623	m515	TAMMY	What's that?
L506641	u7621	m515	MARTY	Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
L506639	u7621	m515	MARTY	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
L506638	u7623	m515	TAMMY	You booger.
L506994	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
L506993	u7621	m515	MARTY	What if I say no?
L506990	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
L506989	u7621	m515	MARTY	But Uncle Al! You said-
L506988	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
L506983	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
L506982	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah? Really?
L506962	u7621	m515	MARTY	Will you do it?
L506961	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
L506960	u7621	m515	MARTY	I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
L506959	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
L506958	u7621	m515	MARTY	No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
L506952	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
L506951	u7621	m515	MARTY	I saw what I saw.
L506950	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You're not going to let it go, are you?
L506949	u7621	m515	MARTY	I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
L506948	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
L506947	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
L506937	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	No.
L506936	u7621	m515	MARTY	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
L506935	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It could have been anything, Marty.
L506934	u7621	m515	MARTY	There! You see!
L506933	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
L506928	u7621	m515	MARTY	I told you!
L506927	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
L506926	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
L506925	u7621	m515	MARTY	I told you!
L506924	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
L506910	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
L506909	u7621	m515	MARTY	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
L506908	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
L506907	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, do you see your suspect?
L506906	u7621	m515	MARTY	I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
L506900	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
L506899	u7621	m515	MARTY	No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
L506898	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You want to know what I think?
L506897	u7621	m515	MARTY	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
L506896	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
L506895	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... was it a prescription?
L506894	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
L506893	u7621	m515	MARTY	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
L506892	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	What the hell does that matter?
L506891	u7621	m515	MARTY	Was it a prescription?
L506890	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
L506889	u7621	m515	MARTY	It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
L506850	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
L506849	u7621	m515	MARTY	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
L506848	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	A tracer. You'll like it.
L506847	u7621	m515	MARTY	What is it?
L506846	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Save this one for last.
L506845	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah... sure.
L506844	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
L506843	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah, I know. It's great!
L506842	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
L506840	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah! What is it?
L506839	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
L506834	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Good.
L506833	u7621	m515	MARTY	Sure.
L506832	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
L506831	u7621	m515	MARTY	I don't get you.
L506830	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
L506829	u7621	m515	MARTY	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
L506828	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
L506827	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
L506826	u7621	m515	MARTY	Do I need one?
L506825	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You got a pilot's license, Marty?
L506822	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
L506821	u7621	m515	MARTY	What?
L506820	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
L506818	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
L506817	u7621	m515	MARTY	She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
L506816	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Your mom's not around, is she?
L506814	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
L506813	u7621	m515	MARTY	Don't call me dear boy.
L506812	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
L506811	u7621	m515	MARTY	Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
L506810	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
L506809	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
L506808	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
L506807	u7621	m515	MARTY	It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
L506739	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
L506738	u7621	m515	MARTY	What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
L506737	u7621	m515	MARTY	What if it's some kind of monster?
L506736	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Huh?
L506735	u7621	m515	MARTY	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
L506734	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
L506733	u7621	m515	MARTY	No.
L506732	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
L506731	u7621	m515	MARTY	Yeah.
L506730	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	You all right, Marty?
L506680	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
L506679	u7621	m515	MARTY	Mom-!
L506677	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
L506676	u7621	m515	MARTY	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
L506675	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
L506977	u7622	m515	NAN	I will- be good, kids.
L506976	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
L506975	u7622	m515	NAN	You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
L506974	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	We won't!
L506973	u7622	m515	NAN	And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
L506972	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
L506971	u7622	m515	NAN	Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
L506837	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
L506836	u7622	m515	NAN	So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
L506686	u7622	m515	NAN	Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
L506685	u7624	m515	UNCLE AL	I come here because Marty needs a friend.
L542275	u7816	m529	BEN	May the Force be with you.
L542274	u7821	m529	HAN	We'll be back before you are, old man.
L542273	u7816	m529	BEN	That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
L542257	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not going out there.
L542256	u7816	m529	BEN	There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
L542255	u7821	m529	HAN	Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
L542251	u7816	m529	BEN	It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
L542250	u7821	m529	HAN	Is that good or bad?
L542249	u7816	m529	BEN	Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
L542224	u7821	m529	HAN	What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
L542223	u7816	m529	BEN	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
L542222	u7821	m529	HAN	I'll get the information.
L542221	u7816	m529	BEN	All right then, we'll use your plan.
L542220	u7821	m529	HAN	We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
L542219	u7816	m529	BEN	Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
L542218	u7821	m529	HAN	We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
L542206	u7821	m529	HAN	Not bad.
L542205	u7816	m529	BEN	You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
L542202	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not afraid of anything...
L542201	u7816	m529	BEN	Fear is their greatest weapon.
L542200	u7821	m529	HAN	Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
L542198	u7821	m529	HAN	This isn't a game, you know.
L542197	u7816	m529	BEN	Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
L542186	u7821	m529	HAN	Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
L542185	u7816	m529	BEN	A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
L542184	u7821	m529	HAN	How much do you think she's talking about?
L542183	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm beginning not to like you.
L542182	u7816	m529	BEN	I think there are some things we should talk about.
L542181	u7821	m529	HAN	Who's going to pay me then?
L542180	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
L542177	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
L542176	u7816	m529	BEN	No, not anymore.
L542175	u7821	m529	HAN	Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
L542174	u7816	m529	BEN	We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
L542173	u7821	m529	HAN	Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
L542172	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
L542171	u7821	m529	HAN	The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
L542170	u7816	m529	BEN	The Empire must have gotten here first.
L542162	u7821	m529	HAN	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
L542161	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, we'll see...
L542090	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
L542089	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
L542433	u7816	m529	BEN	Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
L542432	u7824	m529	LUKE	The Kiber Crystal.
L542254	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm not going alone!
L542253	u7816	m529	BEN	You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
L542252	u7824	m529	LUKE	What about the princess?
L542216	u7824	m529	LUKE	I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
L542215	u7816	m529	BEN	See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
L542214	u7816	m529	BEN	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
L542213	u7824	m529	LUKE	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
L542212	u7816	m529	BEN	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
L542211	u7824	m529	LUKE	I can't see!  How can I fight?
L542192	u7816	m529	BEN	I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
L542191	u7824	m529	LUKE	You mean we should go after her!...
L542190	u7816	m529	BEN	But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
L542165	u7824	m529	LUKE	He can't find Organa Major.
L542164	u7816	m529	BEN	What is it?
L542157	u7816	m529	BEN	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
L542156	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do I do?
L542155	u7816	m529	BEN	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
L542154	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you sure you don't need it?
L542142	u7816	m529	BEN	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
L542141	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you all right?
L542140	u7816	m529	BEN	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
L542139	u7824	m529	LUKE	What's wrong?  What's happening?
L542138	u7816	m529	BEN	These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
L542137	u7824	m529	LUKE	But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
L542136	u7816	m529	BEN	I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
L542135	u7824	m529	LUKE	When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
L542117	u7816	m529	BEN	He's bluffing...
L542116	u7824	m529	LUKE	This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
L542094	u7816	m529	BEN	Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
L542093	u7824	m529	LUKE	We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
L542061	u7816	m529	BEN	There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
L542060	u7824	m529	LUKE	Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
L542059	u7816	m529	BEN	They use the Bogan Force.
L542058	u7824	m529	LUKE	Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
L542057	u7816	m529	BEN	Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
L542056	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's where my father was killed.
L542055	u7816	m529	BEN	I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
L542054	u7824	m529	LUKE	Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
L542053	u7816	m529	BEN	When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
L542052	u7824	m529	LUKE	How can you store an energy field within you?
L542051	u7816	m529	BEN	A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
L542050	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
L542049	u7816	m529	BEN	Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
L542047	u7816	m529	BEN	It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
L542046	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do you mean?
L542045	u7816	m529	BEN	That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
L542044	u7824	m529	LUKE	Could I learn to feel it?
L542043	u7816	m529	BEN	It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
L542042	u7824	m529	LUKE	You mean I generate an energy field?
L542041	u7816	m529	BEN	Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
L542040	u7824	m529	LUKE	My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
L542039	u7816	m529	BEN	You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
L542034	u7816	m529	BEN	Not any more!
L542033	u7824	m529	LUKE	But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
L542032	u7816	m529	BEN	I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
L542031	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
L542030	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
L542028	u7824	m529	LUKE	My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
L542027	u7816	m529	BEN	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
L542026	u7824	m529	LUKE	I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
L542025	u7816	m529	BEN	You could put it that way.
L542024	u7824	m529	LUKE	You saw through me?
L542023	u7816	m529	BEN	I know that.
L542022	u7824	m529	LUKE	I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
L542021	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
L542020	u7816	m529	BEN	I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
L542019	u7824	m529	LUKE	I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
L542018	u7816	m529	BEN	I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
L542016	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
L542015	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
L542014	u7816	m529	BEN	You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
L542013	u7824	m529	LUKE	Who are you anyway?
L542009	u7824	m529	LUKE	Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
L542008	u7816	m529	BEN	Oh, so you're a warrior then?
L542007	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
L542000	u7816	m529	BEN	You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
L541999	u7824	m529	LUKE	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
L541998	u7816	m529	BEN	Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
L541996	u7816	m529	BEN	All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
L541995	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
L541994	u7816	m529	BEN	Good morning!
L541933	u7817	m529	BIGGS	Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
L541932	u7824	m529	LUKE	At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
L541931	u7817	m529	BIGGS	The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
L541930	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
L541929	u7817	m529	BIGGS	I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
L541910	u7824	m529	LUKE	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
L541909	u7817	m529	BIGGS	That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
L541905	u7824	m529	LUKE	You look great!  The uniform and everything!
L541904	u7817	m529	BIGGS	Of course, where you been kid?
L542494	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Forget it, son.
L542493	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir, but I can get him...
L542492	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
L542491	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	What's that?
L542490	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
L542464	u7824	m529	LUKE	I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
L542463	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
L542452	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.
L542451	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
L542450	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
L542449	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Have you been checked out?
L542448	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.
L542447	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	You're Starkiller?
L542233	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
L542232	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
L542230	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	Send one squad up.
L542229	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
L542228	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	I'll make a report later.
L542227	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	Should we alert the Sith Lords?
L542226	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
L542225	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
L542421	u7823	m529	LEIA	I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
L542420	u7821	m529	HAN	What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
L542413	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
L542412	u7823	m529	LEIA	We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
L542411	u7823	m529	LEIA	Did it occur to you they might find us?
L542410	u7821	m529	HAN	I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
L542401	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd better go see how he's doing.
L542400	u7823	m529	LEIA	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
L542399	u7821	m529	HAN	Where are you taking us now anyway?
L542398	u7823	m529	LEIA	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
L542397	u7823	m529	LEIA	The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
L542396	u7821	m529	HAN	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
L542395	u7823	m529	LEIA	When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
L542394	u7821	m529	HAN	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
L542393	u7823	m529	LEIA	All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
L542389	u7821	m529	HAN	Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
L542388	u7823	m529	LEIA	There are only three or four left.
L542386	u7821	m529	HAN	Was this trip really necessary?
L542385	u7823	m529	LEIA	Here come six more... grid two!
L542363	u7823	m529	LEIA	It could be worse...
L542362	u7821	m529	HAN	Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
L542361	u7823	m529	LEIA	Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
L542511	u7824	m529	LUKE	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
L542510	u7821	m529	HAN	I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
L542429	u7821	m529	HAN	I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
L542428	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
L542408	u7821	m529	HAN	Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
L542407	u7824	m529	LUKE	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
L542406	u7821	m529	HAN	I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
L542349	u7824	m529	LUKE	Come back here... Where are you going?
L542348	u7821	m529	HAN	Get to the ship!
L542328	u7821	m529	HAN	Move out of the way!
L542327	u7824	m529	LUKE	It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
L542323	u7824	m529	LUKE	Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
L542322	u7821	m529	HAN	Watch it!  Move back.
L542320	u7821	m529	HAN	No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
L542319	u7824	m529	LUKE	Is he afraid of the water?
L542314	u7821	m529	HAN	Not if this tunnel deadends.
L542313	u7824	m529	LUKE	I think she's going to be all right.
L542308	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
L542307	u7821	m529	HAN	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
L542306	u7824	m529	LUKE	Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
L542282	u7821	m529	HAN	I think I did.
L542281	u7824	m529	LUKE	Why didn't you say so before.
L542280	u7821	m529	HAN	This isn't going to work.
L542268	u7821	m529	HAN	Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
L542267	u7824	m529	LUKE	Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
L542209	u7824	m529	LUKE	I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
L542208	u7821	m529	HAN	You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
L542207	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, I practice a lot...
L542196	u7821	m529	HAN	Don't you believe it.
L542195	u7824	m529	LUKE	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
L542194	u7821	m529	HAN	No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
L542188	u7821	m529	HAN	All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
L542187	u7824	m529	LUKE	Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
L542179	u7821	m529	HAN	Why?
L542178	u7824	m529	LUKE	You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
L542167	u7824	m529	LUKE	What are you saying?
L542166	u7821	m529	HAN	I found it... It's just not there.
L542160	u7821	m529	HAN	Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
L542159	u7824	m529	LUKE	You don't believe in the Force?
L542158	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
L542151	u7821	m529	HAN	It's automatic.
L542150	u7824	m529	LUKE	Who's the pilot?
L542097	u7824	m529	LUKE	We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
L542096	u7821	m529	HAN	You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
L542092	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
L542091	u7821	m529	HAN	Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
L542292	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	Who is this?  What's your operating...
L542291	u7824	m529	LUKE	The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
L542290	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	With four casualties?!
L542289	u7824	m529	LUKE	No need, everything's under control.
L542288	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	We'll send a squad up.
L542287	u7824	m529	LUKE	A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
L542148	u7827	m529	VADER	It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
L542147	u7823	m529	LEIA	No!...
L542146	u7827	m529	VADER	It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
L542145	u7823	m529	LEIA	They'll find its weakness.
L542144	u7827	m529	VADER	The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
L541922	u7827	m529	VADER	It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
L541921	u7823	m529	LEIA	You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
L541920	u7827	m529	VADER	Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
L542426	u7823	m529	LEIA	If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
L542425	u7824	m529	LUKE	I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
L542424	u7823	m529	LEIA	And you?
L542405	u7823	m529	LEIA	He'll be well cared for.
L542404	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
L542333	u7823	m529	LEIA	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
L542332	u7824	m529	LUKE	I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
L542317	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
L542316	u7823	m529	LEIA	What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
L541955	u7825	m529	OWEN	Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
L541954	u7824	m529	LUKE	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
L541953	u7825	m529	OWEN	I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
L541952	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
L541951	u7825	m529	OWEN	You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
L541950	u7824	m529	LUKE	I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
L541949	u7825	m529	OWEN	First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
L542438	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'd consider it an honor.
L542437	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
L542369	u7824	m529	LUKE	Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
L542368	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Are you there, sir?  We're going...
L542367	u7824	m529	LUKE	Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
L542352	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio!  Do you copy?
L542351	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
L542346	u7824	m529	LUKE	Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
L542345	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
L542344	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you safe?
L542343	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
L542342	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
L542341	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I read you sir.
L542340	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio... do you copy?
L542272	u7824	m529	LUKE	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
L542271	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
L542153	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
L542152	u7824	m529	LUKE	Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
L542113	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
L542112	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
L542111	u7824	m529	LUKE	I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
L542005	u7824	m529	LUKE	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
L542004	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
L542003	u7824	m529	LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
L542002	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
L541988	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
L541987	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
L541986	u7824	m529	LUKE	According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
L541969	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
L541968	u7824	m529	LUKE	Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
L541967	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
L541966	u7824	m529	LUKE	You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
L541965	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
L541964	u7824	m529	LUKE	There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
L541963	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
L541962	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
L541961	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
L541960	u7824	m529	LUKE	Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
L544518	u7828	m530	ACE	You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
L544517	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Saddle up, Roughnecks !
L544456	u7828	m530	ACE	Yes, sir !
L544455	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
L544408	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
L544407	u7828	m530	ACE	Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
L544406	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
L544405	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We're the old men, Ace.
L544404	u7828	m530	ACE	We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
L544323	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Not enough, I guess.
L544322	u7828	m530	ACE	Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
L544205	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What about it, Diz ?
L544204	u7828	m530	ACE	No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
L544167	u7828	m530	ACE	Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
L544166	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He was our teacher... He was great.
L544165	u7828	m530	ACE	Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
L544113	u7828	m530	ACE	I didn't see him !
L544112	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
L544085	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Death to all bugs !
L544084	u7828	m530	ACE	Mobile Infantery rules !
L544082	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	YAAAAAAAA !
L544081	u7828	m530	ACE	No, this hurts.
L544051	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What do I want with a scar ?
L544050	u7828	m530	ACE	I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
L543907	u7828	m530	ACE	You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
L543906	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
L543905	u7828	m530	ACE	Whad'ya talkin  about ?
L543904	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's what I deserve.
L543903	u7828	m530	ACE	Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
L543842	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
L543841	u7828	m530	ACE	Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
L543824	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, maybe you better look again.
L543823	u7828	m530	ACE	Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
L543822	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
L543812	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
L543811	u7828	m530	ACE	You rich kids... are all the same !
L543810	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Something... I've got...you don't.
L543809	u7828	m530	ACE	What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
L543801	u7828	m530	ACE	Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
L543800	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What an honor...
L543799	u7828	m530	ACE	You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
L544019	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
L544018	u7829	m530	C.O.	Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
L544017	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
L543934	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir... I guess I do, sir.
L543933	u7829	m530	C.O.	Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
L543930	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
L543929	u7829	m530	C.O.	Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
L543928	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, no, sir.
L543927	u7829	m530	C.O.	Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
L543926	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
L543925	u7829	m530	C.O.	Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
L544506	u7830	m530	CARL	I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
L544505	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You always told me you couldn't do human...
L544393	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
L544392	u7830	m530	CARL	I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
L544391	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
L544390	u7830	m530	CARL	Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
L544389	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
L544388	u7830	m530	CARL	You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
L544385	u7830	m530	CARL	Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
L544384	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
L544383	u7830	m530	CARL	Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
L544378	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
L544377	u7830	m530	CARL	Please continue, Sergeant.
L543706	u7830	m530	CARL	I got Games & Theory.
L543705	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't believe it !
L543558	u7830	m530	CARL	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
L543557	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
L543556	u7830	m530	CARL	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
L543555	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Eight point... no, uh, seven...
L543554	u7830	m530	CARL	Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
L543553	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
L543552	u7830	m530	CARL	Your father will never let you.
L543551	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
L543550	u7830	m530	CARL	Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
L543549	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
L543545	u7830	m530	CARL	I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
L543544	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	How do you make him do that ?
L543538	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	"In addition to ""psychic dolt"" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts."
L543537	u7830	m530	CARL	Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
L543536	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Ace of spades.
L543535	u7830	m530	CARL	Don't think about it... go on instinct.
L543499	u7830	m530	CARL	You got it bad.
L543498	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yeah, but I want Carmen.
L543497	u7830	m530	CARL	Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
L543496	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Did you read her mind ?
L543495	u7830	m530	CARL	Others are waiting.
L543494	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's the hurry ?
L543493	u7830	m530	CARL	You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
L544492	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, no...!
L544491	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
L544490	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, what are you doing ?
L544479	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Is it true ?
L544478	u7843	m530	ZANDER	It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
L544477	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
L544374	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I do.
L544373	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I don't know, Zander.
L544372	u7843	m530	ZANDER	How do you feel about him now ?
L544371	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Yeah.
L544370	u7843	m530	ZANDER	That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
L544369	u7831	m530	CARMEN	A funeral.
L544368	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Where are you going ?
L544162	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You're upset, that's alright.
L544161	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
L544160	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
L544159	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm sorry, Carmen.
L544158	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Excuse me...!
L544157	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Carmen...?
L544155	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
L544154	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
L544153	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
L544152	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Funny...
L544151	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
L544150	u7831	m530	CARMEN	So who's got time to get married ?
L544149	u7843	m530	ZANDER	So ?
L544148	u7831	m530	CARMEN	There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
L544147	u7843	m530	ZANDER	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
L544146	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
L544145	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
L544074	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, please... Let's go !
L544073	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
L544069	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
L544068	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny, wait...
L544065	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
L544064	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
L543967	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It looks like an... asteroid.
L543965	u7831	m530	CARMEN	WHERE IS IT ?
L543962	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
L543961	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
L543958	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You and me, huh ?
L543957	u7843	m530	ZANDER	She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
L543956	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
L543955	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Well, whad'ya know...
L543954	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
L543953	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
L543952	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Hey, check it.
L543951	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
L543950	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
L543949	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Profile's wrong... there.
L543948	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
L543947	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
L543868	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Oh, I see... teamwork.
L543867	u7843	m530	ZANDER	They revoke our flight status.
L543866	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Or...?
L543865	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
L543864	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
L543863	u7843	m530	ZANDER	This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
L543862	u7831	m530	CARMEN	In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
L543859	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
L543858	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
L543856	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Only when I give you an order.
L543855	u7831	m530	CARMEN	"Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you ""sir"" ?"
L543854	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
L543853	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Hey ! What are you doing here ?
L543642	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
L543641	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny, this is Zander.
L543574	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't you have to finish the game ?
L543573	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm all ears.
L543571	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
L543570	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
L543569	u7843	m530	ZANDER	So what are you doing later ?
L543568	u7843	m530	ZANDER	I'm getting better.
L543567	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Are you alright ?
L544482	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
L544481	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Which way ?
L544433	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We've gotta go get her !
L544432	u7831	m530	CARMEN	AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
L544397	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	See you on the bounce !
L544396	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Take care, wilya Johnny ?
L544382	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	How are you, Carl ?
L544381	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
L544367	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I like it. It's kinda...you.
L544366	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
L544365	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What happened to your eye ?
L544364	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
L544363	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	That was just a mix up.
L544362	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
L544361	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
L544360	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
L544359	u7831	m530	CARMEN	...I'm sorry.
L544355	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
L544354	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
L544078	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
L544077	u7831	m530	CARMEN	What's wrong with you ?
L544063	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
L544062	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Should I be ?
L544061	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You don't look very happy to see me.
L544060	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
L544059	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
L544058	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
L544057	u7831	m530	CARMEN	What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
L544056	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What happened to your hair ?
L543899	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
L543898	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Shhhh...!
L543744	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
L543743	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Do you mean it ?
L543742	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Alright, I love you.
L543741	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
L543738	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I love you.
L543737	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
L543736	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna miss you.
L543734	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
L543733	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You talk to Carl ?
L543732	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
L543731	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
L543729	u7831	m530	CARMEN	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
L543728	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You're late.
L543713	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'll go for that.
L543712	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
L543708	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
L543707	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
L543703	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Did you get Starside R&D ?
L543702	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
L543698	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
L543697	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
L543696	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
L543695	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
L543664	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Shhh...
L543663	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I love you, Carmen.
L543661	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You're right. Let's never stop...
L543660	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who cares ?
L543659	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
L543657	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
L543656	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Are you the boy for me ?
L543655	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't even know if you're my girl.
L543654	u7831	m530	CARMEN	He's nothing like you.
L543653	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I can't help it.
L543652	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
L543651	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You two have so much in common.
L543650	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Zander is going for pilot, too.
L543649	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
L543648	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
L543647	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yeah, sure, I guess.
L543646	u7831	m530	CARMEN	He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
L543644	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Good luck at the academy.
L543643	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	None at all... We won.
L543632	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I'll meet you outside.
L543631	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
L543630	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
L543629	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
L543627	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
L543626	u7831	m530	CARMEN	How do I know if this is love ?
L543625	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Isn't it great to be in love ?
L543534	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
L543533	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
L543532	u7831	m530	CARMEN	It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
L543531	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
L543530	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Johnny, my Dad's home today.
L543529	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Carl can wait.
L543528	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I thought you were going to help Carl.
L543527	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Why not ?
L543526	u7831	m530	CARMEN	You can't walk me home.
L543525	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's all I think about anymore.
L543524	u7831	m530	CARMEN	How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
L543523	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
L543522	u7831	m530	CARMEN	I don't want everyone to see.
L543521	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
L543520	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
L543519	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
L543518	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
L543517	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
L543516	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Excuse me...!
L543515	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
L543508	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
L543507	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Eeuch !
L543504	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I have good reflexes.
L543503	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
L543502	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Who ?
L543501	u7831	m530	CARMEN	She's flying starships !
L543491	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Your turn...
L543490	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Good for you.
L544424	u7831	m530	CARMEN	No way, ma'am !
L544423	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
L544421	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Ibanez...LET'S GO !
L544420	u7831	m530	CARMEN	This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
L544399	u7832	m530	DELADIER	He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
L544398	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
L544101	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
L544100	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
L543977	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Thank you, ma'am.
L543976	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
L543861	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Yes, ma'am.
L543860	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
L543852	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Yes, ma'am !
L543851	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
L543850	u7831	m530	CARMEN	Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
L544106	u7843	m530	ZANDER	That's it, we're empty ma'am !
L544105	u7832	m530	DELADIER	This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
L543972	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
L543971	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
L543970	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Where'd it come from ?
L543964	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
L543963	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Report.
L543870	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
L543869	u7832	m530	DELADIER	Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
L544350	u7833	m530	DIZZY	It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
L544349	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
L544348	u7833	m530	DIZZY	I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
L544313	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
L544312	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	All bands.
L544311	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What frequency ?
L544282	u7833	m530	DIZZY	I'm on it !
L544281	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Diz, see what you can do.
L544263	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
L544262	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
L544246	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What ?
L544245	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hey, Diz...
L544240	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Well, excuse me, sir...
L544239	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
L544238	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You used to dance...
L544237	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Nah, I don't do that anymore...
L544236	u7833	m530	DIZZY	C'mon...
L544203	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna need a squad leader.
L544202	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Way to go, amigo !
L544001	u7833	m530	DIZZY	That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
L544000	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's that, Diz ?
L543999	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
L543998	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, see ya.
L543981	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
L543980	u7833	m530	DIZZY	If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
L543979	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
L543978	u7833	m530	DIZZY	It stinks, you goin.
L543882	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You got it.
L543881	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Cover me.
L543880	u7833	m530	DIZZY	High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
L543879	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What ?
L543878	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Flip six, three hole.
L543877	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Man, they're defended... no way in.
L543808	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You saying you didn't ?
L543807	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
L543806	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
L543805	u7833	m530	DIZZY	What's your malfunction, Rico ?
L543804	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No thanks, Diz.
L543803	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
L543624	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You're the best.
L543623	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Guess you gotta go.
L543622	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uh, look, Diz...
L543621	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Sure.
L543620	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
L543619	u7833	m530	DIZZY	How come we never got together ?
L543618	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
L543617	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
L543616	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You still gonna play for Brazil ?
L543614	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Too bad for her if she's not around.
L543613	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
L543612	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
L543581	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Just throw me the ball, Diz.
L543580	u7833	m530	DIZZY	You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
L543579	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What ?
L543566	u7833	m530	DIZZY	Hut... hut !
L543565	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	A lot can happen in three minutes.
L543996	u7838	m530	MOTHER	This time of the year...?
L543995	u7834	m530	FATHER	Looks like rain.
L543994	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Oh, my, what's that ?
L543993	u7834	m530	FATHER	Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
L543992	u7838	m530	MOTHER	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
L543991	u7834	m530	FATHER	Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
L543723	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
L543722	u7834	m530	FATHER	...CUT OFF !
L543610	u7834	m530	FATHER	Teenagers !
L543609	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
L543603	u7834	m530	FATHER	"A year at Harvard and you'll  see this ""Federal Service"" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves ""citizens"" and take airs for the rest of their lives."
L543602	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Good good, then it's all settled.
L543591	u7834	m530	FATHER	Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
L543590	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
L543988	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
L543987	u7834	m530	FATHER	Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
L543720	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
L543719	u7834	m530	FATHER	I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
L543718	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I won't quit !
L543717	u7834	m530	FATHER	You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
L543605	u7834	m530	FATHER	Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
L543604	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
L543601	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
L543600	u7834	m530	FATHER	A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
L543597	u7834	m530	FATHER	Oh, is that how it is ?
L543596	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
L543595	u7834	m530	FATHER	Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
L543594	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
L543593	u7834	m530	FATHER	Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
L543592	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Mr. Rasczak.
L543589	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
L543588	u7834	m530	FATHER	Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
L543586	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
L543585	u7834	m530	FATHER	This came for you today. I presume on your request.
L544270	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	AAAAAAAAAAA !
L544269	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
L544265	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Keep trying, Sergeant.
L544264	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
L544217	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
L544216	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
L544215	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
L544214	u7835	m530	GILLESPIE	Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
L544213	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
L544254	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
L544253	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
L544252	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
L544251	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
L544250	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
L544249	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
L544248	u7836	m530	INTELLIGENCE OFFICER	At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
L544230	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
L544229	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
L544228	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
L544227	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
L544176	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	Good luck. It's not there anymore.
L544175	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
L544171	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I wouldn't mind.
L544170	u7842	m530	SUGAR WATKINS	Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
L544169	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
L544022	u7844	m530	ZIM	Doesn't look like it to me.
L544021	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, yes it is, sir.
L544020	u7844	m530	ZIM	Is that your signature, Rico ?
L543913	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, yes, sir !
L543912	u7844	m530	ZIM	The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
L543887	u7844	m530	ZIM	Don't stand there dumb... GO !
L543886	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Sir, thank you, sir !
L543885	u7844	m530	ZIM	Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
L543685	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
L543684	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
L543683	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Courage, I guess.
L543682	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
L543681	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	No, sir.
L543680	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	Are your parents currently citizens ?
L543679	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Here in Buenos Aires.
L543678	u7839	m530	PSYCH OFFICER	No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
L543990	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
L543989	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
L543985	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
L543984	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hi, mom.
L543983	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
L543725	u7838	m530	MOTHER	I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
L543724	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, yeah, sure...
L543608	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
L543607	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
L543606	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
L543599	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uh, no.
L543598	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
L543584	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Aw, don't get mushy.
L543583	u7838	m530	MOTHER	Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
L544489	u7843	m530	ZANDER	This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
L544488	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Don't be a hero...
L544487	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
L544486	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Alright, we're gonna carry you...
L544485	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Been better, buddy.
L544484	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	How bad are you, pal ?
L544476	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
L544475	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Not a problem.
L544474	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Can you walk ?
L544452	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Move out.
L544451	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Let's go.
L544450	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yeah, that's right.
L544449	u7843	m530	ZANDER	That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
L544448	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I'm gonna save Carmen.
L544447	u7843	m530	ZANDER	What do you think you're doing ?
L544437	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
L544436	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
L544427	u7843	m530	ZANDER	The Rodger Young just burned up...
L544426	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
L544416	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
L544415	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
L544414	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
L544413	u7843	m530	ZANDER	This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
L544412	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
L544353	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
L544352	u7843	m530	ZANDER	On whose authority, Corporal ?
L544072	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
L544071	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
L544070	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
L544067	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
L544066	u7843	m530	ZANDER	Best in the Fleet !
L543576	u7843	m530	ZANDER	You can never be sure.
L543575	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
L544319	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
L544318	u7841	m530	RODGER YOUNG	Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
L544317	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
L544316	u7841	m530	RODGER YOUNG	What is your position ?
L544315	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
L544314	u7841	m530	RODGER YOUNG	This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
L544344	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Give'em hell, sir !
L544343	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
L544342	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	We're not leaving you here, sir !
L544341	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
L544340	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
L544339	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Hit your jets, sir !
L544338	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Cover us, Ace !
L544337	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	AAAAAAAAAAAA !
L544333	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir !
L544332	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Sergeant, secure the boat !
L544308	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	What's going on, Diz ?
L544307	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
L544284	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
L544283	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	What's that look like to you, Rico ?
L544279	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir.
L544278	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
L544260	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Who's that with you ?
L544259	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir !
L544258	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
L544243	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
L544242	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir...
L544241	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
L544233	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Yes, sir.
L544232	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Kill the bitch.
L544231	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	All dead except one, sir.
L544200	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
L544199	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
L544198	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
L543640	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
L543639	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
L543638	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Good for you. Go find out.
L543637	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
L543636	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
L543635	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
L543634	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	What is it, Rico ?
L543633	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Mister Rasczak ?
L543483	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
L543482	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	Uh, I don't know.
L543481	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
L543480	u7837	m530	JOHNNY	The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
L543479	u7840	m530	RASCZAK	You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
L545227	u7849	m531	KIRK	We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
L545226	u7845	m531	ILIA	<U>Answer</U>!
L545225	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our data is being prepared.
L545155	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
L545154	u7849	m531	KIRK	Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
L545152	u7849	m531	KIRK	The information will not be disclosed.
L545151	u7845	m531	ILIA	They have repressed the Creator.
L545150	u7849	m531	KIRK	Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
L545149	u7845	m531	ILIA	Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
L545138	u7845	m531	ILIA	KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
L545137	u7849	m531	KIRK	Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
L545136	u7845	m531	ILIA	Disclose the information.
L545124	u7845	m531	ILIA	You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
L545123	u7849	m531	KIRK	The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
L545122	u7845	m531	ILIA	The Creator has not answered.
L545121	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Why</U>?!
L545120	u7845	m531	ILIA	The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
L545119	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Why</U>...?!
L544968	u7845	m531	ILIA	You may proceede.
L544967	u7849	m531	KIRK	The examination is a normal function.
L544963	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
L544962	u7849	m531	KIRK	Who is V'ger?
L544961	u7845	m531	ILIA	The Creator is that which created V'ger.
L544957	u7845	m531	ILIA	To join with him.
L544956	u7849	m531	KIRK	Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
L544955	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
L544954	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
L544952	u7845	m531	ILIA	That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
L544951	u7849	m531	KIRK	Where is Lt. Ilia?
L544949	u7849	m531	KIRK	Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
L544948	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger is that which programmed me.
L544947	u7849	m531	KIRK	Who is...'V'ger'...?
L545236	u7845	m531	ILIA	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
L545235	u7847	m531	DECKER	And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
L545108	u7847	m531	DECKER	It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
L545107	u7845	m531	ILIA	'To learn all that is learnable.'
L545106	u7847	m531	DECKER	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
L545105	u7845	m531	ILIA	As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
L545093	u7845	m531	ILIA	To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
L545092	u7847	m531	DECKER	To join, and become One with the Creator?
L545091	u7845	m531	ILIA	By the Creator.
L545090	u7847	m531	DECKER	A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
L545038	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is how V'ger will survive.
L545037	u7847	m531	DECKER	You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
L545035	u7845	m531	ILIA	The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
L545034	u7847	m531	DECKER	Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
L545012	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is logical. You may procede.
L545011	u7847	m531	DECKER	Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
L545010	u7845	m531	ILIA	When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
L545009	u7847	m531	DECKER	What does that mean?
L545008	u7845	m531	ILIA	More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
L545007	u7847	m531	DECKER	Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
L545006	u7845	m531	ILIA	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
L545005	u7847	m531	DECKER	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
L545004	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
L545003	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes.
L545002	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
L545001	u7847	m531	DECKER	The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
L545203	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
L545202	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
L545170	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering...
L545169	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
L545168	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
L545017	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
L545016	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
L544944	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
L544943	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
L544763	u7849	m531	KIRK	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
L544762	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
L544682	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Departure angle.
L544681	u7849	m531	KIRK	Departure angle on viewer.
L545253	u7849	m531	KIRK	Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
L545252	u7847	m531	DECKER	And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
L545251	u7849	m531	KIRK	Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
L545250	u7847	m531	DECKER	The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
L545221	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain... I'd like to go along...
L545220	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
L545209	u7849	m531	KIRK	No!
L545208	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
L545207	u7849	m531	KIRK	    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
L545167	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
L545166	u7849	m531	KIRK	Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
L545163	u7849	m531	KIRK	The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
L545162	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, what's the next move?
L544923	u7849	m531	KIRK	They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
L544922	u7847	m531	DECKER	Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
L544909	u7849	m531	KIRK	Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
L544908	u7847	m531	DECKER	The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
L544901	u7849	m531	KIRK	It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
L544900	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's taken control of the computer...!
L544899	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Computer off</U>!
L544868	u7847	m531	DECKER	You asked my opinion, sir.
L544867	u7849	m531	KIRK	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
L544866	u7847	m531	DECKER	That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
L544865	u7849	m531	KIRK	That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
L544864	u7847	m531	DECKER	I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
L544819	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr Decker....
L544818	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
L544815	u7849	m531	KIRK	No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
L544814	u7847	m531	DECKER	Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
L544774	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
L544773	u7847	m531	DECKER	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
L544772	u7849	m531	KIRK	If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
L544748	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes, sir, I'll do that.
L544747	u7849	m531	KIRK	I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
L544746	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
L544745	u7849	m531	KIRK	Granted.
L544744	u7847	m531	DECKER	Permission to speak freely, sir?
L544743	u7849	m531	KIRK	Stop competing with me, Decker!
L544742	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm aware of that, sir.
L544741	u7849	m531	KIRK	You saved the ship.
L544740	u7847	m531	DECKER	Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
L544739	u7849	m531	KIRK	Then you acted properly, of course.
L544738	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
L544737	u7849	m531	KIRK	Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
L544692	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
L544691	u7847	m531	DECKER	... but I still recommend further simulation study.
L544690	u7847	m531	DECKER	Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
L544689	u7849	m531	KIRK	Programming ready?
L544618	u7849	m531	KIRK	You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
L544617	u7847	m531	DECKER	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
L544616	u7849	m531	KIRK	We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
L544599	u7847	m531	DECKER	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
L544598	u7849	m531	KIRK	That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
L544596	u7847	m531	DECKER	Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
L544595	u7849	m531	KIRK	My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
L544594	u7847	m531	DECKER	May I ask Why?
L544593	u7849	m531	KIRK	Yes.
L544592	u7847	m531	DECKER	-- You, personally, are assuming command?
L544591	u7849	m531	KIRK	You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
L544590	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
L544589	u7847	m531	DECKER	You are what...?
L544588	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
L545255	u7847	m531	DECKER	You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
L545254	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
L545217	u7847	m531	DECKER	   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
L545216	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
L545193	u7853	m531	SPOCK	V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
L545192	u7847	m531	DECKER	Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
L545161	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A tractor beam...
L545160	u7847	m531	DECKER	Forward motion, Captain...!
L545126	u7847	m531	DECKER	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
L545125	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
L544980	u7847	m531	DECKER	That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
L544979	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
L544975	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
L544974	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
L544973	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
L544903	u7853	m531	SPOCK	This served the purpose.
L544902	u7847	m531	DECKER	We could have cut it off at the main computer...
L544858	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
L544857	u7847	m531	DECKER	They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
L544754	u7848	m531	ILIA	No.
L544753	u7847	m531	DECKER	If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
L544752	u7848	m531	ILIA	That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
L544751	u7847	m531	DECKER	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
L544750	u7848	m531	ILIA	Was he difficult?
L544712	u7847	m531	DECKER	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
L544711	u7848	m531	ILIA	Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
L544709	u7848	m531	ILIA	Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
L544708	u7847	m531	DECKER	Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
L544656	u7848	m531	ILIA	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
L544655	u7847	m531	DECKER	I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
L544642	u7848	m531	ILIA	Decker....!
L544641	u7847	m531	DECKER	Hello, Ilia.
L544870	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer, standard ahead.
L544869	u7848	m531	ILIA	Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
L544861	u7849	m531	KIRK	Opinion, Mister. Spock?
L544860	u7848	m531	ILIA	Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
L544846	u7848	m531	ILIA	Ten seconds....
L544845	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
L544844	u7848	m531	ILIA	Impact in fifteen seconds...
L544843	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Spock?
L544824	u7849	m531	KIRK	I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
L544823	u7848	m531	ILIA	Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
L544715	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
L544714	u7848	m531	ILIA	Twelve seconds...!
L544713	u7849	m531	KIRK	Time to impact...?
L544648	u7848	m531	ILIA	My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
L544647	u7849	m531	KIRK	And in you, too, Lieutenant.
L544645	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our Exec and Science Officer...
L544644	u7848	m531	ILIA	'Commander' Decker?
L544640	u7849	m531	KIRK	Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
L544639	u7848	m531	ILIA	Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
L545142	u7849	m531	KIRK	That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
L545141	u7854	m531	SULU	Clear the bridge, Captain...?
L544936	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station keeping...
L544935	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station...!
L544932	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters ahead, one third.
L544931	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
L544930	u7854	m531	SULU	Viewer ahead, sir.
L544929	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer ahead.
L544890	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold relative position here...
L544889	u7854	m531	SULU	One hundred kilometers...
L544888	u7849	m531	KIRK	Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
L544887	u7854	m531	SULU	We're already two settings below that, sir.
L544886	u7849	m531	KIRK	Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
L544872	u7854	m531	SULU	Aye, sir.
L544871	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
L544700	u7854	m531	SULU	Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
L544699	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
L544676	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
L544675	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station.
L544674	u7854	m531	SULU	Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
L544673	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
L544575	u7854	m531	SULU	He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
L544574	u7849	m531	KIRK	I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
L544608	u7849	m531	KIRK	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
L544607	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're losing the pattern...!
L544562	u7849	m531	KIRK	Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
L544561	u7850	m531	SCOTT	The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
L544558	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
L544557	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
L544556	u7849	m531	KIRK	See that it is.  Take me over, please.
L544555	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
L544554	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
L544553	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
L545260	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
L545259	u7849	m531	KIRK	... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
L545258	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
L545257	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
L545238	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
L545237	u7849	m531	KIRK	There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
L545224	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
L545223	u7849	m531	KIRK	V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
L545206	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
L545205	u7849	m531	KIRK	The point... 
L545204	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
L545191	u7849	m531	KIRK	There is no alternative.
L545190	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
L545187	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
L545186	u7849	m531	KIRK	Not for us?
L545158	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Precisely.
L545157	u7849	m531	KIRK	The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
L545131	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
L545130	u7849	m531	KIRK	Child...!?
L545113	u7849	m531	KIRK	High mag, Mr. Sulu!
L545112	u7853	m531	SPOCK	These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
L545078	u7853	m531	SPOCK	'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
L545077	u7849	m531	KIRK	What answers?
L545076	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
L545075	u7849	m531	KIRK	What should you have known?
L545069	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
L545068	u7849	m531	KIRK	Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
L545059	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
L545058	u7849	m531	KIRK	If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
L545057	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
L545056	u7849	m531	KIRK	Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
L545054	u7853	m531	SPOCK	New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
L545053	u7849	m531	KIRK	And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
L545052	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
L545050	u7849	m531	KIRK	Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
L545049	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am seeking answers, Captain.
L545048	u7849	m531	KIRK	Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
L544988	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
L544987	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock? Concerned about his chances?
L544978	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
L544977	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
L544976	u7849	m531	KIRK	They had a pattern to follow...
L544940	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
L544939	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
L544915	u7849	m531	KIRK	Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
L544914	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
L544911	u7849	m531	KIRK	Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
L544910	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
L544881	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
L544880	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
L544874	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
L544873	u7849	m531	KIRK	No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
L544863	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... ?
L544862	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Recommend we proceede, Captain.
L544856	u7849	m531	KIRK	But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
L544855	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
L544854	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our... 'insignificance'?
L544853	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
L544850	u7849	m531	KIRK	Any reply from them?
L544849	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
L544827	u7849	m531	KIRK	Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
L544826	u7853	m531	SPOCK	They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
L544821	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
L544820	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
L544810	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
L544809	u7849	m531	KIRK	Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
L544801	u7849	m531	KIRK	I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
L544800	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
L544799	u7849	m531	KIRK	Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
L544798	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
L544797	u7849	m531	KIRK	And whatever you sensed out here....
L544796	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I still contain fragments of my human half.
L544793	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
L544792	u7849	m531	KIRK	Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
L544791	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
L544790	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
L544789	u7849	m531	KIRK	I want him here.  Sit down!
L544788	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
L544787	u7849	m531	KIRK	Sit down, please.
L544786	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Reporting as ordered, Captain.
L544552	u7849	m531	KIRK	I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
L544551	u7852	m531	SONAK	To you, sir?
L544550	u7849	m531	KIRK	Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
L544549	u7852	m531	SONAK	Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
L544548	u7849	m531	KIRK	Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
L544547	u7852	m531	SONAK	Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
L544546	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't you on board?
L544545	u7852	m531	SONAK	Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
L544544	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
L545201	u7849	m531	KIRK	Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
L545200	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	We're ready, sir.
L545199	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
L544732	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
L544731	u7849	m531	KIRK	That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
L544730	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
L544729	u7849	m531	KIRK	Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
L544694	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
L544693	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
L545182	u7854	m531	SULU	Tractor beam remains constant...
L545181	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
L545115	u7855	m531	UHURA	<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
L545114	u7854	m531	SULU	The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
L545015	u7854	m531	SULU	Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
L545014	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
L544706	u7855	m531	UHURA	Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
L544705	u7854	m531	SULU	Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
L544670	u7854	m531	SULU	Helm ready, sir.
L544669	u7855	m531	UHURA	Dock control reports ready, sir.
L544634	u7854	m531	SULU	Dock signals clear, Captain.
L544633	u7855	m531	UHURA	Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
L551557	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Times up!
L551556	u7902	m535	ALONZO	Well, I-I hope that--that--
L551555	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
L551554	u7902	m535	ALONZO	Y-yes--
L551553	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
L551552	u7902	m535	ALONZO	Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
L551551	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
L551550	u7902	m535	ALONZO	Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
L551549	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
L551770	u7903	m535	BURNS	I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
L551769	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Is he with the girl?
L551767	u7903	m535	BURNS	There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
L551766	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Well get someone down there!
L551765	u7903	m535	BURNS	We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
L551667	u7903	m535	BURNS	Listen man, I don't need this shit--
L551666	u7908	m535	RICHTER	"I now understand the expression ""you get what you pay for!"" A bunch of chumps!"
L551665	u7903	m535	BURNS	I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
L552040	u7905	m535	FILMORE	I guess not Cooper...
L552039	u7904	m535	COOPER	Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
L552038	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Well Cooper...
L552037	u7904	m535	COOPER	Well Filmore--
L551787	u7904	m535	COOPER	Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
L551786	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
L551781	u7905	m535	FILMORE	You're talking about committing suicide!
L551780	u7904	m535	COOPER	Because I'll be firing at them.
L551779	u7904	m535	COOPER	They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
L551778	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What are you talking about?
L551777	u7904	m535	COOPER	I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
L551773	u7904	m535	COOPER	There's the fence...
L551772	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Now what?
L551743	u7904	m535	COOPER	Used to Filmore, used to.
L551742	u7905	m535	FILMORE	You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
L551740	u7904	m535	COOPER	By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
L551739	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What happened?
L551738	u7904	m535	COOPER	I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
L551734	u7904	m535	COOPER	Yeah?...
L551733	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Cooper...
L551717	u7904	m535	COOPER	No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
L551716	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
L551715	u7904	m535	COOPER	What do you think?
L551714	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What's that supposed to mean?
L551713	u7904	m535	COOPER	After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
L551712	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What do you mean?
L551711	u7904	m535	COOPER	You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
L551710	u7905	m535	FILMORE	He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
L551709	u7905	m535	FILMORE	I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
L551708	u7904	m535	COOPER	Forget about it.
L551651	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What happened!
L551650	u7904	m535	COOPER	Let's move it we got company!
L551647	u7904	m535	COOPER	Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
L551646	u7905	m535	FILMORE	We don't have time!
L551645	u7904	m535	COOPER	--be prepared.
L551607	u7904	m535	COOPER	We're outta here--
L551606	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What now?
L551580	u7904	m535	COOPER	Who's got matches?
L551579	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What are we going to do!
L551489	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
L551488	u7904	m535	COOPER	Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
L551486	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
L551485	u7904	m535	COOPER	I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
L551484	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
L551464	u7905	m535	FILMORE	If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
L551463	u7904	m535	COOPER	I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
L551462	u7905	m535	FILMORE	What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
L551461	u7904	m535	COOPER	I said I'll lead.
L551460	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Why? Are we going dancing?
L551459	u7904	m535	COOPER	I'll lead.
L551747	u7907	m535	OLO	The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
L551746	u7904	m535	COOPER	Where does it lead?
L551745	u7907	m535	OLO	That's it!  Up ahead!
L551706	u7904	m535	COOPER	We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
L551705	u7907	m535	OLO	It's nothing to worry about.
L551704	u7904	m535	COOPER	How's the arm?
L551641	u7904	m535	COOPER	Good...
L551640	u7907	m535	OLO	I don't see why they wouldn't be.
L551639	u7904	m535	COOPER	Are the labs in operation?
L551638	u7907	m535	OLO	We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
L551637	u7904	m535	COOPER	How well do you know this place?
L551582	u7904	m535	COOPER	Even better.
L551581	u7907	m535	OLO	I have a lighter!
L551980	u7905	m535	FILMORE	I said I don't want any, goddammit!
L551979	u7908	m535	RICHTER	I insist...
L551978	u7905	m535	FILMORE	I don't want any...
L551977	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Come on, drink up.
L551974	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Shut up!
L551973	u7908	m535	RICHTER	You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
L551964	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Yes, you should.
L551963	u7905	m535	FILMORE	I suppose...you think I should thank you.
L551910	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Like where--in your dreams?
L551909	u7908	m535	RICHTER	I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
L551908	u7908	m535	RICHTER	It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
L551907	u7905	m535	FILMORE	You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
L551833	u7908	m535	RICHTER	You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
L551832	u7905	m535	FILMORE	You're going to pay for this...
L551831	u7908	m535	RICHTER	I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
L551816	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
L551815	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Go fuck yourself...
L551528	u7908	m535	RICHTER	I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
L551527	u7905	m535	FILMORE	Are you going to kill us?
L551526	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Enjoying the tour so far?
L551960	u7906	m535	MYERS	You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
L551959	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	She's as good as gone...
L551958	u7906	m535	MYERS	Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
L551880	u7906	m535	MYERS	He's in there...
L551879	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	What about Cooper--where is he?
L551689	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
L551688	u7906	m535	MYERS	Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
L551624	u7906	m535	MYERS	We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
L551623	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	Good.
L551622	u7906	m535	MYERS	We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
L551621	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	Well?
L551561	u7906	m535	MYERS	The transmission is an hour old...
L551560	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	She's still alive.
L551559	u7906	m535	MYERS	Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
L551876	u7912	m535	WHITE	They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
L551875	u7906	m535	MYERS	What!
L551874	u7912	m535	WHITE	He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
L551695	u7906	m535	MYERS	How much do they have?
L551694	u7912	m535	WHITE	Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
L551693	u7906	m535	MYERS	What the hell is it, anyhow?
L551692	u7912	m535	WHITE	Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
L551691	u7906	m535	MYERS	I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
L551690	u7912	m535	WHITE	Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
L551662	u7912	m535	WHITE	Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
L551661	u7906	m535	MYERS	Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
L551660	u7912	m535	WHITE	I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
L551659	u7906	m535	MYERS	What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
L551658	u7912	m535	WHITE	What do you mean?
L551657	u7906	m535	MYERS	So, what are we looking at White?
L551627	u7912	m535	WHITE	I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
L551626	u7906	m535	MYERS	The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
L551625	u7912	m535	WHITE	And what exactly do they intend to do?
L551574	u7906	m535	MYERS	I'll let the senator tell you.
L551573	u7912	m535	WHITE	Who's Ryan Cooper?
L551569	u7906	m535	MYERS	I'm sure you'll figure it out.
L551568	u7912	m535	WHITE	And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
L551565	u7912	m535	WHITE	Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
L551564	u7906	m535	MYERS	This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
L551763	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Excellent.
L551762	u7910	m535	SMITTY	We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
L551761	u7908	m535	RICHTER	What's happening at the waterfront?
L551726	u7910	m535	SMITTY	You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
L551725	u7908	m535	RICHTER	I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
L551724	u7910	m535	SMITTY	What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
L551723	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Where the hell could they have gone!
L551671	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Excellent...excellent!
L551670	u7910	m535	SMITTY	KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
L551598	u7910	m535	SMITTY	Richter-we got a problem!
L551597	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
L551591	u7910	m535	SMITTY	I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
L551590	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
L551589	u7910	m535	SMITTY	I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
L551588	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
L551534	u7910	m535	SMITTY	We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
L551533	u7908	m535	RICHTER	How goes the roll call?
L551995	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
L551994	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Get your men to do it!
L551993	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	We can't--it's power driven!
L551992	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Drop the anchor!
L551991	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	If I don't get power up we are!
L551990	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Are we adrift--
L551898	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
L551897	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Dissent?
L551896	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
L551895	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
L551894	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
L551892	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
L551891	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
L551890	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Agreed--let's move it.
L551889	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	I say we head out.
L551888	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Good.
L551887	u7911	m535	STOCKTON	Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
L551886	u7908	m535	RICHTER	Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
L551700	u7912	m535	WHITE	There's enough in one vial...
L551699	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	What does that mean?
L551698	u7912	m535	WHITE	They must have got their hands on a test vial!
L551697	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	How much of this shit do they have, White!!
L551696	u7912	m535	WHITE	Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
L551687	u7912	m535	WHITE	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
L551686	u7909	m535	SEN. FILMORE	Just what the hell is he talking about?
L555709	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
L555708	u7967	m540	ALURA	But what will happen?
L555707	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
L555706	u7967	m540	ALURA	But the Power Source, Zaltar.
L555702	u7967	m540	ALURA	How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
L555701	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
L555699	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
L555698	u7967	m540	ALURA	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
L555697	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
L555694	u7967	m540	ALURA	But where?
L555693	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
L556197	u7978	m540	SELENA	What do you mean we?
L556196	u7968	m540	BIANCA	And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
L556195	u7978	m540	SELENA	At last. Ultimate Power.
L556140	u7978	m540	SELENA	That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
L556139	u7968	m540	BIANCA	She didn't take it from you, did she?
L556138	u7978	m540	SELENA	I don't feel like it right now.
L556136	u7978	m540	SELENA	Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
L556135	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
L556086	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
L556085	u7978	m540	SELENA	No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
L556084	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Home?
L555971	u7978	m540	SELENA	Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
L555970	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Whatever you say.
L555969	u7978	m540	SELENA	I think I'd better keep it.
L555968	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
L555967	u7978	m540	SELENA	Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
L555965	u7968	m540	BIANCA	The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
L555964	u7978	m540	SELENA	What do I do?  I don't know her name.
L555962	u7968	m540	BIANCA	That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
L555961	u7978	m540	SELENA	I've been saving it. For the right moment.
L555960	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
L555959	u7978	m540	SELENA	Am I? Still?
L555958	u7968	m540	BIANCA	You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
L555957	u7978	m540	SELENA	That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
L555956	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Eliminate her.
L555955	u7978	m540	SELENA	Why did she have to show up now?
L555938	u7978	m540	SELENA	No, a super girl.
L555937	u7968	m540	BIANCA	A Storm Dragon?
L555936	u7978	m540	SELENA	It's what we were warned about.
L555935	u7968	m540	BIANCA	I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
L555863	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Have fun.
L555862	u7978	m540	SELENA	He will be. In about five minutes.
L555861	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Is he your entertainment for tonight?
L555839	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Sorry, mistress.
L555838	u7978	m540	SELENA	Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
L555837	u7968	m540	BIANCA	And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
L555836	u7978	m540	SELENA	We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
L555835	u7978	m540	SELENA	Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
L555834	u7968	m540	BIANCA	But which one?
L555833	u7978	m540	SELENA	It must be the girls. One of the girls.
L555832	u7968	m540	BIANCA	Softball.
L555831	u7978	m540	SELENA	Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
L555830	u7968	m540	BIANCA	The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
L555829	u7978	m540	SELENA	What does it mean?
L555828	u7978	m540	SELENA	The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
L555827	u7968	m540	BIANCA	What is it?
L555826	u7978	m540	SELENA	I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
L555778	u7978	m540	SELENA	There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
L555777	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	Maybe it was just an accident.
L555776	u7978	m540	SELENA	It's a warning, that's for sure.
L555775	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	Is this Nigel's doing?
L555753	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
L555752	u7978	m540	SELENA	I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
L555751	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	Western Europe.
L555750	u7978	m540	SELENA	What do you want?
L555749	u7969	m540	ELDERLY MAN	I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
L556429	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Do you want to come to Argo City?
L556428	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She's right. They'll string her up.
L556426	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I'll come back as soon as I can.
L556425	u7970	m540	ETHAN	No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
L556406	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Turn it against her.
L556405	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	How do I fight it?
L556404	u7970	m540	ETHAN	It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
L556397	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She has hostages.
L556396	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
L556228	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Yes.
L556227	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	And you can see how you feel about me, right?
L556226	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
L556225	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What?
L556224	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Before you go...
L556223	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
L556222	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Wait. Don't leave me.
L556221	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
L556220	u7970	m540	ETHAN	In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
L556219	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
L556218	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
L556217	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
L556216	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She'll forget about us eventually.
L556215	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
L556214	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
L556213	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	"Are you asking me for a ""date""?"
L556212	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
L556211	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
L556210	u7970	m540	ETHAN	But what if---it wasn't real?
L556209	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I don't see why not.
L556208	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You think so?
L556206	u7970	m540	ETHAN	And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
L556205	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	And now?
L556204	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
L556203	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Miss what?
L556202	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
L556201	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It seemed that way to me.
L556200	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'm not mad at you.
L556199	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Hello. Are you still mad at me?
L556198	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Hi.
L556193	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But I don't understand.
L556192	u7970	m540	ETHAN	That makes it worse.
L556191	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I sort of like what you said.
L556190	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
L556189	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But why?
L556188	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Away. From you.
L556185	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Like turning off a light.
L556184	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Just like that?
L556183	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't love you any more.
L556182	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
L556181	u7970	m540	ETHAN	She said it wouldn't last.
L556152	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
L556151	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
L556149	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
L556148	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
L556147	u7970	m540	ETHAN	It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
L556146	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
L556123	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Terrific.
L556122	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Is this how?
L556121	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Well...I guess one is all right.
L556120	u7970	m540	ETHAN	If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
L556119	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
L556118	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You're not afraid are you?
L556117	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	No.
L556116	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Let me kiss you.
L556115	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What's that?
L556114	u7970	m540	ETHAN	There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
L556112	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What do you feel about me?
L556111	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
L556110	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You don't like me? You hate me?
L556109	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	All this talk about love, it's silly.
L556108	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
L556107	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	We're from different worlds.
L556106	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why not ?
L556105	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	We can't do that.
L556104	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
L556103	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
L556102	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
L556101	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Tell me where I can find her.
L556100	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Let's talk about us, not her.
L556099	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
L556098	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
L556097	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Come on, let's ride.
L556096	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
L556095	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'm sorry, I don't understand.
L556094	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
L556093	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Where Superman's from? Krypton?
L556092	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Yes. It reminds me of home.
L556091	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Like it?
L556090	u7970	m540	ETHAN	They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
L556089	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
L556088	u7970	m540	ETHAN	This is my favourite place in the city.
L556083	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
L556082	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	We have to have a long talk about all this.
L556081	u7970	m540	ETHAN	My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
L556080	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You love me?
L556079	u7970	m540	ETHAN	That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
L556078	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Who didn't?
L556077	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You're alive! She didn't kill you!
L555944	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
L555943	u7970	m540	ETHAN	When can I see, you again ?
L555942	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I have to.
L555941	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Don't leave me.
L555933	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Later.
L555932	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Let me out. I have to talk to you.
L555931	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I'm taking you to the hospital.
L555930	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What's happening?
L555929	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's for your own protection.
L555928	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Wait...don't leave me in here...
L556353	u7975	m540	LUCY	Well thanks a pile, fella.
L556352	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I did.
L556351	u7975	m540	LUCY	Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
L556322	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'll mention it upstairs.
L556321	u7975	m540	LUCY	Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
L556320	u7970	m540	ETHAN	A little.
L556317	u7975	m540	LUCY	Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
L556316	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Hmmm?
L556315	u7975	m540	LUCY	Hey! Ethan!
L556366	u7978	m540	SELENA	That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
L556365	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why the empty cage?
L556363	u7978	m540	SELENA	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
L556362	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Well...I guess I can't.
L556361	u7978	m540	SELENA	You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
L556358	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Supergirl?
L556357	u7978	m540	SELENA	You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
L556356	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't know. You seem afraid.
L556355	u7978	m540	SELENA	Guess! Go on.
L556299	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Yeah.
L556298	u7978	m540	SELENA	They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
L556242	u7978	m540	SELENA	Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
L556241	u7970	m540	ETHAN	You vicious--
L556240	u7978	m540	SELENA	You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
L556239	u7978	m540	SELENA	Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
L556238	u7970	m540	ETHAN	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
L556237	u7978	m540	SELENA	I could force you.
L556236	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
L556037	u7978	m540	SELENA	I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
L556036	u7970	m540	ETHAN	No!
L556035	u7978	m540	SELENA	Come back to my house. My car's outside.
L556034	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I don't want your help.
L556033	u7978	m540	SELENA	This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
L556026	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Nurse! Help !
L556025	u7978	m540	SELENA	Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
L556024	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Nurse!
L556023	u7978	m540	SELENA	You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
L556022	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Nurse! Nurse!
L556020	u7978	m540	SELENA	Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
L556019	u7970	m540	ETHAN	But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
L556018	u7978	m540	SELENA	Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
L556016	u7978	m540	SELENA	It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
L556015	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Why should I believe you?
L556014	u7978	m540	SELENA	"This ""love"" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion."
L556013	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I know it.
L556012	u7978	m540	SELENA	And you think you're in love.
L556011	u7970	m540	ETHAN	They think I have a concussion.
L556010	u7978	m540	SELENA	What an adorable hat.
L556009	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Oh no, not you again.
L555882	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I'll drink to that.
L555881	u7978	m540	SELENA	To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
L555880	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Well, just one.
L555879	u7978	m540	SELENA	A passionfruit smoothee.
L555878	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What is it?
L555871	u7978	m540	SELENA	Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
L555870	u7970	m540	ETHAN	What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
L555869	u7978	m540	SELENA	I bet they do.
L555868	u7970	m540	ETHAN	I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
L555867	u7978	m540	SELENA	You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
L555866	u7978	m540	SELENA	Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
L555865	u7970	m540	ETHAN	Well, there's several ways to go .
L555864	u7978	m540	SELENA	Finished your estimate?
L555724	u7978	m540	SELENA	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
L555723	u7971	m540	GEORGE	What about my proposal?
L555722	u7978	m540	SELENA	I've got things to do.
L555721	u7971	m540	GEORGE	Hey, where you going?
L555717	u7978	m540	SELENA	George---I thought you'd never ask.
L555716	u7971	m540	GEORGE	Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
L555715	u7978	m540	SELENA	Why George, are you proposing?
L555714	u7971	m540	GEORGE	Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
L555713	u7978	m540	SELENA	Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
L555712	u7971	m540	GEORGE	You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
L556065	u7972	m540	JIMMY	The scoop of the year!
L556064	u7974	m540	LINDA	Yes.
L556063	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
L556062	u7974	m540	LINDA	Someone's chasing him.
L556053	u7972	m540	JIMMY	It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
L556052	u7974	m540	LINDA	Oh, no thanks.
L556051	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Can I give you a lift?
L556046	u7974	m540	LINDA	Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
L556045	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
L556007	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
L556006	u7974	m540	LINDA	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
L556005	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
L555999	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Can I quote you?
L555998	u7974	m540	LINDA	I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
L555995	u7972	m540	JIMMY	How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
L555994	u7974	m540	LINDA	Theories?
L555993	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Do you have any theories about last night?
L555990	u7974	m540	LINDA	Nice to meet you.
L555989	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
L556376	u7975	m540	LUCY	You're supposed to guess.
L556375	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Why didn't you tell me?
L556374	u7975	m540	LUCY	You bet your ass.
L556373	u7972	m540	JIMMY	You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
L556372	u7975	m540	LUCY	Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
L556371	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
L556314	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
L556313	u7975	m540	LUCY	I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
L556312	u7972	m540	JIMMY	I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
L556310	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
L556309	u7975	m540	LUCY	I can't help it if men notice me.
L556308	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Did anybody notice you?
L556307	u7975	m540	LUCY	I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
L556306	u7972	m540	JIMMY	How do you know?
L556305	u7975	m540	LUCY	I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
L556001	u7972	m540	JIMMY	Oh, sure.
L556000	u7975	m540	LUCY	Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
L555997	u7972	m540	JIMMY	-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
L555996	u7975	m540	LUCY	Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
L555745	u7973	m540	KARA	As brave as my father. As wise.
L555744	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
L555735	u7973	m540	KARA	Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
L555734	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	Superman will return it.
L555731	u7973	m540	KARA	I allowed it to escape the City.
L555730	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
L555729	u7973	m540	KARA	It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
L555728	u7981	m540	ZOR-EL	But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
L555727	u7973	m540	KARA	I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
L555705	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
L555704	u7973	m540	KARA	I'm sorry... I didn't know.
L555685	u7973	m540	KARA	Can you create life?
L555684	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	You see, a tree is a living thing.
L555682	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
L555681	u7973	m540	KARA	I don't understand.
L555680	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
L555679	u7973	m540	KARA	Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
L555678	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
L555677	u7973	m540	KARA	Where is Earth?
L555676	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
L555675	u7973	m540	KARA	What's a tree?
L555674	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's going to be a tree, I think.
L555673	u7973	m540	KARA	What are you making:
L556049	u7975	m540	LUCY	Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
L556048	u7974	m540	LINDA	I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
L556047	u7975	m540	LUCY	You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
L556004	u7975	m540	LUCY	Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
L556003	u7974	m540	LINDA	He's nice.
L556002	u7975	m540	LUCY	Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
L555992	u7975	m540	LUCY	Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
L555991	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
L555921	u7975	m540	LUCY	Somebody's gotta do something!!
L555920	u7974	m540	LINDA	Lucy; come back!
L555917	u7975	m540	LUCY	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
L555916	u7974	m540	LINDA	Why is he acting so strangely?
L555913	u7975	m540	LUCY	Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
L555912	u7974	m540	LINDA	It doesn't seem right.
L555911	u7975	m540	LUCY	Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
L555910	u7974	m540	LINDA	Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
L555909	u7975	m540	LUCY	Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
L555852	u7975	m540	LUCY	You sure?
L555851	u7974	m540	LINDA	No thanks. You go on.
L555846	u7974	m540	LINDA	It was just a trim.
L555845	u7975	m540	LUCY	Your hair looks the same.
L555815	u7975	m540	LUCY	She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
L555814	u7974	m540	LINDA	But what for?
L555813	u7975	m540	LUCY	Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
L555812	u7974	m540	LINDA	Must've been a defective puck.
L555811	u7975	m540	LUCY	How'd you do that?
L555810	u7975	m540	LUCY	She's a beast.
L555809	u7974	m540	LINDA	She did that deliberately.
L555807	u7974	m540	LINDA	Thank you. You're very kind.
L555806	u7975	m540	LUCY	Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
L555805	u7974	m540	LINDA	My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
L555804	u7975	m540	LUCY	You're not...an orphan are you?
L555803	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'd rather not talk about it.
L555802	u7975	m540	LUCY	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
L555801	u7974	m540	LINDA	I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
L555800	u7975	m540	LUCY	This is all your clothes?
L555799	u7974	m540	LINDA	There isn't any.
L555798	u7975	m540	LUCY	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
L555797	u7974	m540	LINDA	I can do that.
L555903	u7974	m540	LINDA	Sure. Mate in five moves.
L555902	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	What? Me?
L555901	u7974	m540	LINDA	Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
L555860	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'd love to.
L555859	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
L555858	u7974	m540	LINDA	No, MR. Danvers.
L555857	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	No plans for the weekend, Linda?
L555789	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
L555788	u7974	m540	LINDA	I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
L555785	u7974	m540	LINDA	I'm Linda Lee.
L555784	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	What can I do for you?
L555783	u7974	m540	LINDA	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
L555782	u7976	m540	MR. DANVERS	Don't you believe in knocking?
L556176	u7978	m540	SELENA	Nonsense.
L556175	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
L556174	u7978	m540	SELENA	Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
L556173	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
L556172	u7978	m540	SELENA	Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
L556161	u7978	m540	SELENA	We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
L556160	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
L555896	u7978	m540	SELENA	Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
L555895	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Nothing's wrong with my skin.
L555894	u7978	m540	SELENA	I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
L555893	u7977	m540	NIGEL	...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
L555892	u7978	m540	SELENA	I could teach you a thing or two now.
L555891	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
L555890	u7978	m540	SELENA	You're wasting your breath.
L555889	u7977	m540	NIGEL	I have to talk to you.
L555888	u7978	m540	SELENA	Nigel, get lost.
L555770	u7978	m540	SELENA	Throw him out.
L555769	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
L555768	u7978	m540	SELENA	You Scorpios can never take a joke.
L555767	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Balefire on you, Selena!
L555765	u7978	m540	SELENA	I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
L555764	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
L555763	u7978	m540	SELENA	Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
L555761	u7977	m540	NIGEL	Cigarette?
L555760	u7978	m540	SELENA	Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
L555759	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
L555758	u7978	m540	SELENA	I just did. Because I have the Power.
L555757	u7977	m540	NIGEL	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
L555756	u7978	m540	SELENA	I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
L555755	u7977	m540	NIGEL	It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
L555754	u7978	m540	SELENA	Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
L556439	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That's home.
L556438	u7978	m540	SELENA	Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
L556437	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
L556435	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
L556434	u7978	m540	SELENA	Where is inner space?
L556432	u7978	m540	SELENA	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
L556431	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
L556430	u7978	m540	SELENA	What's it like?
L556424	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
L556423	u7978	m540	SELENA	Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
L556422	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	For what?
L556421	u7978	m540	SELENA	I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
L556403	u7978	m540	SELENA	Not yet.
L556402	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
L556399	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
L556398	u7978	m540	SELENA	The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
L556132	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Cheap but effective.
L556131	u7978	m540	SELENA	A cheap trick.
L556130	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
L556127	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I don't scare that easily.
L556126	u7978	m540	SELENA	I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
L556125	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Who are you ?
L555927	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
L555926	u7978	m540	SELENA	That was meant for me!
L556392	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Zaltar!
L556391	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Goodbye...
L556390	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
L556389	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Zaltar. Use the wand!
L556388	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
L556387	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Yes, mustn't stop.
L556386	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Don't stop. Keep moving.
L556385	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	What's that? Never saw anything like that.
L556383	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Better than when I was a child.
L556382	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	You can use the wand.
L556350	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
L556349	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	"I heard my mother ask you once ""how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?"" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart."
L556348	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
L556347	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You're going to take me back?
L556345	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
L556344	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
L556343	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
L556342	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
L556341	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Then come with me.
L556340	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
L556338	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
L556337	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Then teach me how.
L556335	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
L556334	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Why?
L556333	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	But it's impossible.
L556332	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I knew it!
L556331	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	There is a way.
L556330	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, that's not true---there's well...no--
L556329	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
L556328	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
L556327	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
L556326	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Of course, my dear. What can I do?
L556325	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Zaltar, please help me.
L556303	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
L556302	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	That horrible woman!
L556292	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
L556291	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	You look at them? How?
L556289	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
L556288	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
L556287	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Are you happy, Zaltar?
L556286	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
L556285	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	It's lovely. . .
L556283	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
L556282	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	What? Palace? Hardly.
L556281	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	"...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."""
L556279	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Criminals.
L556278	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Others?
L556277	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
L556276	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I know.
L556275	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
L556274	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
L556273	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Shouldnt've done that.
L556272	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
L556271	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
L556270	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	I was on Earth...
L556269	u7980	m540	ZALTAR	This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
L556268	u7979	m540	SUPERGIRL	What is this place?
L556913	u7982	m541	BRAD	Nope.  Never. 
L556912	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
L556910	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
L556909	u7982	m541	BRAD	No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
L556908	u7986	m541	GUS	Brad?
L556907	u7982	m541	BRAD	Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
L556906	u7986	m541	GUS	Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
L556905	u7982	m541	BRAD	Brad.
L556904	u7986	m541	GUS	Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
L556901	u7986	m541	GUS	What? What did you tell me?
L556900	u7982	m541	BRAD	Aha! What'd I tell ya!
L556899	u7986	m541	GUS	There's no vodka in it.
L556898	u7982	m541	BRAD	Not enough vodka in it.
L556897	u7986	m541	GUS	Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
L556896	u7982	m541	BRAD	S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
L556894	u7986	m541	GUS	TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
L556893	u7982	m541	BRAD	Tuesday.
L556892	u7986	m541	GUS	Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
L556891	u7982	m541	BRAD	Mr. Roebush?
L556890	u7986	m541	GUS	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
L556889	u7982	m541	BRAD	What are you talkin' about?
L556888	u7986	m541	GUS	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
L556887	u7982	m541	BRAD	What?
L556886	u7986	m541	GUS	Buddy, are we in trouble.
L556885	u7982	m541	BRAD	Yeah? What do you want?
L556720	u7983	m541	CLARK	The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
L556719	u7982	m541	BRAD	The kid needs a man to show him --
L556718	u7983	m541	CLARK	I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
L556717	u7982	m541	BRAD	For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
L556716	u7983	m541	CLARK	Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
L556711	u7982	m541	BRAD	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
L556710	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
L556709	u7982	m541	BRAD	All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
L556708	u7983	m541	CLARK	I seem to be.
L556707	u7982	m541	BRAD	Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
L556636	u7982	m541	BRAD	"Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  ""See"" I mean,  Hahaha!"
L556635	u7983	m541	CLARK	Brad Wilson.
L556634	u7982	m541	BRAD	Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
L557316	u7988	m541	LANA	Anyday...
L557315	u7983	m541	CLARK	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
L557314	u7988	m541	LANA	I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
L557031	u7988	m541	LANA	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
L557030	u7983	m541	CLARK	No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
L556932	u7988	m541	LANA	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
L556931	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I always loved porch swings.
L556883	u7983	m541	CLARK	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
L556882	u7988	m541	LANA	Well, aren't you excited?
L556881	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh-huh.
L556880	u7988	m541	LANA	He really was!
L556861	u7983	m541	CLARK	Can I help?
L556860	u7988	m541	LANA	The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
L556855	u7988	m541	LANA	Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
L556854	u7983	m541	CLARK	Call me.
L556853	u7988	m541	LANA	No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
L556852	u7983	m541	CLARK	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
L556851	u7988	m541	LANA	That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
L556850	u7988	m541	LANA	No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
L556849	u7983	m541	CLARK	Old ties are hard to cut.
L556848	u7988	m541	LANA	I can never get a way from it.
L556846	u7983	m541	CLARK	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
L556845	u7988	m541	LANA	So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
L556844	u7983	m541	CLARK	Me neither...
L556843	u7988	m541	LANA	Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
L556842	u7988	m541	LANA	Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
L556841	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
L556840	u7988	m541	LANA	No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
L556839	u7983	m541	CLARK	No, thanks.
L556838	u7988	m541	LANA	Peanut butter and jelly.
L556835	u7983	m541	CLARK	I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
L556834	u7988	m541	LANA	No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
L556833	u7983	m541	CLARK	There's a lot of choices here.
L556832	u7988	m541	LANA	And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
L556827	u7988	m541	LANA	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
L556826	u7983	m541	CLARK	Me??
L556825	u7988	m541	LANA	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
L556824	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
L556823	u7988	m541	LANA	Some people don't think it's healthy.
L556822	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I haven't done this in years.
L556706	u7988	m541	LANA	I mean him.
L556705	u7983	m541	CLARK	But all he had was chocolate milk.
L556704	u7988	m541	LANA	It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
L556703	u7983	m541	CLARK	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
L556702	u7988	m541	LANA	I just can't stand this.
L556671	u7988	m541	LANA	"I thought ""Clark Kent has a really nice voice."" You didn't even know I was there."
L556670	u7983	m541	CLARK	You thought that?
L556669	u7988	m541	LANA	That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
L556667	u7983	m541	CLARK	Oh...I came close once.
L556666	u7988	m541	LANA	You...um...you never got married?
L556663	u7988	m541	LANA	Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
L556662	u7983	m541	CLARK	Who?
L556661	u7988	m541	LANA	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
L556660	u7983	m541	CLARK	But Lana, you could --
L556659	u7988	m541	LANA	No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
L556658	u7983	m541	CLARK	I didn't --
L556657	u7988	m541	LANA	Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
L556656	u7983	m541	CLARK	Too much mayonnaise?
L556655	u7988	m541	LANA	You know what's the problem?
L556654	u7988	m541	LANA	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
L556653	u7983	m541	CLARK	It sure is.
L556652	u7988	m541	LANA	And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
L556647	u7983	m541	CLARK	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
L556646	u7988	m541	LANA	You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
L556638	u7983	m541	CLARK	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
L556637	u7988	m541	LANA	"I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  ""Would you dance with me?"""
L556625	u7988	m541	LANA	For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
L556624	u7983	m541	CLARK	You're welcome...??
L556623	u7988	m541	LANA	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
L556622	u7983	m541	CLARK	You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
L556619	u7983	m541	CLARK	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
L556618	u7988	m541	LANA	You look wonderful.
L556617	u7988	m541	LANA	Clark.
L556616	u7983	m541	CLARK	Lana Lang. How great to see you.
L557351	u7983	m541	CLARK	I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
L557350	u7992	m541	PERRY	Kent!
L557349	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh...excuse me, folks...
L556529	u7983	m541	CLARK	Oh. You're going away.
L556528	u7992	m541	PERRY	-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
L556517	u7983	m541	CLARK	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
L556516	u7992	m541	PERRY	I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
L556501	u7992	m541	PERRY	Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
L556500	u7983	m541	CLARK	Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
L556493	u7992	m541	PERRY	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
L556492	u7983	m541	CLARK	Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
L557313	u7983	m541	CLARK	Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
L557312	u7993	m541	RICKY	Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
L556940	u7993	m541	RICKY	Could you get me Superman's autograph?
L556939	u7983	m541	CLARK	Sure.
L556938	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
L556937	u7983	m541	CLARK	We get together sometimes.
L556936	u7993	m541	RICKY	Do you really know Superman?
L556879	u7983	m541	CLARK	What!
L556878	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
L556830	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mom and I do this all the time.
L556829	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well...  Not quite like this.
L557336	u7989	m541	LOIS	Oh?
L557335	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
L557334	u7989	m541	LOIS	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
L557333	u7983	m541	CLARK	You're the best, Lois.
L556519	u7989	m541	LOIS	Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
L556518	u7983	m541	CLARK	So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
L556511	u7983	m541	CLARK	Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
L556510	u7989	m541	LOIS	Say!
L556509	u7983	m541	CLARK	Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
L556577	u7987	m541	JIMMY	You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
L556576	u7983	m541	CLARK	What are you doing?
L556575	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
L556564	u7983	m541	CLARK	At one o'clock in the morning?
L556563	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
L556562	u7983	m541	CLARK	What's that?
L556561	u7987	m541	JIMMY	The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
L556560	u7983	m541	CLARK	Mmmmm . . .
L556559	u7987	m541	JIMMY	But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
L556506	u7987	m541	JIMMY	I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
L556505	u7983	m541	CLARK	It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
L556462	u7986	m541	GUS	What about this week's check?
L556461	u7984	m541	CLERK	You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
L556460	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
L556459	u7984	m541	CLERK	Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
L556458	u7986	m541	GUS	I know, I'm the fault.
L556457	u7984	m541	CLERK	Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
L556456	u7986	m541	GUS	"Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? ""Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!"" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet."
L556455	u7984	m541	CLERK	The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
L556454	u7986	m541	GUS	Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
L556453	u7984	m541	CLERK	A television set?
L556452	u7986	m541	GUS	They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
L556451	u7984	m541	CLERK	Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
L556450	u7986	m541	GUS	Thirty-five.
L556449	u7984	m541	CLERK	Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
L556448	u7986	m541	GUS	Nope, but --
L556447	u7984	m541	CLERK	Dishwasher? Any luck?
L556446	u7986	m541	GUS	Kitchen. . . Technician
L556445	u7984	m541	CLERK	What kind?
L556444	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah.
L556443	u7984	m541	CLERK	Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
L556442	u7986	m541	GUS	Gus Gorman.
L556441	u7984	m541	CLERK	Name?
L556726	u7986	m541	GUS	Say who?
L556725	u7985	m541	FRED	The boss wants to see you.
L556724	u7986	m541	GUS	Say what?
L556723	u7985	m541	FRED	Gus?
L556555	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah. A raise . .
L556554	u7985	m541	FRED	Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
L556553	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
L556552	u7985	m541	FRED	Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
L556550	u7986	m541	GUS	One.  And a half.
L556549	u7985	m541	FRED	How many sugars?
L556548	u7985	m541	FRED	They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
L556547	u7986	m541	GUS	So where is all them half-centses?
L556546	u7985	m541	FRED	No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
L556545	u7986	m541	GUS	Who gets it, the company?
L556544	u7985	m541	FRED	They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
L556543	u7986	m541	GUS	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
L556542	u7985	m541	FRED	Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
L556541	u7986	m541	GUS	I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
L556540	u7985	m541	FRED	That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
L556539	u7986	m541	GUS	First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
L556538	u7985	m541	FRED	First paycheck?
L556537	u7986	m541	GUS	Sonofagun! Look at this here!
L557240	u7994	m541	ROSS	Join the party, genius! Come on up!
L557239	u7986	m541	GUS	Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
L557211	u7994	m541	ROSS	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
L557210	u7986	m541	GUS	You want to mess with Superman?
L557168	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
L557167	u7994	m541	ROSS	Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
L557166	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
L557165	u7994	m541	ROSS	Can you do that?
L557164	u7986	m541	GUS	Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
L557163	u7994	m541	ROSS	But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
L557162	u7994	m541	ROSS	Exactly. Stoned mother.
L557161	u7986	m541	GUS	Stone mutha.
L557160	u7994	m541	ROSS	"Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking ""get-down hot-cha daddy-o"" whatever you called it."
L557159	u7986	m541	GUS	I told you it wasn't no jive.
L557158	u7994	m541	ROSS	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
L557157	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah? How's it look?
L557126	u7994	m541	ROSS	Tell me more...
L557125	u7986	m541	GUS	Anything.
L557124	u7994	m541	ROSS	What will it get me?
L557123	u7986	m541	GUS	Everything.
L557122	u7994	m541	ROSS	What will it do?
L557121	u7986	m541	GUS	I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
L557120	u7994	m541	ROSS	You designed it?
L557119	u7986	m541	GUS	Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
L557118	u7994	m541	ROSS	We've already got some.
L557117	u7986	m541	GUS	A computer.
L557116	u7994	m541	ROSS	For what?
L557115	u7994	m541	ROSS	A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
L557114	u7994	m541	ROSS	What do you want?
L557113	u7986	m541	GUS	Fair's fair.
L557112	u7994	m541	ROSS	Is this whitemail?
L557111	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
L557110	u7994	m541	ROSS	Is this blackmail?
L557109	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
L557108	u7994	m541	ROSS	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
L557107	u7986	m541	GUS	Now...when do I get a taste?
L557105	u7986	m541	GUS	The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
L557104	u7994	m541	ROSS	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
L557103	u7986	m541	GUS	Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
L557102	u7994	m541	ROSS	Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
L557101	u7986	m541	GUS	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
L557100	u7994	m541	ROSS	And then shut down the pipe lines.
L557096	u7994	m541	ROSS	You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
L557095	u7986	m541	GUS	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
L557094	u7994	m541	ROSS	And do nothing. Just sit there.
L557091	u7994	m541	ROSS	Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
L557090	u7986	m541	GUS	They ain't got captains?
L557089	u7994	m541	ROSS	Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
L557081	u7986	m541	GUS	Huh?
L557080	u7994	m541	ROSS	KRYPTONITE!
L557079	u7986	m541	GUS	He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
L557017	u7986	m541	GUS	Greed!  Let me tell you something---
L557016	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
L557015	u7986	m541	GUS	That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
L557014	u7994	m541	ROSS	God, that's what I keep you for.
L557013	u7986	m541	GUS	Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
L557010	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
L557009	u7986	m541	GUS	It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
L556983	u7994	m541	ROSS	What are you talking about, fella?
L556982	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...what channel were you watching?
L556981	u7994	m541	ROSS	I did. isn't it neat-o?
L556980	u7986	m541	GUS	Turn on the T.V.
L556979	u7994	m541	ROSS	Just the man I wanted to see!
L556978	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey, boss.
L556816	u7986	m541	GUS	"Not ""What."" Don't need a genius to figure out ""what."" Need a genius to figure out ""where.""  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into."
L556815	u7994	m541	ROSS	What?
L556814	u7986	m541	GUS	"First question got to be ""Where."""
L556813	u7994	m541	ROSS	When?
L556812	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
L556811	u7994	m541	ROSS	Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
L556786	u7994	m541	ROSS	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
L556785	u7986	m541	GUS	How do you do that?
L556779	u7986	m541	GUS	That what they call you?
L556778	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
L556775	u7986	m541	GUS	Me? How?
L556774	u7994	m541	ROSS	"A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... ""It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail.""  And you are going to do it for me."
L556773	u7986	m541	GUS	But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
L556768	u7994	m541	ROSS	Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
L556767	u7986	m541	GUS	Wipe 'em out?
L556766	u7994	m541	ROSS	Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
L556765	u7986	m541	GUS	Columbia.
L556764	u7994	m541	ROSS	Columbia.
L556763	u7986	m541	GUS	Which country?
L556762	u7994	m541	ROSS	But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
L556761	u7986	m541	GUS	Decaffeinated too?
L556760	u7994	m541	ROSS	Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
L556758	u7994	m541	ROSS	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
L556757	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, what is this?
L556756	u7994	m541	ROSS	I don't think you understand.
L556755	u7986	m541	GUS	Black or regular?
L556754	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
L556753	u7986	m541	GUS	I'm tryin' to.
L556752	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
L556748	u7986	m541	GUS	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
L556747	u7994	m541	ROSS	Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
L556746	u7986	m541	GUS	Or socks.
L556745	u7994	m541	ROSS	I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
L556744	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
L556743	u7994	m541	ROSS	Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
L556742	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...
L556741	u7994	m541	ROSS	"Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- ""dig where you're comin' from.""  You want to be rich, right?"
L556740	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
L556739	u7994	m541	ROSS	You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
L556738	u7994	m541	ROSS	Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
L556737	u7986	m541	GUS	Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
L557300	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
L557299	u7986	m541	GUS	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
L557298	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Thanks.  Let's go
L557293	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Just a second.
L557292	u7986	m541	GUS	Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
L557291	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No...I just have a little stop to make.
L557290	u7986	m541	GUS	We back in Metropolis?
L557289	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
L557288	u7986	m541	GUS	We gonna crash?
L557287	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No, we're just going down.
L557286	u7986	m541	GUS	Watch out for them air pockets!
L557285	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
L557284	u7986	m541	GUS	I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
L557283	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, you're perfectly safe.
L557282	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
L557281	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	How you doing down there?
L557099	u7997	m541	VERA	Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
L557098	u7986	m541	GUS	I know, by computers.
L557093	u7986	m541	GUS	And do what?
L557092	u7997	m541	VERA	You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
L556803	u7986	m541	GUS	What she call you?
L556802	u7997	m541	VERA	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
L556801	u7986	m541	GUS	Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
L556777	u7997	m541	VERA	Sister! I'm his sister!
L556776	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
L556796	u7987	m541	JIMMY	It was hot!
L556795	u7992	m541	PERRY	You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
L556794	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Why do I have to do this?
L556525	u7987	m541	JIMMY	A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
L556524	u7992	m541	PERRY	What about you?
L556523	u7987	m541	JIMMY	What about me?
L556522	u7992	m541	PERRY	All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
L556487	u7992	m541	PERRY	A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
L556486	u7987	m541	JIMMY	I didn't have my camera with me.
L556485	u7992	m541	PERRY	You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
L556482	u7987	m541	JIMMY	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
L556481	u7992	m541	PERRY	Who's the other woman?
L556479	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
L556478	u7992	m541	PERRY	Who is she?
L557065	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
L557064	u7988	m541	LANA	Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
L557063	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
L557062	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
L557061	u7988	m541	LANA	But the bridge...
L557060	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	There's no rush.
L557057	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	You just did, with that great dinner.
L557056	u7988	m541	LANA	He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
L557039	u7988	m541	LANA	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
L557038	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
L556873	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
L556872	u7988	m541	LANA	And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
L556871	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	We've already met.
L556870	u7988	m541	LANA	Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
L556869	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Anytime.
L556868	u7988	m541	LANA	Thank ...you.
L556867	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
L556866	u7988	m541	LANA	Ricky?  Where...what...
L557332	u7989	m541	LOIS	I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
L557331	u7992	m541	PERRY	Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
L556527	u7992	m541	PERRY	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
L556526	u7989	m541	LOIS	Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
L556504	u7989	m541	LOIS	Whoopee.
L556503	u7992	m541	PERRY	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
L556502	u7989	m541	LOIS	What terrific story?
L556484	u7989	m541	LOIS	The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
L556483	u7992	m541	PERRY	The picture looks blurry.
L557245	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
L557244	u7990	m541	LORELEI	But the other night...
L557243	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I don't know you, lady.
L557144	u7990	m541	LORELEI	It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
L557143	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
L557142	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
L557141	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
L557140	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
L557139	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Tell me.
L557138	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Lots of things...
L557137	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
L557136	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
L557135	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
L557134	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
L557133	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I thought you'd never get here.
L557266	u7990	m541	LORELEI	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
L557265	u7997	m541	VERA	I can't! It's out of control!
L557234	u7990	m541	LORELEI	He can have mine. Anytime.
L557233	u7997	m541	VERA	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
L557232	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Oh, Superman!
L557230	u7990	m541	LORELEI	In other words, push this red button.
L557229	u7997	m541	VERA	You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
L557226	u7997	m541	VERA	Superman. The boy you left behind.
L557225	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Gus?
L557224	u7997	m541	VERA	Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
L557217	u7997	m541	VERA	Where do you usually find a light switch?
L557216	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Where's the light switch?
L557215	u7997	m541	VERA	Turn on the light.
L557214	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I can't see anything.
L557076	u7990	m541	LORELEI	And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
L557075	u7997	m541	VERA	At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining. ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
L557003	u7997	m541	VERA	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
L557002	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Hey, I know a lot of things!
L557001	u7997	m541	VERA	How would you know?
L556968	u7997	m541	VERA	"Energy! And when they say ""Energy"" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped."
L556967	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Diet soda?
L556966	u7997	m541	VERA	Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
L556686	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
L556685	u7997	m541	VERA	If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
L556682	u7997	m541	VERA	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
L556681	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
L557347	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	There is no handle! You just push a button.
L557346	u7992	m541	PERRY	Where's the handle?
L557345	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
L556793	u7992	m541	PERRY	Why do I have to do this?
L556792	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
L556535	u7992	m541	PERRY	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
L556534	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	By hand. Like the pioneers did.
L556533	u7992	m541	PERRY	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
L556532	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, the next number, please?
L556499	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	You've got to pick three more numbers.
L556498	u7992	m541	PERRY	Okay? Goodbye.
L556497	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	53!
L556496	u7992	m541	PERRY	53.
L556491	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
L556490	u7992	m541	PERRY	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
L556489	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
L556695	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
L556694	u7994	m541	ROSS	Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
L556684	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	Hello.
L556683	u7994	m541	ROSS	Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
L556680	u7994	m541	ROSS	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
L556679	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	"I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up.""  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!"
L556676	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
L556675	u7994	m541	ROSS	Missing????
L556674	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	85,000 dollars.
L557258	u7994	m541	ROSS	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
L557257	u7997	m541	VERA	Yes! This time we got it right!
L557255	u7997	m541	VERA	Don't bet on it!
L557254	u7994	m541	ROSS	He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
L557223	u7997	m541	VERA	Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
L557222	u7994	m541	ROSS	He's the only one who can operate this --
L557221	u7997	m541	VERA	Who needs Gus?
L557220	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
L557219	u7997	m541	VERA	Come on, let's give it a dry run.
L557128	u7997	m541	VERA	Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
L557127	u7994	m541	ROSS	That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
L557085	u7997	m541	VERA	We can get to work on that oil!
L557084	u7994	m541	ROSS	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
L557083	u7997	m541	VERA	A normal person.
L557082	u7994	m541	ROSS	Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
L557012	u7994	m541	ROSS	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
L557011	u7997	m541	VERA	So?
L557008	u7994	m541	ROSS	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
L557007	u7997	m541	VERA	Where did it come from?
L557006	u7994	m541	ROSS	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
L557005	u7997	m541	VERA	What's wrong?
L557004	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
L556996	u7997	m541	VERA	How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
L556995	u7994	m541	ROSS	Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
L556992	u7997	m541	VERA	Don't cry, Bubba.
L556991	u7994	m541	ROSS	He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
L556977	u7994	m541	ROSS	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
L556976	u7997	m541	VERA	Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
L556975	u7994	m541	ROSS	We already have a super-tanker.
L556974	u7997	m541	VERA	Small potatoes.
L556971	u7994	m541	ROSS	TOMORROW THE OIL!
L556970	u7997	m541	VERA	Today coffee----
L556969	u7994	m541	ROSS	You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
L556818	u7994	m541	ROSS	Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
L556817	u7997	m541	VERA	Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
L556807	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
L556806	u7997	m541	VERA	She's not his mama either.
L556800	u7997	m541	VERA	Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
L556799	u7994	m541	ROSS	Computers talk to other computers, right?
L556784	u7997	m541	VERA	Blizzards! Heat waves!
L556783	u7994	m541	ROSS	Storms! Floods!
L556782	u7997	m541	VERA	It could make weather!
L556781	u7994	m541	ROSS	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
L556692	u7994	m541	ROSS	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
L556691	u7997	m541	VERA	I don't kiss.
L556678	u7994	m541	ROSS	Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
L556677	u7997	m541	VERA	That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
L558690	u7998	m542	CLARK	She'll be fine.
L558689	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Are you okay?
L557999	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
L557998	u7998	m542	CLARK	Hostages?
L557997	u8001	m542	JIMMY	So far the hostages are unharmed.
L557996	u7998	m542	CLARK	Anybody been hurt?
L557985	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Yeah. I'll check.
L557984	u7998	m542	CLARK	Jimmy, how's the -
L558703	u8004	m542	LOIS	Everything on it.
L558702	u7998	m542	CLARK	Everything on it?
L558701	u8004	m542	LOIS	Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
L558700	u7998	m542	CLARK	You do?
L558699	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
L558698	u7998	m542	CLARK	I'll try to remember that . . .
L558697	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
L558696	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I really don't see why --
L558695	u8004	m542	LOIS	. . . Superman?. . . . .
L558693	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
L558692	u7998	m542	CLARK	Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
L558691	u8004	m542	LOIS	See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
L558684	u7998	m542	CLARK	I like worrying about you.
L558683	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Please don't tell me ""You'll find somebody else someday."" Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me."
L558682	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, someday --
L558681	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
L558680	u7998	m542	CLARK	What else could I do?
L558679	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say ""Help. Come quick. Now"" I know who you'd have to pick."
L558678	u7998	m542	CLARK	They?
L558677	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
L558676	u7998	m542	CLARK	You're not selfish at all.
L558675	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, ""It's like being married to a doctor,"" I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, "" could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . """
L558674	u7998	m542	CLARK	I'm sorry.
L558673	u8004	m542	LOIS	"I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I ""listened to the voices of  reason"" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?"
L558671	u8004	m542	LOIS	Never closed my eyes.
L558670	u7998	m542	CLARK	Sleep well?
L558669	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, hi.
L558668	u7998	m542	CLARK	Hi.
L558495	u7998	m542	CLARK	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
L558494	u8004	m542	LOIS	Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
L558493	u7998	m542	CLARK	I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
L558492	u8004	m542	LOIS	But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
L558491	u7998	m542	CLARK	I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
L558481	u7998	m542	CLARK	I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
L558480	u8004	m542	LOIS	I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
L558479	u7998	m542	CLARK	Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
L558478	u8004	m542	LOIS	Let's get you inside . . . .
L558477	u7998	m542	CLARK	Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
L558473	u7998	m542	CLARK	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
L558472	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
L558450	u7998	m542	CLARK	Say you love me.
L558449	u8004	m542	LOIS	You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
L558286	u8004	m542	LOIS	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
L558285	u7998	m542	CLARK	Let's go to my place.
L558284	u7998	m542	CLARK	Let's go to my place.
L558283	u8004	m542	LOIS	I want to.
L558282	u7998	m542	CLARK	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
L558281	u8004	m542	LOIS	What's happening. Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
L558280	u7998	m542	CLARK	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
L558279	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm listening.
L558278	u7998	m542	CLARK	We'd better talk.
L558277	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
L558274	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
L558273	u7998	m542	CLARK	I didn't think I wanted to.
L558272	u8004	m542	LOIS	Maybe you wanted to.
L558269	u7998	m542	CLARK	Oh come on, that's ridic -
L558268	u8004	m542	LOIS	I was right. you are Superman.
L558267	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I . . .
L558266	u8004	m542	LOIS	It's true. It's true.
L558248	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
L558247	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh Clark, no!
L558238	u7998	m542	CLARK	What??
L558237	u8004	m542	LOIS	Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
L558236	u7998	m542	CLARK	How could you win a crazy bet like --
L558235	u8004	m542	LOIS	Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
L558234	u7998	m542	CLARK	You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
L558233	u7998	m542	CLARK	No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
L558232	u8004	m542	LOIS	Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
L558231	u7998	m542	CLARK	Who ????
L558229	u7998	m542	CLARK	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
L558228	u8004	m542	LOIS	Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
L558227	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
L558223	u8004	m542	LOIS	And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
L558222	u7998	m542	CLARK	Superman? Oh, was he here?
L558221	u8004	m542	LOIS	I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
L558220	u7998	m542	CLARK	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
L558219	u8004	m542	LOIS	Where were you?
L558208	u8004	m542	LOIS	Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
L558207	u7998	m542	CLARK	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
L558206	u8004	m542	LOIS	Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
L558205	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, you're amazing.
L558204	u8004	m542	LOIS	Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
L558199	u8004	m542	LOIS	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
L558198	u7998	m542	CLARK	I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
L558195	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Mr. Smith -  -- the ""complimentary couch."""
L558194	u7998	m542	CLARK	I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
L558193	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
L558192	u7998	m542	CLARK	"A ""complimentary corsage."""
L558189	u8004	m542	LOIS	Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
L558187	u7998	m542	CLARK	Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
L558186	u8004	m542	LOIS	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
L558185	u7998	m542	CLARK	'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
L558179	u8004	m542	LOIS	In July???
L558178	u7998	m542	CLARK	It is kinda romantic.
L558089	u8004	m542	LOIS	Of course, that's what friends are for.
L558088	u7998	m542	CLARK	Really?
L558087	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
L558085	u8004	m542	LOIS	Be my guest.
L558084	u7998	m542	CLARK	Maybe I could try --
L558083	u8004	m542	LOIS	Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
L558082	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
L558080	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
L558079	u7998	m542	CLARK	Actually, yes.
L558078	u8004	m542	LOIS	Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
L558077	u7998	m542	CLARK	I do?
L558076	u8004	m542	LOIS	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
L558075	u7998	m542	CLARK	I don't?
L558072	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
L558071	u7998	m542	CLARK	One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
L558070	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
L558069	u7998	m542	CLARK	Uh. . .
L558068	u8004	m542	LOIS	When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
L558067	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, what are you doing?
L558066	u8004	m542	LOIS	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
L558065	u7998	m542	CLARK	Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
L558064	u8004	m542	LOIS	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
L558063	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I usually do.
L558009	u7998	m542	CLARK	No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
L558008	u8007	m542	PERRY	No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
L558007	u7998	m542	CLARK	Gee. But --
L558006	u8007	m542	PERRY	The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
L558005	u7998	m542	CLARK	What??
L558004	u8007	m542	PERRY	Does she know about it? She's in it!
L558003	u7998	m542	CLARK	Does Lois know about this yet?
L558002	u8007	m542	PERRY	That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
L558001	u7998	m542	CLARK	But . . ..that's terrible!
L557993	u8007	m542	PERRY	Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
L557992	u7998	m542	CLARK	Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
L557991	u8007	m542	PERRY	Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
L557990	u7998	m542	CLARK	Uh...home...
L557989	u8007	m542	PERRY	Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
L558335	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
L558334	u7999	m542	EVE	Good. My heart can't take it.
L558333	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	You'll miss the battle of the century!
L558315	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
L558314	u7999	m542	EVE	I like trees.
L558290	u7999	m542	EVE	I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
L558289	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	A good time! Is that all you care about?!
L558288	u7999	m542	EVE	Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
L558287	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Mush!  Mush!
L558166	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	North!
L558165	u7999	m542	EVE	You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
L558164	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	A parka.
L558163	u7999	m542	EVE	A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
L558162	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	You'll have to pack quickly.
L558161	u7999	m542	EVE	There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
L558160	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
L558159	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	What else is ballast for?
L558158	u7999	m542	EVE	Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
L558302	u8003	m542	LEX	It's beautiful.
L558301	u7999	m542	EVE	That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
L558300	u8003	m542	LEX	Why didn't you go before we left?
L558299	u7999	m542	EVE	Wrong.
L558298	u8003	m542	LEX	It has everything.
L558297	u7999	m542	EVE	It's beautiful.
L558296	u8003	m542	LEX	It's beautiful.
L558295	u7999	m542	EVE	No, me, me, me. Thank you.
L558294	u8003	m542	LEX	I'll be alright.
L558293	u7999	m542	EVE	Genius!  --  Lex.
L558292	u8003	m542	LEX	It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
L558291	u7999	m542	EVE	This way Lex.
L558157	u8003	m542	LEX	Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
L558156	u7999	m542	EVE	Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
L558155	u8003	m542	LEX	Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
L558142	u8000	m542	FIRST CONTROLLER	How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
L558141	u8009	m542	SECOND CONTROLLER	Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
L558140	u8000	m542	FIRST CONTROLLER	What's a curl?
L558139	u8009	m542	SECOND CONTROLLER	"I think he said a ""curl."""
L558138	u8000	m542	FIRST CONTROLLER	What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
L558137	u8009	m542	SECOND CONTROLLER	Artemis? Do you read me?
L558529	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
L558528	u8007	m542	PERRY	Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
L558527	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
L558526	u8007	m542	PERRY	I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
L557995	u8007	m542	PERRY	He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
L557994	u8001	m542	JIMMY	A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
L557986	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
L558439	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Yes.
L558438	u8002	m542	LARA	And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
L558437	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
L558436	u8002	m542	LARA	Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
L558435	u8002	m542	LARA	Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
L558434	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Yes, but it's not all I feel.
L558433	u8002	m542	LARA	You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
L558432	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
L558431	u8002	m542	LARA	You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
L558328	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	I didn't ask her anything . . .
L558327	u8002	m542	LARA	The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
L558326	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	I asked the right question.
L558325	u8002	m542	LARA	The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
L558324	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	No possibility for parole?
L558323	u8002	m542	LARA	And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
L558322	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Sensible enough.
L558321	u8002	m542	LARA	The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -

L558426	u8004	m542	LOIS	It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.

L558607	u8014	m542	ZOD	Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
L558603	u8014	m542	ZOD	He ran in fear from us . . .
L558488	u8014	m542	ZOD	Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
L558487	u8008	m542	PRESIDENT	You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
L558486	u8014	m542	ZOD	Who is this . . . Superman?
L558463	u8014	m542	ZOD	Zod.  Zod.

L558461	u8014	m542	ZOD	Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
L558458	u8014	m542	ZOD	It will. Starting with your own.
L558021	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
L558020	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	Yes, but will you honor it?
L558019	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
L558018	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
L558017	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
L558016	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
L558640	u8013	m542	URSA	Super-sucker .  For once, Lex Luthor was right.
L558639	u8014	m542	ZOD	Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
L558629	u8014	m542	ZOD	We must combine our strength.
L558628	u8013	m542	URSA	General --- ?
L558577	u8014	m542	ZOD	Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
L558576	u8013	m542	URSA	He's captured Non!
L558575	u8013	m542	URSA	Sentimental idiot.
L558574	u8014	m542	ZOD	He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
L558573	u8013	m542	URSA	Yes?
L558572	u8014	m542	ZOD	"This ""super"" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness."
L558499	u8014	m542	ZOD	And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
L558498	u8013	m542	URSA	You are master of all you survey.
L558446	u8014	m542	ZOD	Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
L558445	u8013	m542	URSA	Look, they need a machine to fly.
L558256	u8014	m542	ZOD	Stay. I will come to you.
L558255	u8013	m542	URSA	What shall we do now?
L558254	u8014	m542	ZOD	So this is the planet Houston . . .
L558150	u8014	m542	ZOD	And I will lead.
L558148	u8014	m542	ZOD	Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
L558146	u8014	m542	ZOD	Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
L558145	u8013	m542	URSA	Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
L558056	u8013	m542	URSA	Free!
L558055	u8014	m542	ZOD	Free!
L559283	u8015	m543	CLARK	Lacy. . . I . . .
L559282	u8018	m543	LACY	Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
L559281	u8015	m543	CLARK	You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
L559280	u8018	m543	LACY	You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
L559279	u8015	m543	CLARK	Like me?
L559278	u8018	m543	LACY	Any more like you back home, Clark?
L559277	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not so sure you do.
L559276	u8018	m543	LACY	You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
L559275	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm sorry to see you go.
L559274	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
L559110	u8018	m543	LACY	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
L559109	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I'm really sorry.
L559107	u8018	m543	LACY	Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
L559106	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
L559096	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. . . !
L559095	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . my . . .
L559093	u8015	m543	CLARK	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
L559092	u8018	m543	LACY	I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
L559076	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
L559075	u8018	m543	LACY	Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
L559066	u8018	m543	LACY	. . . Let me get my purse.
L559065	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
L559024	u8018	m543	LACY	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
L559023	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I don't think . . .
L559022	u8018	m543	LACY	I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
L559021	u8015	m543	CLARK	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
L559020	u8018	m543	LACY	Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
L559019	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
L559018	u8018	m543	LACY	He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
L559011	u8015	m543	CLARK	If you say so. Here goes.
L559010	u8018	m543	LACY	Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
L559009	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
L559008	u8015	m543	CLARK	Maybe I should sit this one out.
L558916	u8015	m543	CLARK	Don't worry, I've got you.
L558915	u8018	m543	LACY	I feel kind of light-headed . . .
L558914	u8018	m543	LACY	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
L558913	u8015	m543	CLARK	That sounds kind of pessimistic.
L558912	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
L558911	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
L558910	u8018	m543	LACY	What about here?
L558909	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
L558908	u8018	m543	LACY	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
L558907	u8015	m543	CLARK	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
L558906	u8018	m543	LACY	My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
L558905	u8015	m543	CLARK	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
L558904	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
L558899	u8018	m543	LACY	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
L558898	u8015	m543	CLARK	I've never been in a place like this before.
L558893	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
L558892	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
L558891	u8018	m543	LACY	You're late. Very late.
L558845	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
L558844	u8015	m543	CLARK	They make my eyes itch.
L558843	u8018	m543	LACY	That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
L558842	u8015	m543	CLARK	And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
L558841	u8018	m543	LACY	But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
L558840	u8015	m543	CLARK	I really don't think . . .
L558839	u8018	m543	LACY	It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
L559290	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
L559289	u8021	m543	LOIS	It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
L559191	u8015	m543	CLARK	You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
L559190	u8021	m543	LOIS	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
L559189	u8015	m543	CLARK	Superman? Has something happened to him?
L559187	u8021	m543	LOIS	You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
L559186	u8015	m543	CLARK	It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
L559151	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
L559150	u8015	m543	CLARK	. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
L559070	u8015	m543	CLARK	Politely?
L559069	u8021	m543	LOIS	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
L559068	u8015	m543	CLARK	'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
L558851	u8021	m543	LOIS	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
L558850	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
L558812	u8021	m543	LOIS	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
L558811	u8015	m543	CLARK	The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
L558801	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark . . . wait!
L558800	u8015	m543	CLARK	I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
L558799	u8021	m543	LOIS	No Paris?
L558777	u8021	m543	LOIS	Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
L558776	u8015	m543	CLARK	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
L558775	u8021	m543	LOIS	Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
L559175	u8020	m543	LEX	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
L559174	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
L559005	u8020	m543	LEX	If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
L559004	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And what do we get out of it?
L559001	u8020	m543	LEX	Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
L559000	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
L558999	u8020	m543	LEX	Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
L558997	u8020	m543	LEX	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
L558996	u8016	m543	HOWLER	But Superman isn't an average man.
L558995	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
L558994	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
L559310	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
L559309	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
L559308	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Go on . . .
L559307	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
L559306	u8017	m543	JEREMY	I'll try. . .
L559305	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
L559304	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Awesome!
L558967	u8017	m543	JEREMY	N-no...I mean...you bet.
L558966	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
L558963	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Absolutely!
L558962	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind taking a walk with me?
L558869	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm sorry.
L558868	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well, I don't understand.
L558866	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
L558865	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
L558864	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
L558863	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Impossible? Why?
L559208	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
L559207	u8018	m543	LACY	No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
L559206	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
L559205	u8018	m543	LACY	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
L559204	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
L559160	u8018	m543	LACY	Stuff it.
L559159	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Yes, darling?
L559158	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy . . . ?
L559157	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
L559156	u8018	m543	LACY	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
L559155	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
L558930	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
L558929	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
L558928	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
L558927	u8018	m543	LACY	Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
L558798	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Mr. White, come with me I want to see
L558797	u8018	m543	LACY	Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
L559105	u8021	m543	LOIS	It always is with Clark.
L559104	u8018	m543	LACY	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
L559103	u8021	m543	LOIS	Where's Clark?
L559079	u8021	m543	LOIS	Our other dinner guest.
L559078	u8018	m543	LACY	What's that?
L558974	u8021	m543	LOIS	Something . . . wonderful.
L558973	u8018	m543	LACY	What's he going to say?
L558957	u8018	m543	LACY	Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
L558956	u8021	m543	LOIS	But he's never there.
L558955	u8018	m543	LACY	Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
L558954	u8021	m543	LOIS	And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
L558953	u8018	m543	LACY	Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
L558952	u8021	m543	LOIS	That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
L558951	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
L558950	u8021	m543	LOIS	Who?
L558949	u8018	m543	LACY	I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
L558856	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
L558855	u8021	m543	LOIS	An angle?
L558854	u8018	m543	LACY	I think there's an angle.
L558849	u8018	m543	LACY	Superman gets mail here?
L558848	u8021	m543	LOIS	This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
L558809	u8021	m543	LOIS	. . . And  very na?ve!
L558808	u8018	m543	LACY	But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
L558807	u8021	m543	LOIS	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
L558806	u8018	m543	LACY	I think he's kind of cute.
L558804	u8021	m543	LOIS	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
L558803	u8018	m543	LACY	Is he for real?
L559260	u8019	m543	LENNY	Lucky I brought my drums.
L559259	u8020	m543	LEX	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
L559258	u8019	m543	LENNY	You think he'll find us.
L559229	u8020	m543	LEX	If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
L559228	u8019	m543	LENNY	Ready, Uncle Lex?
L559227	u8020	m543	LEX	Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
L559218	u8019	m543	LENNY	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
L559217	u8020	m543	LEX	This wasn't in the plan.
L559216	u8019	m543	LENNY	We'll all fry.
L559132	u8020	m543	LEX	My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
L559131	u8019	m543	LENNY	Boy, are you gonna get it.
L559056	u8019	m543	LENNY	What?
L559055	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
L559054	u8019	m543	LENNY	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
L559053	u8020	m543	LEX	He's . . . cold. . .
L559052	u8020	m543	LEX	Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
L559051	u8019	m543	LENNY	Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
L559050	u8020	m543	LEX	What was that about?
L559043	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're just an experiment, freako!
L559042	u8020	m543	LEX	Hey! Just remember I made you.
L559036	u8020	m543	LEX	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
L559035	u8019	m543	LENNY	Hey! He looks . . . normal.
L559034	u8020	m543	LEX	There!
L559033	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
L559032	u8020	m543	LEX	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
L559031	u8019	m543	LENNY	The one Superman wrecked up?
L559030	u8020	m543	LEX	Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
L559029	u8019	m543	LENNY	Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
L558990	u8020	m543	LEX	Get the box, nephew.
L558989	u8019	m543	LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
L558924	u8020	m543	LEX	I must have miscalculated. How. . .
L558923	u8019	m543	LENNY	Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
L558889	u8020	m543	LEX	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
L558888	u8019	m543	LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
L558884	u8020	m543	LEX	He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
L558883	u8019	m543	LENNY	Whoa. . .
L558877	u8020	m543	LEX	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
L558876	u8019	m543	LENNY	He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
L558838	u8020	m543	LEX	That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
L558837	u8019	m543	LENNY	But why the hair?
L558836	u8020	m543	LEX	. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
L558835	u8019	m543	LENNY	A toupee that flies?
L558834	u8020	m543	LEX	Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
L558767	u8020	m543	LEX	Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
L558766	u8019	m543	LENNY	Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
L559200	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	I am master now.
L559199	u8020	m543	LEX	Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
L559183	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	Destiny.
L559182	u8020	m543	LEX	Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
L559181	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	What do you fear?
L559180	u8020	m543	LEX	Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
L559146	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	First, I have fun.
L559145	u8020	m543	LEX	Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
L559135	u8020	m543	LEX	Wait! Not yet! Back!
L559134	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	Destroy Superman!
L559046	u8020	m543	LEX	I made you, and I can destroy you.
L559045	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	I am an experiment? I am freako?
L559041	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
L559040	u8020	m543	LEX	What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
L559039	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	You are . . .
L559038	u8020	m543	LEX	I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
L558881	u8020	m543	LEX	For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
L558880	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	What I need this for?
L559264	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
L559263	u8020	m543	LEX	But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
L559262	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
L559261	u8020	m543	LEX	But . . . how could you beat him?
L559236	u8020	m543	LEX	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
L559235	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'll deal with you later.
L559232	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
L559231	u8020	m543	LEX	Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
L559144	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
L559143	u8020	m543	LEX	Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
L559142	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
L559141	u8020	m543	LEX	Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
L559140	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
L559139	u8020	m543	LEX	I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
L559138	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm not going anywhere.
L559137	u8020	m543	LEX	No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
L559136	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
L559129	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
L559128	u8020	m543	LEX	Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
L559127	u8020	m543	LEX	Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
L559126	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
L559125	u8020	m543	LEX	Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
L559124	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
L559123	u8020	m543	LEX	Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
L559122	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
L559121	u8020	m543	LEX	Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
L585619	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Thanks.
L585618	u8226	m559	DAFFY	Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.

L585616	u8226	m559	DAFFY	Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
L585615	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
L585614	u8226	m559	DAFFY	You. You're the guy that lent me the money.

L585605	u8226	m559	DAFFY	I'll share something with you.

L585603	u8230	m559	RICHARD	I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
L585602	u8226	m559	DAFFY	I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
L585601	u8230	m559	RICHARD	I'm sorry, I don't think so.
L585600	u8226	m559	DAFFY	Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
L585599	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Help you out?

L585648	u8227	m559	DETECTIVE	Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
L585647	u8230	m559	RICHARD	I don't think so.
L585646	u8227	m559	DETECTIVE	You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
L585645	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Traveler.
L585644	u8227	m559	DETECTIVE	What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
L585762	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Fuck off.
L585761	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	What about Moliere?
L585758	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
L585757	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
L585756	u8230	m559	RICHARD	What happened?
L585755	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	She is gone!
L585753	u8230	m559	RICHARD	A bit fucking late.
L585752	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	I'm sorry.
L585751	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
L585750	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
L585749	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
L585748	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Yes.
L585747	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Big?
L585746	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
L585745	u8230	m559	RICHARD	A shark fin?
L585744	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	A fin!
L585743	u8230	m559	RICHARD	What!
L585742	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Richard - I saw a fin!
L585741	u8230	m559	RICHARD	I think we're about half way.
L585740	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	We're ok.
L585739	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Everyone ok?
L585729	u8230	m559	RICHARD	I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
L585728	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	So how many miles do you think it is?
L585727	u8230	m559	RICHARD	We think in miles, not kilometers.
L585726	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	So?
L585725	u8230	m559	RICHARD	I don't know - I'm American.
L585680	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
L585679	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
L585675	u8230	m559	RICHARD	"We're going to swim ""one or two kilometers"" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?"
L585674	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Why?
L585673	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
L585672	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	One or two kilometers.
L585671	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
L585664	u8230	m559	RICHARD	That's the wrong one.
L585663	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
L585662	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	There is one problem.
L585661	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Nice work.
L585660	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
L585639	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
L585638	u8230	m559	RICHARD	It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
L585631	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	We moved rooms because of him.
L585630	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
L585629	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
L585628	u8230	m559	RICHARD	The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
L585624	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Good morning.
L585623	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Bonjour.
L585724	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	Richard?
L585723	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Two.
L585722	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	One kilometer
L585670	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	You can swim?
L585669	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
L585637	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
L585636	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	But he has been there, off course.
L585635	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	It's on an island that no one get to.
L585634	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
L585633	u8228	m559	ETIENNE	What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
L585632	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	He tried to borrow money from us.
L585731	u8230	m559	RICHARD	If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don?t try then we'll never know.
L585730	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Too far?
L585719	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	It's just the sky, Richard.
L585718	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
L585717	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
L585716	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Richard, you know something -
L585715	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Exactly.
L585714	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
L585713	u8230	m559	RICHARD	There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
L585712	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Incredible.
L585711	u8230	m559	RICHARD	You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
L585708	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	One night I will get the perfect photograph.
L585707	u8230	m559	RICHARD	I think so too.
L585706	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
L585705	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Francoise -
L585678	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
L585677	u8230	m559	RICHARD	No.
L585676	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Have you told someone?
L585668	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Swim?
L585667	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	We swim.
L585666	u8230	m559	RICHARD	So from there to there?
L585654	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Hi there. Here, take a look.
L585653	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Hi.
L585627	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
L585626	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Not too bad.
L585625	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Did you sleep well?
L585591	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Eh - bonsoir.
L585590	u8229	m559	FRANCOISE	Bonsoir.
L585698	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Uh-huh.
L585697	u8231	m559	SAMMY	So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
L585696	u8230	m559	RICHARD	So?
L585695	u8231	m559	SAMMY	Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
L585694	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
L585693	u8231	m559	SAMMY	"Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"""
L585683	u8230	m559	RICHARD	Where did you lose it?
L585682	u8231	m559	SAMMY	We lost our key.
L587454	u8257	m561	BONITA	... You take care of yourself, Johana.
L587453	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
L587452	u8257	m561	BONITA	Did you tell him?
L587451	u8257	m561	BONITA	I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
L587450	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
L587448	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Of course.
L587447	u8257	m561	BONITA	Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
L587446	u8262	m561	JOHANA	You're leaving?
L587415	u8257	m561	BONITA	Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
L587414	u8262	m561	JOHANA	And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
L587413	u8257	m561	BONITA	Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
L587412	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
L587411	u8257	m561	BONITA	But your man isn't quite a God!
L587410	u8262	m561	JOHANA	"I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan ""You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee""?"
L587409	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I can't... I just don't know how to...
L587408	u8257	m561	BONITA	Maybe you should talk to him about it.
L587407	u8262	m561	JOHANA	No.
L587406	u8257	m561	BONITA	Does he know?
L587405	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Yes.
L587404	u8257	m561	BONITA	Are you going to keep it?
L587403	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
L587402	u8257	m561	BONITA	I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
L587401	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Yes.  Not like Enzo.
L587400	u8257	m561	BONITA	He's shy, not like Enzo.
L587399	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
L587398	u8257	m561	BONITA	You're going to live here permanently?
L587318	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
L587317	u8258	m561	DUFFY	He seems to have won it.
L587316	u8262	m561	JOHANA	No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
L587315	u8258	m561	DUFFY	The Italian, I presume?
L587314	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
L587313	u8258	m561	DUFFY	You're right.  You're fired.
L587312	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
L587311	u8258	m561	DUFFY	Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
L587310	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
L587309	u8258	m561	DUFFY	Good afternoon.
L586922	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Italian is practically the same thing.
L586921	u8258	m561	DUFFY	I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
L586920	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
L586919	u8258	m561	DUFFY	I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
L586918	u8262	m561	JOHANA	We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
L586917	u8258	m561	DUFFY	It can't be true!
L586916	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
L586915	u8258	m561	DUFFY	No!
L586914	u8262	m561	JOHANA	The documents are forged.
L586913	u8258	m561	DUFFY	What's happened??
L586912	u8262	m561	JOHANA	The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
L586911	u8258	m561	DUFFY	What d'you mean?
L586910	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
L586900	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... So am I.
L586899	u8258	m561	DUFFY	My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
L586898	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
L586897	u8258	m561	DUFFY	Did the driver really freeze?
L586895	u8258	m561	DUFFY	I said that the file is incomplete.
L586894	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
L586893	u8258	m561	DUFFY	Johana, am I boring you?
L586892	u8262	m561	JOHANA	What kind?
L586891	u8258	m561	DUFFY	This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
L587514	u8259	m561	ENZO	The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
L587513	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Is he alright?  What happened?
L587512	u8259	m561	ENZO	That idiot!
L587511	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Five minutes and fifty seconds.
L587510	u8259	m561	ENZO	Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
L587509	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Why?
L587508	u8259	m561	ENZO	Don't.
L587507	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... Not yet.
L587506	u8259	m561	ENZO	You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
L587505	u8262	m561	JOHANA	How do you know that?
L587504	u8259	m561	ENZO	You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
L587503	u8262	m561	JOHANA	He can learn.  He is learning.
L587502	u8259	m561	ENZO	No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
L587501	u8262	m561	JOHANA	A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
L587500	u8259	m561	ENZO	I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
L587499	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I won't, I swear.

L587320	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Hello?
L587237	u8261	m561	JACQUES	But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
L587236	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
L587235	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
L587234	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
L587233	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Why?
L587232	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I'm going back home.
L587211	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
L587210	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I did?
L587209	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Jacques, you set a world record.
L587192	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Uh... Yes, of course!
L587191	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
L587131	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I don't know, I just feel it.
L587130	u8262	m561	JOHANA	How do you know that?
L587129	u8261	m561	JACQUES	She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
L587122	u8261	m561	JACQUES	... The way she moves.
L587121	u8262	m561	JOHANA	How can you tell it's a female?
L587116	u8262	m561	JOHANA	No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
L587115	u8261	m561	JACQUES	... No?
L587114	u8261	m561	JACQUES	You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
L587113	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I'd better get back now.
L587112	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
L587111	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
L587098	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Give it to me.
L587097	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
L587096	u8261	m561	JACQUES	No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
L587094	u8261	m561	JACQUES	My wallet.
L587093	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Only to help the medics, I assure you.
L587092	u8261	m561	JACQUES	You jumped in?
L587091	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Lucky I was there to save you.
L587090	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
L587033	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... Especially the sneakers.
L587032	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Thank you...
L587031	u8262	m561	JOHANA	You look adorable.
L587030	u8261	m561	JACQUES	It's too loud for me.
L587029	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I thought you'd be at the dinner.
L587018	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
L587017	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
L587016	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
L587015	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
L587014	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I don't know... why?
L587013	u8262	m561	JOHANA	You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
L587012	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
L587011	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
L587010	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
L586988	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... Okay.  I'll try.
L586987	u8261	m561	JACQUES	No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
L586983	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
L586982	u8261	m561	JACQUES	But what brought you to Sicily?
L586976	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
L586975	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Please, have a seat.
L586834	u8262	m561	JOHANA	No... in the hut.
L586833	u8261	m561	JACQUES	In the lake?
L586832	u8262	m561	JOHANA	We saw each other a little while ago.
L586831	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I recognize you.
L586931	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Ah?!
L586930	u8266	m561	RECEPTIONIST	No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
L586929	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
L586928	u8266	m561	RECEPTIONIST	Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
L586927	u8261	m561	JACQUES	This is the hotel San Domenico?
L586926	u8266	m561	RECEPTIONIST	Positive, Sir.
L586925	u8261	m561	JACQUES	... Are you sure?
L586924	u8266	m561	RECEPTIONIST	Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
L587425	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	That's different!  What's the matter with you?
L587424	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Louis, we were French!
L587423	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
L587422	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
L587421	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
L587378	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
L587377	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
L587376	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
L587375	u8261	m561	JACQUES	It's my apartment.
L587374	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	In my apartment?
L587373	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Well... here.
L587372	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
L587370	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
L587369	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Uncle Louis!
L587366	u8261	m561	JACQUES	He doesn't hear too well.
L587365	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
L587364	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Johana... New York.
L587363	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Where are you from, Henrietta?
L587358	u8261	m561	JACQUES	No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
L587357	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
L587356	u8261	m561	JACQUES	I brought Johana to meet you.
L587355	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
L587354	u8261	m561	JACQUES	Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
L587353	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Assassin!
L586755	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
L586754	u8261	m561	JACQUES	What?
L586753	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Why don't you ask me?
L586750	u8261	m561	JACQUES	No.
L586749	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
L586747	u8270	m561	UNCLE LOUIS	Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
L586746	u8261	m561	JACQUES	You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
L587303	u8268	m561	SALLY	Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
L587302	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
L587301	u8268	m561	SALLY	What is it honey... the frenchy?
L587300	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
L587299	u8268	m561	SALLY	You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
L587298	u8262	m561	JOHANA	No.  I'm just depressed.
L587297	u8268	m561	SALLY	Does that have a hidden meaning?
L587296	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Way past it.
L587295	u8268	m561	SALLY	... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
L586873	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
L586872	u8268	m561	SALLY	... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
L586871	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Haven't you been listening?
L586870	u8268	m561	SALLY	I thought you said he was Peruvian?
L586868	u8268	m561	SALLY	Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
L586867	u8262	m561	JOHANA	It's his heartbeat.
L586865	u8268	m561	SALLY	Okay... Who'd you meet?
L586864	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
L586863	u8268	m561	SALLY	How was your trip?
L586862	u8262	m561	JOHANA	What?
L586861	u8268	m561	SALLY	Well?
L586859	u8268	m561	SALLY	They're going to send detectives.
L586858	u8262	m561	JOHANA	You called the police?
L586857	u8268	m561	SALLY	Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
L586856	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
L586855	u8268	m561	SALLY	... And the new stereo.
L586854	u8268	m561	SALLY	They got the new T.V.
L586853	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Again?
L586852	u8268	m561	SALLY	You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
L586851	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... Sally?
L586850	u8268	m561	SALLY	I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
L587203	u8265	m561	NOVELLI	Yes... It's magic.
L587202	u8262	m561	JOHANA	But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
L587201	u8265	m561	NOVELLI	That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
L587200	u8262	m561	JOHANA	What's that little air bottle on the machine?
L587199	u8265	m561	NOVELLI	Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
L587198	u8262	m561	JOHANA	... And those?
L587197	u8265	m561	NOVELLI	Of course, that's what they're for.
L587196	u8262	m561	JOHANA	If there was a problem, they could do something right?
L587195	u8265	m561	NOVELLI	They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
L587194	u8262	m561	JOHANA	What are they for?
L587550	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	Let him sleep.
L587549	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I'll go see how he's doing.
L586907	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	... Yes?
L586906	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Wait!  Professor...?
L586905	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	Then, goodbye.
L586904	u8262	m561	JOHANA	You've made me a happy insurance person.
L586903	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
L586902	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
L586830	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
L586829	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Will he understand Spanish?
L586828	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	Coffee might be nice.
L586827	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
L586826	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
L586825	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Why is he doing this?
L586824	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
L586823	u8262	m561	JOHANA	How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
L586822	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
L586819	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	He isn't going to breathe.
L586818	u8262	m561	JOHANA	But... how is he going to breathe?
L586817	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
L586815	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	In the spring when he melts!
L586814	u8262	m561	JOHANA	I'll have to talk to the driver.
L586813	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
L586812	u8262	m561	JOHANA	That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
L586811	u8263	m561	LAWRENCE	Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
L586810	u8262	m561	JOHANA	Who... Who is that?
L610257	u8408	m570	EPPS	Nobody's going to hurt you.
L610256	u8407	m570	DRIVER	Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
L610255	u8408	m570	EPPS	Turn the car around.
L610254	u8407	m570	DRIVER	This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
L610253	u8408	m570	EPPS	What's in the other direction?
L610252	u8407	m570	DRIVER	Baghdad.
L610251	u8408	m570	EPPS	Where were you going?
L610250	u8407	m570	DRIVER	Y-yes.
L610249	u8408	m570	EPPS	You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
L610201	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
L610200	u8410	m570	WES	Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
L610198	u8408	m570	EPPS	If I give it to you, will you let us go?
L610197	u8410	m570	WES	Give it to me!
L610184	u8410	m570	WES	If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
L610183	u8408	m570	EPPS	So you can give us away?
L610182	u8410	m570	WES	I have to answer him.
L610181	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just keep quiet.
L610177	u8408	m570	EPPS	You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
L610176	u8410	m570	WES	They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
L610169	u8410	m570	WES	That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
L610168	u8408	m570	EPPS	That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
L610167	u8410	m570	WES	You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
L610164	u8408	m570	EPPS	Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
L610163	u8410	m570	WES	Thanks for taking care of this for me.
L610160	u8410	m570	WES	Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
L610159	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wes--
L610158	u8410	m570	WES	Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
L610157	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
L610152	u8408	m570	EPPS	We thought--
L610151	u8410	m570	WES	In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
L610009	u8410	m570	WES	Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
L610008	u8408	m570	EPPS	What about Jaeger?
L610007	u8410	m570	WES	Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
L610006	u8408	m570	EPPS	Suppose I don't go for that?
L610005	u8410	m570	WES	I'm the one's got the big stick.
L610004	u8408	m570	EPPS	And let me guess who is.
L610003	u8410	m570	WES	Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
L610002	u8408	m570	EPPS	Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
L610001	u8410	m570	WES	No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
L609978	u8410	m570	WES	What if I do?
L609977	u8408	m570	EPPS	We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
L609976	u8410	m570	WES	In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
L609975	u8408	m570	EPPS	I out rank you, that's why.
L609974	u8410	m570	WES	You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
L609961	u8410	m570	WES	Get out of my way.
L609960	u8408	m570	EPPS	No.
L609959	u8410	m570	WES	Then step aside.
L609958	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
L609957	u8410	m570	WES	It's a combat action.
L609956	u8408	m570	EPPS	I've got no stomach for murder.
L609955	u8410	m570	WES	I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
L609953	u8410	m570	WES	He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
L609952	u8408	m570	EPPS	We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
L609951	u8410	m570	WES	We're at war.
L609950	u8408	m570	EPPS	I'm not going to let you kill him.
L609949	u8410	m570	WES	He's an enemy soldier.
L609948	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're out of your mind.
L609944	u8410	m570	WES	You don't know he isn't.
L609943	u8408	m570	EPPS	You don't know that.
L609942	u8410	m570	WES	That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
L609941	u8408	m570	EPPS	You said he was a deserter.
L609940	u8410	m570	WES	We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
L609938	u8408	m570	EPPS	Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
L609937	u8410	m570	WES	I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
L609932	u8410	m570	WES	He...he could have been watching us.
L609931	u8408	m570	EPPS	How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
L609930	u8410	m570	WES	Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
L609929	u8408	m570	EPPS	Why'd he come in our camp.
L609928	u8410	m570	WES	Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
L609924	u8410	m570	WES	I told you; don't push me around.
L609923	u8408	m570	EPPS	Stop it!
L609919	u8410	m570	WES	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
L609918	u8408	m570	EPPS	What happened?
L609917	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get off him!
L609916	u8410	m570	WES	He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
L609915	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get off him.
L609910	u8408	m570	EPPS	Then get up and do something about it.
L609909	u8410	m570	WES	You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
L609907	u8408	m570	EPPS	I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
L609906	u8410	m570	WES	You got no reason to do that!
L609905	u8410	m570	WES	Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
L609904	u8408	m570	EPPS	Maybe I do.
L609903	u8410	m570	WES	Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
L609902	u8408	m570	EPPS	You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
L609901	u8410	m570	WES	You're the one with all the ideas.
L609898	u8410	m570	WES	What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
L609897	u8408	m570	EPPS	We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
L609896	u8410	m570	WES	Maybe we should split it up now.
L609895	u8408	m570	EPPS	What about it?
L609894	u8410	m570	WES	What about the gold?
L609893	u8408	m570	EPPS	It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
L609874	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
L609873	u8410	m570	WES	You ready?
L609866	u8410	m570	WES	Ready when you are.
L609865	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
L609832	u8408	m570	EPPS	I heard!
L609831	u8410	m570	WES	Epps!
L609820	u8408	m570	EPPS	Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
L609819	u8410	m570	WES	What am I supposed to do?
L609818	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
L609804	u8408	m570	EPPS	Move!
L609803	u8410	m570	WES	Missile!
L609800	u8408	m570	EPPS	So we wait.
L609799	u8410	m570	WES	And they can't fly around out there forever.
L609786	u8410	m570	WES	Weird they didn't chase us.
L609785	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
L609784	u8410	m570	WES	Where'd they go?
L609779	u8408	m570	EPPS	Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
L609778	u8410	m570	WES	Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
L609773	u8408	m570	EPPS	Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
L609772	u8410	m570	WES	What do you figure it to be?
L609771	u8408	m570	EPPS	Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
L609770	u8408	m570	EPPS	Let me see the map.
L609769	u8410	m570	WES	The US Army:  Always an adventure.
L609765	u8408	m570	EPPS	Picks up again just on the other side.
L609764	u8410	m570	WES	Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
L609763	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not much of a pass.
L609762	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
L609761	u8410	m570	WES	And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
L609760	u8408	m570	EPPS	All we've got to do is make it to the top.
L609758	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
L609757	u8410	m570	WES	We can't just go off and--
L609756	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
L609746	u8410	m570	WES	We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
L609745	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's nothing we can do.
L609742	u8410	m570	WES	The soldiers are going to kill those people!
L609741	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  Let's get out of here.
L609692	u8410	m570	WES	Yeah.
L609691	u8408	m570	EPPS	Ready?
L609690	u8410	m570	WES	Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
L609689	u8408	m570	EPPS	You just go when I say go.
L609688	u8410	m570	WES	What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
L609676	u8408	m570	EPPS	Break it out.
L609675	u8410	m570	WES	For climbing.
L609674	u8408	m570	EPPS	We've got rope?
L609666	u8408	m570	EPPS	Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
L609665	u8410	m570	WES	Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
L609664	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
L609663	u8410	m570	WES	What kind of mine?
L609631	u8408	m570	EPPS	How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
L609630	u8410	m570	WES	He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
L609629	u8408	m570	EPPS	He's not so--
L609628	u8410	m570	WES	Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
L609627	u8408	m570	EPPS	Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
L609599	u8410	m570	WES	Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
L609598	u8408	m570	EPPS	You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
L609588	u8408	m570	EPPS	Low on gas.  Got to refill.
L609587	u8410	m570	WES	What are you doing.
L609569	u8408	m570	EPPS	They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
L609568	u8410	m570	WES	Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
L609567	u8408	m570	EPPS	This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
L609566	u8410	m570	WES	We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
L609565	u8408	m570	EPPS	They shouldn't have been here.
L609541	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
L609540	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wha...
L609539	u8410	m570	WES	They stopped.
L609528	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're going to keep driving.
L609527	u8410	m570	WES	What are we going to do!?
L609488	u8410	m570	WES	No, please, not again.
L609487	u8408	m570	EPPS	Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
L609484	u8410	m570	WES	I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
L609483	u8408	m570	EPPS	I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
L609482	u8410	m570	WES	What?
L609479	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, God.
L609478	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
L609457	u8408	m570	EPPS	I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
L609456	u8410	m570	WES	You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
L609433	u8408	m570	EPPS	Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
L609432	u8410	m570	WES	Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
L609431	u8408	m570	EPPS	A casual one.
L609399	u8408	m570	EPPS	There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
L609398	u8410	m570	WES	It's a map, I think that's what it is.
L609395	u8408	m570	EPPS	Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
L609394	u8410	m570	WES	What's it say?
L609393	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's a fortune box.
L609392	u8410	m570	WES	Paper.
L609334	u8408	m570	EPPS	Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
L609333	u8410	m570	WES	Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
L609317	u8410	m570	WES	I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
L609316	u8408	m570	EPPS	Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
L609308	u8408	m570	EPPS	You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
L609307	u8410	m570	WES	...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
L609300	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
L609299	u8410	m570	WES	Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
L610246	u8408	m570	EPPS	He's going to slow down.
L610245	u8409	m570	JAEGER	He's not slowing.
L610244	u8408	m570	EPPS	He'll slow down.
L610243	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
L610241	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
L610240	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
L610239	u8408	m570	EPPS	That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
L610238	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Really?
L610237	u8408	m570	EPPS	I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
L610236	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What?
L610235	u8408	m570	EPPS	Australia.
L610234	u8408	m570	EPPS	How the hell should I know?
L610233	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
L610232	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know.
L610231	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
L610230	u8408	m570	EPPS	Thought you were going to buy a car.
L610229	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm thinking about taking a trip.
L610228	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L610227	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps?
L610226	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
L610225	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
L610224	u8408	m570	EPPS	Threatened to blow my brains out?
L610223	u8409	m570	JAEGER	This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
L610222	u8408	m570	EPPS	Thanks.
L610221	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
L610220	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah.
L610219	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps.
L610218	u8408	m570	EPPS	Then I'm a rich man.
L610217	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
L610216	u8408	m570	EPPS	Somebody has to.
L610215	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why do I have to lie in the road?
L610214	u8408	m570	EPPS	You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
L610213	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How do we do that?
L610212	u8408	m570	EPPS	A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
L610211	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Well?
L610210	u8408	m570	EPPS	You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
L610209	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
L610208	u8408	m570	EPPS	We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
L610207	u8409	m570	JAEGER	But...
L610206	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
L610205	u8409	m570	JAEGER	When did you make the switch?
L610204	u8408	m570	EPPS	It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
L610203	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The...the gold...
L610202	u8408	m570	EPPS	Damn it.  We lost the horses.
L610194	u8408	m570	EPPS	We go this way.
L610193	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Which way do we go!?
L610179	u8408	m570	EPPS	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
L610178	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Can you ride a horse?
L610166	u8408	m570	EPPS	Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
L610165	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I didn't say that.  I never said--
L610150	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
L610149	u8408	m570	EPPS	...Wes...?
L610147	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
L610146	u8408	m570	EPPS	You come up with a better plan, let me know.
L610145	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We can't just sit here waiting to die.
L610144	u8408	m570	EPPS	With what?  Against how many?
L610143	u8409	m570	JAEGER	...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
L610142	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know!
L610141	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why haven't they killed us!?
L610140	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't know.  They killed Wes.
L610139	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Is that good, or bad?
L610138	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shi'ites, I think.
L610137	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do you make of them?
L610134	u8408	m570	EPPS	We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
L610133	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do we do?
L610130	u8408	m570	EPPS	Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
L610129	u8409	m570	JAEGER	To where?
L610128	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
L610127	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do we do?
L610124	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
L610123	u8408	m570	EPPS	An Iraqi?
L610119	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shoot them!
L610118	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I just said I would.  I don't think I--
L610117	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
L610116	u8408	m570	EPPS	I don't have a weapon.
L610115	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Can't you--
L610114	u8408	m570	EPPS	Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
L610113	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
L610112	u8408	m570	EPPS	And then shoot them.
L610111	u8409	m570	JAEGER	And then what?
L610110	u8408	m570	EPPS	Slip out your M-16.
L610109	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are we going to do?
L610108	u8408	m570	EPPS	They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
L610107	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh, God...
L610105	u8408	m570	EPPS	They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
L610104	u8409	m570	JAEGER	"I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means ""Don't shoot. We're your friends."""
L610103	u8408	m570	EPPS	What did you say?
L610100	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Probably.
L610099	u8408	m570	EPPS	That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
L610098	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
L610097	u8408	m570	EPPS	Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
L610096	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, I guess we should.
L610095	u8408	m570	EPPS	Well, we should identify ourselves.
L610094	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Well?
L610091	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
L610090	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
L610087	u8408	m570	EPPS	Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
L610086	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
L610085	u8408	m570	EPPS	Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
L610084	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do you figure it is?
L610081	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
L610080	u8408	m570	EPPS	The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
L610079	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
L610078	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't you touch it.
L610077	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
L610076	u8408	m570	EPPS	We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
L610075	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just let me rest for a second.
L610074	u8408	m570	EPPS	No!
L610073	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
L610072	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
L610071	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Getting cold.
L610070	u8408	m570	EPPS	Okay.  Then we go this way.
L610069	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I pick that way.
L610068	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You sure you want me too?
L610067	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
L610065	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's got to be going better than this..
L610064	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wonder how the war's going?
L610063	u8408	m570	EPPS	If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
L610062	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What do you think our chances are?
L610061	u8408	m570	EPPS	Damn.
L610060	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Sorry.
L610058	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
L610057	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
L610056	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
L610055	u8408	m570	EPPS	Makes two of us.
L610054	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't want to die.
L610053	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah.
L610052	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps?
L610051	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What?  Yeah.
L610050	u8408	m570	EPPS	You still got a map on you?
L610049	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
L610048	u8408	m570	EPPS	Sure.
L610047	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
L610046	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah.  Well, me too.
L610045	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
L610043	u8408	m570	EPPS	Is it all right if I stand up?
L610042	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm sorry about that, Epps.
L610039	u8408	m570	EPPS	That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
L610038	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
L610037	u8408	m570	EPPS	And you; you've got it all together.
L610036	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
L610035	u8408	m570	EPPS	First Wes, now you?
L610031	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They'll search the pack.
L610030	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll lie.
L610029	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
L610028	u8408	m570	EPPS	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
L610027	u8409	m570	JAEGER	No.
L610026	u8408	m570	EPPS	We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
L610025	u8409	m570	JAEGER	No.
L610019	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
L610018	u8408	m570	EPPS	What if he's not?
L610017	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wes is dead!
L610016	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can't just leave him.
L610015	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Forget Wes.
L610014	u8408	m570	EPPS	We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
L610000	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll find our way!  We'll...
L609999	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How!?
L609998	u8408	m570	EPPS	We'll find our way.
L609997	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
L609973	u8408	m570	EPPS	You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
L609972	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
L609971	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
L609970	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
L609969	u8408	m570	EPPS	We should head Northeast.
L609900	u8408	m570	EPPS	It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
L609899	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wes might be right about that.
L609891	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
L609890	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
L609889	u8408	m570	EPPS	What the hell took so long.
L609882	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
L609881	u8408	m570	EPPS	All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
L609878	u8408	m570	EPPS	Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
L609877	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't see how that plan's any better.
L609876	u8408	m570	EPPS	Jesus, Jaeger.
L609875	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why do I have to stay down here?
L609872	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
L609871	u8408	m570	EPPS	He's not going to leave us.
L609870	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
L609869	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609868	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609867	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wait.
L609862	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
L609861	u8408	m570	EPPS	I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
L609860	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
L609853	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
L609852	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Is it dead?
L609851	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's just a mongoose.
L609848	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's giving.
L609847	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
L609845	u8408	m570	EPPS	I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
L609844	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Must be a compartment.
L609840	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get up off your ass and dig!
L609839	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
L609838	u8408	m570	EPPS	Get up and dig.
L609837	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
L609836	u8408	m570	EPPS	It looks like you're not doing anything.
L609835	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?
L609834	u8408	m570	EPPS	What are you doing?
L609828	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So where do we start?
L609827	u8408	m570	EPPS	A whole lot of nothing.
L609822	u8408	m570	EPPS	Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
L609821	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Think there might be more Iraqis?
L609802	u8408	m570	EPPS	If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
L609801	u8409	m570	JAEGER	If they land--
L609798	u8408	m570	EPPS	They can't shoot us in here.
L609797	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They're going to kill us!
L609796	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're not going to do anything.
L609795	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
L609794	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just stay down.
L609793	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Where the hell is it!?
L609792	u8408	m570	EPPS	Stay low.
L609791	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Where is it?  Where'd it go?
L609777	u8408	m570	EPPS	I hope it means something, otherwise...
L609776	u8409	m570	JAEGER	But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
L609775	u8408	m570	EPPS	Something like that.
L609774	u8409	m570	JAEGER	X marks the spot.
L609751	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
L609750	u8408	m570	EPPS	Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
L609738	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
L609737	u8408	m570	EPPS	They're doing more than slapping.
L609733	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
L609732	u8408	m570	EPPS	Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
L609731	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are they doing here?
L609730	u8408	m570	EPPS	Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
L609727	u8408	m570	EPPS	Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
L609726	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's a fire fight.
L609725	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't!
L609723	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shut up and listen!
L609722	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't hear any--
L609718	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
L609717	u8408	m570	EPPS	I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
L609714	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
L609713	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're not losing trust, are you?
L609709	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's the treasure, that's what it is.
L609708	u8408	m570	EPPS	This.  Whatever it is.
L609705	u8408	m570	EPPS	If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
L609704	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
L609703	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
L609702	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're going to blow yourselves up.
L609687	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
L609686	u8408	m570	EPPS	When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
L609685	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
L609684	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're going to be fine.
L609683	u8409	m570	JAEGER	That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
L609682	u8408	m570	EPPS	Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
L609681	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How's this going to work?
L609680	u8408	m570	EPPS	It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
L609679	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
L609678	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
L609677	u8409	m570	JAEGER	My leg is falling asleep.
L609673	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
L609672	u8408	m570	EPPS	I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
L609670	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps...
L609669	u8408	m570	EPPS	There's a way.
L609662	u8408	m570	EPPS	I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
L609661	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
L609660	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're going to be right over here.
L609659	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Why you got to move away to talk!?
L609658	u8408	m570	EPPS	Me and Wes are just going to talk.
L609657	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Where you going?
L609656	u8408	m570	EPPS	We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
L609655	u8409	m570	JAEGER	How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
L609654	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just relax.
L609653	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's a mine, isn't it?
L609652	u8408	m570	EPPS	Just be cool.
L609651	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh, God!  Oh God!
L609647	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I heard it.
L609646	u8408	m570	EPPS	If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
L609645	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I heard it click.
L609644	u8408	m570	EPPS	You didn't step on any mine.
L609642	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Mine.  Land mine!
L609641	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609640	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Mine.
L609639	u8408	m570	EPPS	What!?
L609622	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
L609621	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
L609620	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
L609619	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
L609618	u8408	m570	EPPS	Faster we get there, faster we get back.
L609617	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
L609616	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I got that...sir.
L609615	u8408	m570	EPPS	SAY IT!
L609604	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We leave it.
L609603	u8408	m570	EPPS	What do we do with the Humvee?
L609593	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
L609592	u8408	m570	EPPS	And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
L609591	u8409	m570	JAEGER	...I know.
L609590	u8408	m570	EPPS	Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
L609582	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Millionaires, man.
L609581	u8408	m570	EPPS	It'd make their heads explode.
L609580	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
L609579	u8408	m570	EPPS	You can't tell anybody about this.
L609578	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
L609577	u8408	m570	EPPS	What?
L609576	u8408	m570	EPPS	Let's go.
L609575	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
L609574	u8408	m570	EPPS	She okay?
L609547	u8408	m570	EPPS	I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
L609546	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Steady it out!
L609538	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
L609537	u8408	m570	EPPS	Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
L609532	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's the only way.  We drive!
L609531	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They're not going to--
L609530	u8408	m570	EPPS	We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
L609529	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They'll shoot us!
L609525	u8408	m570	EPPS	We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
L609524	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
L609523	u8408	m570	EPPS	Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
L609517	u8408	m570	EPPS	TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
L609516	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wh-what do you think--
L609515	u8408	m570	EPPS	Take the binoculars.
L609513	u8408	m570	EPPS	You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
L609512	u8409	m570	JAEGER	And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
L609511	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
L609510	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh, that's fun.
L609509	u8408	m570	EPPS	Invest it.
L609508	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
L609507	u8408	m570	EPPS	You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
L609504	u8408	m570	EPPS	A car?  You're going to buy a car?
L609503	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
L609502	u8408	m570	EPPS	Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
L609499	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
L609498	u8408	m570	EPPS	But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
L609481	u8408	m570	EPPS	Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
L609480	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
L609473	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Roger that.
L609472	u8408	m570	EPPS	Now this is war.
L609470	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
L609469	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
L609462	u8408	m570	EPPS	But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
L609461	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
L609460	u8408	m570	EPPS	It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
L609447	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
L609446	u8408	m570	EPPS	And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
L609443	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
L609442	u8408	m570	EPPS	Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
L609441	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
L609440	u8408	m570	EPPS	I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
L609439	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Wait.  Wait.
L609438	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
L609426	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
L609425	u8408	m570	EPPS	Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
L609424	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
L609401	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
L609400	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You think?
L609386	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I did it!  I got the box open.
L609385	u8408	m570	EPPS	What!?  What!?
L609384	u8409	m570	JAEGER	OH MY GOD!
L609383	u8408	m570	EPPS	You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
L609380	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
L609379	u8408	m570	EPPS	Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
L609378	u8409	m570	JAEGER	This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
L609343	u8409	m570	JAEGER	There might be.
L609342	u8408	m570	EPPS	Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
L609341	u8409	m570	JAEGER	There might be something in there.
L609340	u8408	m570	EPPS	Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
L609327	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
L609326	u8408	m570	EPPS	Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
L609298	u8408	m570	EPPS	Another month in this desert and I might just.
L609297	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Blow me.
L609296	u8408	m570	EPPS	You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
L609294	u8408	m570	EPPS	No you're not.
L609293	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
L609292	u8408	m570	EPPS	Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
L609291	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
L609290	u8408	m570	EPPS	Knock it off!
L609289	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
L609282	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
L609281	u8408	m570	EPPS	What are you doing?
L609280	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
L609416	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
L609415	u8411	m570	WOODS	They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
L609414	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Some good ones.
L609413	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The photos.
L609412	u8411	m570	WOODS	Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
L609411	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Just...want to be ready when we do.
L609410	u8411	m570	WOODS	Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
L609409	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I could use some recon photos too.
L609408	u8411	m570	WOODS	That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
L609405	u8411	m570	WOODS	A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
L609404	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
L609403	u8411	m570	WOODS	Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
L609402	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Woods.
L610156	u8410	m570	WES	You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
L610155	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
L610154	u8410	m570	WES	When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
L609988	u8410	m570	WES	Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
L609987	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
L609986	u8410	m570	WES	The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
L609985	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You're going to burn up in those.
L609967	u8410	m570	WES	You want to say some words?
L609966	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
L609946	u8410	m570	WES	He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
L609945	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
L609936	u8410	m570	WES	I'm not wasting my water on him.
L609935	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I think he wants something to drink.
L609934	u8410	m570	WES	All last night he could have been--
L609933	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe we should give him some water.
L609927	u8409	m570	JAEGER	He lived through that?
L609926	u8410	m570	WES	Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
L609921	u8410	m570	WES	He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
L609920	u8409	m570	JAEGER	With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
L609855	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I think we found something.
L609854	u8410	m570	WES	What the hell are you doing!?
L609825	u8410	m570	WES	What do you see?
L609824	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, we're down.
L609823	u8410	m570	WES	You down?
L609817	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Guess we know what the next stop is.
L609816	u8410	m570	WES	It's got a bottom.
L609812	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Lines up with the map and the photos.
L609811	u8410	m570	WES	What do you think?
L609788	u8410	m570	WES	Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
L609787	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
L609767	u8410	m570	WES	We make it, or we go back empty handed.
L609766	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Think we can make it?
L609755	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
L609754	u8410	m570	WES	You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
L609753	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
L609752	u8410	m570	WES	We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
L609744	u8410	m570	WES	We have to do something.
L609743	u8409	m570	JAEGER	So?
L609740	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
L609739	u8410	m570	WES	Is there anything you do know?
L609736	u8410	m570	WES	Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
L609735	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
L609720	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
L609719	u8410	m570	WES	I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
L609716	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
L609715	u8410	m570	WES	If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
L609701	u8410	m570	WES	You want to crawl, crawl.
L609700	u8409	m570	JAEGER	That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
L609699	u8410	m570	WES	Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
L609698	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
L609697	u8410	m570	WES	How long we going to keep this up.
L609668	u8410	m570	WES	Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
L609667	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps...
L609610	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
L609609	u8410	m570	WES	Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
L609608	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You have to go with us, Wes.
L609607	u8410	m570	WES	You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
L609602	u8409	m570	JAEGER	As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.
L609601	u8410	m570	WES	Then lets go back while we still can.
L609600	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
L609595	u8409	m570	JAEGER	...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
L609594	u8410	m570	WES	So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
L609561	u8410	m570	WES	We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
L609560	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
L609559	u8410	m570	WES	We have to go back.
L609558	u8410	m570	WES	We got to get out of here.
L609557	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, well, we're not.
L609556	u8410	m570	WES	I thought we were dead.
L609536	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
L609535	u8410	m570	WES	I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
L609534	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah!  Yeah!
L609522	u8409	m570	JAEGER	They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
L609521	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, Jesus!
L609520	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
L609519	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, God!
L609518	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Iraqis.
L609506	u8409	m570	JAEGER	A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
L609505	u8410	m570	WES	This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
L609501	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my half?
L609500	u8410	m570	WES	If there's gold.  If!
L609497	u8410	m570	WES	How the hell should I know how much?
L609496	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
L609495	u8410	m570	WES	I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
L609494	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
L609493	u8410	m570	WES	If!  If there's a treasure.
L609492	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
L609486	u8410	m570	WES	Oh, no.
L609485	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Epps, is that a sand dune.
L609475	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
L609474	u8410	m570	WES	We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
L609468	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yes!
L609467	u8410	m570	WES	God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
L609465	u8410	m570	WES	You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
L609464	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
L609463	u8410	m570	WES	Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
L609454	u8410	m570	WES	So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
L609453	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
L609452	u8410	m570	WES	It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
L609451	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
L609450	u8410	m570	WES	You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
L609449	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
L609448	u8410	m570	WES	You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
L609436	u8409	m570	JAEGER	With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.
L609435	u8410	m570	WES	What?
L609434	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We...we could go home with something else.
L609430	u8410	m570	WES	Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
L609429	u8409	m570	JAEGER	That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
L609390	u8410	m570	WES	It's a container.  Break the seal.
L609389	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
L609382	u8409	m570	JAEGER	You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
L609381	u8410	m570	WES	The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
L609376	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
L609375	u8410	m570	WES	This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
L609374	u8409	m570	JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
L609371	u8409	m570	JAEGER	The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
L609370	u8410	m570	WES	You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
L609369	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
L609368	u8410	m570	WES	You ever think about dying?
L609367	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What!?
L609366	u8410	m570	WES	Jaeger?
L609364	u8410	m570	WES	Why would they do all that if we weren't?
L609363	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It doesn't mean anything.
L609362	u8410	m570	WES	We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
L609361	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
L609360	u8410	m570	WES	They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
L609359	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Like I said; so?
L609358	u8410	m570	WES	That's in two days.
L609357	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah.  So?
L609356	u8410	m570	WES	You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
L609355	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What?
L609354	u8410	m570	WES	Jaeger?
L609353	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
L609352	u8410	m570	WES	You really think there's a treasure inside?
L609351	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
L609350	u8410	m570	WES	You will.  You'll get it.
L609349	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Naw, nothing.
L609348	u8410	m570	WES	You get it yet?
L609345	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I could.
L609344	u8410	m570	WES	And you're the guy who's going to open it.
L609339	u8409	m570	JAEGER	For real?  A treasure?
L609338	u8410	m570	WES	It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
L609337	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Yeah, you're funny.
L609336	u8410	m570	WES	He says it's a box.
L609332	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
L609331	u8410	m570	WES	Now you need me.
L609330	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What is this?
L609325	u8410	m570	WES	Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
L609324	u8409	m570	JAEGER	"How do you say ""Come here, baby.  I'm horny.""  I can use that now."
L609323	u8410	m570	WES	Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
L609322	u8409	m570	JAEGER	What does that mean?
L609319	u8410	m570	WES	I thought it would be good to know.
L609318	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Spanish wasn't hard enough?
L609315	u8410	m570	WES	I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
L609314	u8409	m570	JAEGER	It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
L609313	u8410	m570	WES	Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
L609311	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Oh yeah.  Accidently.
L609310	u8410	m570	WES	I'm saying don't do it accidently.
L609309	u8409	m570	JAEGER	When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
L609304	u8410	m570	WES	People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
L609303	u8409	m570	JAEGER	People are suffering.
L609302	u8410	m570	WES	I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
L609301	u8409	m570	JAEGER	We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
L609288	u8409	m570	JAEGER	Okay.
L609287	u8410	m570	WES	Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
L609286	u8409	m570	JAEGER	I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
L609285	u8410	m570	WES	Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
L609284	u8409	m570	JAEGER	A headache?
L609283	u8410	m570	WES	Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
L617630	u8509	m577	M	GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
L617629	u8499	m577	ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	It's too late -
L617614	u8509	m577	M	Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
L617613	u8499	m577	ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
L617607	u8499	m577	ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
L617606	u8509	m577	M	But -
L617594	u8509	m577	M	What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
L617593	u8499	m577	ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
L617592	u8509	m577	M	... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
L618021	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
L618020	u8499	m577	ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
L618019	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
L618017	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
L618016	u8499	m577	ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
L618015	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
L617999	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	Admiral, are you suggesting -
L617998	u8499	m577	ADMIRAL ROEBUCK	Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
L617997	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
L618520	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
L618519	u8500	m577	BOND	I'd rather die alone.
L618508	u8500	m577	BOND	What about the gold?
L618507	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
L618494	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
L618493	u8500	m577	BOND	- Instant melt-down.
L618492	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
L618491	u8500	m577	BOND	...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
L618448	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
L618447	u8500	m577	BOND	Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
L618347	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Good-bye, Mister Bond.
L618346	u8500	m577	BOND	I'm sure they will.
L618335	u8500	m577	BOND	Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
L618334	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	...And what's that, my dear?
L618327	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
L618326	u8500	m577	BOND	Briefly.
L618321	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Your choice.  Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
L618320	u8500	m577	BOND	...Words to live by?
L618319	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
L618314	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
L618313	u8500	m577	BOND	Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
L618312	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	They're merely tools to disseminate information.
L618311	u8500	m577	BOND	...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
L618310	u8500	m577	BOND	And still not a thing to watch.
L618309	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
L618308	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow?  In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but...  I turned it into this
L618307	u8500	m577	BOND	So why did you leave?
L618306	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
L618305	u8500	m577	BOND	Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
L618304	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	I call this the Rogue's gallery.
L618303	u8500	m577	BOND	Sightseeing.
L618302	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
L618301	u8500	m577	BOND	I can feel your pain.
L618300	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
L618299	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
L618298	u8500	m577	BOND	I wonder if it runs in the family.
L618297	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
L618296	u8500	m577	BOND	I see.
L618295	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
L618289	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
L618288	u8500	m577	BOND	Sir Elliot.
L618287	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
L618279	u8500	m577	BOND	I'm on my way.
L618278	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
L618277	u8500	m577	BOND	How did you get this number?
L617874	u8500	m577	BOND	We'll see about that.
L617873	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
L617872	u8500	m577	BOND	Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
L617871	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
L617854	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
L617853	u8500	m577	BOND	It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
L617851	u8500	m577	BOND	You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
L617850	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
L618135	u8501	m577	CAPTAIN CHEONG	Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
L618134	u8500	m577	BOND	Where can I find him?
L618133	u8501	m577	CAPTAIN CHEONG	Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
L618132	u8500	m577	BOND	I appreciate your time -
L618131	u8501	m577	CAPTAIN CHEONG	Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
L618130	u8500	m577	BOND	Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
L618129	u8501	m577	CAPTAIN CHEONG	The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
L618128	u8500	m577	BOND	I'm sorry.
L618127	u8501	m577	CAPTAIN CHEONG	Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
L618126	u8500	m577	BOND	I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
L618125	u8501	m577	CAPTAIN CHEONG	In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
L617706	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
L617705	u8500	m577	BOND	What - no lust for adventure?
L617704	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	Not all of us, 007.
L617703	u8500	m577	BOND	- We all want what we can't have?
L617702	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
L617701	u8500	m577	BOND	Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
L617700	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
L617699	u8500	m577	BOND	In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
L617698	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
L617697	u8500	m577	BOND	Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
L617663	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
L617662	u8500	m577	BOND	Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
L617661	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	Four o'clock. Don't be late.
L617660	u8500	m577	BOND	4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
L617659	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
L617658	u8500	m577	BOND	Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
L617657	u8511	m577	MONEYPENNY	I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
L618181	u8514	m577	Q	Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
L618180	u8500	m577	BOND	I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
L618179	u8514	m577	Q	Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
L618178	u8500	m577	BOND	... 17 Beverage cup holders?
L618177	u8514	m577	Q	Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
L618176	u8500	m577	BOND	- Four wheel drive?
L618175	u8514	m577	Q	Your new car. 
L618174	u8514	m577	Q	I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
L618173	u8500	m577	BOND	Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
L618172	u8514	m577	Q	Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
L618171	u8500	m577	BOND	Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
L618170	u8514	m577	Q	That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
L618169	u8500	m577	BOND	I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
L618168	u8514	m577	Q	Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
L618167	u8500	m577	BOND	Q! How are you?
L618268	u8500	m577	BOND	I know what I saw -
L618267	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
L618266	u8500	m577	BOND	Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
L618265	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
L618264	u8500	m577	BOND	...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
L618263	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
L618262	u8500	m577	BOND	Don't you think you're overreacting?
L618245	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
L618244	u8500	m577	BOND	Wait a minute -
L618243	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
L618242	u8500	m577	BOND	Yes -
L617865	u8500	m577	BOND	One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
L617864	u8513	m577	PARIS	Just - say it. Say it just once.
L617862	u8513	m577	PARIS	He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
L617861	u8500	m577	BOND	Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
L617860	u8513	m577	PARIS	Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
L617859	u8500	m577	BOND	Paris -
L617802	u8513	m577	PARIS	Just hold me.
L617801	u8500	m577	BOND	Shhhhh...
L617800	u8513	m577	PARIS	I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
L617799	u8513	m577	PARIS	It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
L617798	u8500	m577	BOND	What about the uranium?
L617797	u8500	m577	BOND	Do you?
L617796	u8513	m577	PARIS	Do you feel better now?
L617795	u8513	m577	PARIS	No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
L617794	u8500	m577	BOND	What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
L617793	u8500	m577	BOND	Nothing.
L617792	u8513	m577	PARIS	Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
L617791	u8500	m577	BOND	I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
L617790	u8513	m577	PARIS	Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
L617789	u8500	m577	BOND	Is this another one of your games?
L617788	u8513	m577	PARIS	Oh, James. I've missed you -
L617787	u8500	m577	BOND	I thought your specialty was good-bye.
L617786	u8513	m577	PARIS	Is that any way to say hello?
L617785	u8500	m577	BOND	Paris?!? What are you doing here?
L617740	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
L617739	u8500	m577	BOND	Political considerations?
L617738	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
L617726	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	"Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port ""Aberdeen Harbor"" in their honor?"
L617725	u8500	m577	BOND	Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
L617724	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
L617714	u8500	m577	BOND	Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
L617713	u8510	m577	MINISTER JOHNSTONE	His newspapers?
L617776	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	"I believe Q's exact words were:  ""Hopefully, nothing."""
L617775	u8500	m577	BOND	A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
L617774	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
L617773	u8500	m577	BOND	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
L617772	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
L617771	u8500	m577	BOND	I see...
L617770	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
L617769	u8500	m577	BOND	Does it work on cash machines?
L617768	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
L617767	u8500	m577	BOND	Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
L617766	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
L617765	u8500	m577	BOND	... Shoelaces?
L617762	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Not from forty feet.
L617761	u8500	m577	BOND	Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
L617759	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
L617758	u8500	m577	BOND	Fishing?
L617757	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Gone fishing.
L617756	u8500	m577	BOND	How is old Q?
L617755	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
L617753	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Well... If you insist.
L617752	u8500	m577	BOND	It must do something.
L617751	u8500	m577	BOND	Come on. I know better than that -
L617750	u8515	m577	SAUNDERS	Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
L617749	u8500	m577	BOND	Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
L618272	u8500	m577	BOND	I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
L618271	u8519	m577	WADE	Where to now, Jimbo?
L618205	u8519	m577	WADE	Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
L618204	u8500	m577	BOND	Sidney Winch, meet -
L618192	u8500	m577	BOND	That's reassuring.
L618191	u8519	m577	WADE	I got you covered.
L618186	u8500	m577	BOND	Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
L618185	u8519	m577	WADE	They'd never sail this close to the shore.
L618184	u8500	m577	BOND	Who knows? Fog, night...
L618183	u8519	m577	WADE	I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
L618162	u8500	m577	BOND	He tied one on.
L618161	u8519	m577	WADE	Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
L618123	u8519	m577	WADE	Hell. The CIA built that club.
L618122	u8500	m577	BOND	Can you arrange a meeting?
L618121	u8519	m577	WADE	Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
L618120	u8500	m577	BOND	I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
L618113	u8500	m577	BOND	We work in the dark. We do what we can.
L618112	u8519	m577	WADE	I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
L618111	u8500	m577	BOND	She married a hockey player.
L618110	u8519	m577	WADE	Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
L618109	u8500	m577	BOND	Natalya?
L618107	u8500	m577	BOND	Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
L618106	u8519	m577	WADE	I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
L618104	u8519	m577	WADE	Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
L618103	u8500	m577	BOND	Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
L618102	u8519	m577	WADE	What do you want with the Harbor Master?
L618101	u8519	m577	WADE	Step into my office.
L618100	u8500	m577	BOND	Something with an engine? Not oars?
L618099	u8519	m577	WADE	I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
L618091	u8500	m577	BOND	Let's take a look at the body.
L618090	u8519	m577	WADE	Hey - the world is my office.
L618089	u8500	m577	BOND	That's reassuring.
L618088	u8519	m577	WADE	I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
L618087	u8500	m577	BOND	Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
L617696	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	You too.
L617695	u8500	m577	BOND	Thanks.  Take care -
L617694	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
L617693	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	I didn't think so.
L617692	u8500	m577	BOND	No.
L617691	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	Three. You? Married?
L617690	u8500	m577	BOND	... Kids?
L617689	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	Happily.
L617688	u8500	m577	BOND	Married?
L617687	u8500	m577	BOND	Depends what number you write.
L617686	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	... Does this do anything?
L617685	u8500	m577	BOND	Of course.
L617684	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
L617683	u8500	m577	BOND	They point, I shoot.
L617682	u8503	m577	DOMINIQUE	Interesting video tape.
L617681	u8500	m577	BOND	Interesting presentation.
L618571	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Now.
L618570	u8500	m577	BOND	And when might that be?
L618569	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
L618568	u8500	m577	BOND	And number two?
L618567	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
L618566	u8500	m577	BOND	... Yes?
L618565	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
L618564	u8500	m577	BOND	... Yes???
L618563	u8500	m577	BOND	I didn't say when I want to die -
L618562	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
L618482	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Next time, I do the driving.
L618481	u8500	m577	BOND	Sleep well?
L618463	u8500	m577	BOND	We blast through.
L618462	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	If not?
L618461	u8500	m577	BOND	If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
L618456	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
L618455	u8500	m577	BOND	Another reason??? Did I miss something???
L618454	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
L618453	u8500	m577	BOND	Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
L618438	u8500	m577	BOND	It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
L618437	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Is this - like - a normal day for you?
L618436	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Don't say it.
L618435	u8500	m577	BOND	Sometimes you just have to -
L618434	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	... We have time for that?
L618433	u8500	m577	BOND	Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
L618432	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Are you listening to me?
L618431	u8500	m577	BOND	Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
L618420	u8500	m577	BOND	Trust me.
L618419	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
L618407	u8500	m577	BOND	Up.
L618406	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Down?
L618401	u8500	m577	BOND	Cleans dirt. Let's go.
L618400	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	What the hell does that do?
L618396	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	What do you mean?
L618395	u8500	m577	BOND	Not a lot of difference.
L618393	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	My father left me the business.
L618392	u8500	m577	BOND	... How did you get into marine salvage?
L618379	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	No. I'm going with you.
L618378	u8500	m577	BOND	Wait here.
L618377	u8500	m577	BOND	The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
L618376	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	This has got to be a mistake.
L618362	u8500	m577	BOND	Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
L618361	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	You are seriously deranged.
L618360	u8500	m577	BOND	He's killed closer.
L618359	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	He was my father's best friend!
L618358	u8500	m577	BOND	Blood or Dutch?
L618357	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
L618356	u8500	m577	BOND	Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
L618354	u8500	m577	BOND	Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
L618353	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
L618352	u8500	m577	BOND	You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
L618351	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	What?
L618350	u8500	m577	BOND	... Do you have a gun?
L618342	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
L618341	u8500	m577	BOND	Why don't we just take these -
L618232	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	"Thank you.  ""Now hear this: Drop dead."""
L618231	u8500	m577	BOND	Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
L618230	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	- You're not.
L618229	u8500	m577	BOND	If I were you -
L618222	u8500	m577	BOND	- The family jewels?
L618221	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	And what do you call this?
L618219	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Think about mom.
L618218	u8500	m577	BOND	I hope you'll be gentle.
L618217	u8500	m577	BOND	I hope so.
L618216	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Do I have to do everything around here?
L618210	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
L618209	u8500	m577	BOND	No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
L618208	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	No?
L618207	u8500	m577	BOND	You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
L618206	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	- Shut up!
L618156	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Let's not make it a habit.
L618155	u8500	m577	BOND	Nice to run into you again.
L618154	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
L618153	u8500	m577	BOND	I'll keep that in mind.
L618152	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
L618151	u8500	m577	BOND	Insurance. Lloyds of London.
L618150	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
L618149	u8500	m577	BOND	Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
L618148	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
L618147	u8500	m577	BOND	Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
L618146	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
L618145	u8500	m577	BOND	Boyfriend?
L618144	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
L618143	u8500	m577	BOND	Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
L618142	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Sidney Winch.
L618141	u8500	m577	BOND	This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
L618140	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Have we met?
L618139	u8500	m577	BOND	- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
L618138	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
L618137	u8500	m577	BOND	I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
L618136	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Bourbon. Neat.
L618035	u8500	m577	BOND	A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
L618034	u8509	m577	M	Sabotage?
L618033	u8500	m577	BOND	The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
L618032	u8500	m577	BOND	It doesn't quite add up.
L618031	u8509	m577	M	What do you make of all this?
L618030	u8500	m577	BOND	I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
L618029	u8509	m577	M	...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
L618001	u8509	m577	M	Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
L618000	u8500	m577	BOND	Sorry I'm late -
L617778	u8509	m577	M	Good luck on your mission, 007.
L617777	u8500	m577	BOND	...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
L617746	u8500	m577	BOND	Hopefully, it won't get that far.
L617745	u8509	m577	M	But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
L617744	u8509	m577	M	We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
L617743	u8500	m577	BOND	.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
L617737	u8500	m577	BOND	I understand.
L617736	u8509	m577	M	You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
L617732	u8509	m577	M	Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
L617731	u8500	m577	BOND	... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
L617730	u8509	m577	M	Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
L617729	u8500	m577	BOND	Of course.
L617728	u8509	m577	M	The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
L617719	u8509	m577	M	It seems, 007, we've received a tip
L617718	u8500	m577	BOND	... What's Harmsway done?
L617716	u8500	m577	BOND	'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
L617715	u8509	m577	M	- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
L617712	u8500	m577	BOND	Only what I read in the newspapers.
L617711	u8509	m577	M	Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
L617709	u8500	m577	BOND	Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
L617708	u8509	m577	M	Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
L617680	u8500	m577	BOND	Yes, M.
L617679	u8509	m577	M	Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
L617670	u8500	m577	BOND	Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
L617669	u8508	m577	JENNY WU	Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
L617653	u8508	m577	JENNY WU	Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
L617652	u8500	m577	BOND	Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
L617651	u8508	m577	JENNY WU	Sakwa!
L617650	u8500	m577	BOND	Remind me.
L617649	u8508	m577	JENNY WU	We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
L617648	u8500	m577	BOND	I was just getting to the interesting part!
L617647	u8508	m577	JENNY WU	Stop it!
L617646	u8500	m577	BOND	And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
L617645	u8500	m577	BOND	Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
L617644	u8508	m577	JENNY WU	Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
L617643	u8500	m577	BOND	... And what do you call these?
L618258	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
L618257	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	You won't get away with this!
L618255	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	You leave me no alternative.
L618254	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	No.
L618253	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
L618252	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	I was an attorney!
L618251	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
L618250	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
L618249	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
L618248	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	My name is Sidney Winch, and -
L618247	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Captain Morton.
L618246	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	What's your name?
L618239	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Who's Wade?
L618238	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Forget it. No way. I got here first.
L618237	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
L618236	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	I am. What do you want?
L618235	u8502	m577	CAPTAIN MORTON	Who's in charge here?
L618069	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Excellent.
L618068	u8504	m577	EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
L618067	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Yes -
L618066	u8504	m577	EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	The Queen invited you to dinner -
L618065	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	No -
L618064	u8504	m577	EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
L618063	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
L618062	u8504	m577	EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
L618061	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Pencil it in for the next trip -
L618060	u8504	m577	EXECUTIVE SECRETARY	The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
L617948	u8505	m577	FIRST OFFICER	Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
L617947	u8507	m577	HELMSMAN	Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
L617946	u8505	m577	FIRST OFFICER	A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
L617944	u8507	m577	HELMSMAN	Seems to be back to normal, sir.
L617943	u8505	m577	FIRST OFFICER	How is it now?
L617941	u8505	m577	FIRST OFFICER	Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
L617940	u8507	m577	HELMSMAN	The back-up does the same thing.
L617935	u8507	m577	HELMSMAN	About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
L617934	u8505	m577	FIRST OFFICER	What's wrong?
L617933	u8507	m577	HELMSMAN	Damn. It's doing it again.
L618518	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	My timing always was lousy.
L618517	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	How sweet.
L618345	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
L618344	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
L618343	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
L618337	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	...I see.
L618336	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	He brought that up from the wreck.
L618332	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
L618331	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	- I told you! He was there! -
L618330	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
L618325	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	I see you two have met.
L618324	u8516	m577	SIDNEY	What is HE doing here?
L618524	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	You come with me -  You stay here.
L618523	u8520	m577	YUNG	Take the men. I can finish alone.
L618502	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
L618501	u8520	m577	YUNG	You have to leave -
L618500	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
L618498	u8520	m577	YUNG	Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
L618497	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
L618490	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Start the grinders.
L618489	u8520	m577	YUNG	Approaching the first gate.
L618488	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
L618484	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Excellent.
L618483	u8520	m577	YUNG	The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
L617878	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
L617877	u8520	m577	YUNG	That was too close.
L618548	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Kill him! Finish it!
L618547	u8517	m577	STAMPER	It's Bond!
L618546	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	What the hell is going on?
L618466	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
L618465	u8517	m577	STAMPER	Yes. Shall we kill them?
L618464	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
L618425	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
L618424	u8517	m577	STAMPER	They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
L618403	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Get more men up there!
L618402	u8517	m577	STAMPER	It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
L618028	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
L618027	u8517	m577	STAMPER	Fueled and waiting.
L618026	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Is the helicopter ready?
L617919	u8512	m577	NUMBER THREE	Thank you sir! Thank you!
L617918	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
L617917	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
L617916	u8512	m577	NUMBER THREE	Please sir. Please -
L617915	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	You disappoint me, Number Three.
L617914	u8512	m577	NUMBER THREE	No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
L617913	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
L617912	u8512	m577	NUMBER THREE	Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
L617911	u8506	m577	HARMSWAY	...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
L617910	u8512	m577	NUMBER THREE	I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
L617635	u8518	m577	TANNER	Yes.
L617634	u8509	m577	M	Will the cruise set it off?
L617633	u8518	m577	TANNER	Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
L617628	u8509	m577	M	Abort the cruise.
L617627	u8518	m577	TANNER	Maybe. Maybe not.
L617626	u8509	m577	M	Will it go off?
L617624	u8509	m577	M	What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
L617623	u8518	m577	TANNER	I don't know. He's not in the database -
L617622	u8509	m577	M	Who is that?!? What's in the box??
L617620	u8509	m577	M	Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
L617619	u8518	m577	TANNER	Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
L617618	u8509	m577	M	Who is it?
L617617	u8518	m577	TANNER	Oh, no.
L617601	u8518	m577	TANNER	One to seven: Deal the face cards.
L617600	u8509	m577	M	What about ID's?
L621983	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Let's let Molly open one.
L621982	u8534	m579	ANDY	Which one can I open first?
L621980	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
L621979	u8534	m579	ANDY	Here!  In the car!
L621978	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
L621977	u8534	m579	ANDY	Woody!  Buzz!
L621976	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	What?  What is it?
L621975	u8534	m579	ANDY	Hey!  Wow!
L621905	u8534	m579	ANDY	Bye, house.
L621904	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	"Everybody say, ""Bye, house."""
L621812	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
L621811	u8534	m579	ANDY	But what if we leave them behind?
L621810	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
L621641	u8534	m579	ANDY	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
L621640	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
L621639	u8534	m579	ANDY	Right here in the van.
L621638	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Where was the last place you left him?
L621637	u8534	m579	ANDY	Mom, have you seen Woody?
L621491	u8534	m579	ANDY	Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
L621490	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Next stop...
L621479	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
L621478	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
L621477	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yeah?!
L621476	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
L621475	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can I help pump the gas?
L621471	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
L621470	u8534	m579	ANDY	I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
L621469	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay...
L621468	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
L621467	u8534	m579	ANDY	But Mom, I can't find him!
L621466	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
L621464	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	No, I haven't seen him.
L621463	u8534	m579	ANDY	Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
L621422	u8534	m579	ANDY	Just one?
L621421	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	You can bring ONE toy...
L621420	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can I bring some toys?
L621418	u8534	m579	ANDY	Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
L621417	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
L621416	u8534	m579	ANDY	To infinity and beyond!
L621271	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, yeah!
L621270	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
L621137	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay.
L621136	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
L621135	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yeah!
L621134	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, sure, we can leave it up.
L621133	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can we leave this up 'til we move?
L621132	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
L621131	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Whadda ya think?
L621130	u8534	m579	ANDY	Wow!  Cool!
L621990	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Mm-hmmmmm.
L621989	u8545	m579	WOODY	Say, isn't that mistletoe?
L621988	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
L621987	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
L621943	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Rocky!  The ramp!
L621942	u8545	m579	WOODY	We're almost there.
L621752	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
L621751	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	What are you doing over there?
L621363	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
L621362	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
L621315	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
L621314	u8545	m579	WOODY	You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
L621175	u8545	m579	WOODY	Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
L621174	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
L621173	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, hey - it was nothing.
L621172	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
L621171	u8545	m579	WOODY	Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
L622000	u8545	m579	WOODY	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
L621999	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
L621974	u8536	m579	BUZZ	We're not aiming for the truck!
L621973	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
L621972	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
L621971	u8536	m579	BUZZ	This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
L621970	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
L621968	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Not today!
L621967	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
L621962	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
L621961	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha-ha!!
L621960	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hold still, Buzz!
L621959	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody?!  What are you doing?
L621956	u8545	m579	WOODY	The match!
L621955	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  The rocket!
L621954	u8545	m579	WOODY	Great!
L621935	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look out!!
L621934	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, thanks for the ride.
L621916	u8536	m579	BUZZ	NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
L621915	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
L621914	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hold on, Woody!
L621902	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!
L621901	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
L621878	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's ok.  Everything's under control.
L621877	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What?!
L621876	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shhhhhhh!
L621842	u8545	m579	WOODY	We've got to get out of here...NOW.
L621841	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  It's the moving van.
L621839	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes Sir!
L621838	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
L621837	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
L621832	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
L621831	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But why would Andy want me?
L621830	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
L621829	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yeah, right.
L621828	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
L621827	u8536	m579	BUZZ	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
L621826	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
L621825	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
L621824	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
L621823	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
L621822	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
L621729	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Years of Academy training...wasted!!
L621728	u8545	m579	WOODY	Come on, this way!
L621727	u8545	m579	WOODY	Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
L621726	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
L621725	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
L621724	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
L621723	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Oh, I'm a sham!!
L621719	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
L621718	u8545	m579	WOODY	I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
L621717	u8536	m579	BUZZ	One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
L621716	u8545	m579	WOODY	What happened to you?
L621672	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shhh!
L621671	u8545	m579	WOODY	Don't tell me what to do!
L621670	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
L621667	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
L621666	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, stop it!!
L621665	u8545	m579	WOODY	Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
L621664	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
L621663	u8545	m579	WOODY	Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
L621662	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
L621661	u8536	m579	BUZZ	It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
L621660	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shield your eyes!
L621659	u8545	m579	WOODY	They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
L621658	u8545	m579	WOODY	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
L621657	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, we don't know what's out there!
L621655	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
L621654	u8545	m579	WOODY	I sure hope this isn't permanent.
L621633	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
L621632	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I've set my laser from stun to kill.
L621574	u8545	m579	WOODY	YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
L621573	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
L621555	u8545	m579	WOODY	Alright Buzz, get ready...
L621554	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Spaceship.
L621553	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where is it?  I don't see the --
L621552	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
L621551	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
L621550	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean it has hyperdrive?
L621549	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
L621542	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sorry.
L621541	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ow!  Watch where you're going!
L621524	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
L621523	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
L621522	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Well, then let's climb abroad.
L621521	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
L621520	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
L621516	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Go away.
L621515	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
L621503	u8545	m579	WOODY	WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
L621502	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
L621501	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
L621500	u8536	m579	BUZZ	My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
L621499	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
L621498	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
L621497	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
L621496	u8536	m579	BUZZ	According to my nava-computer, the --
L621487	u8545	m579	WOODY	No.
L621486	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But we're not on my planet, are we?
L621485	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh.  Oh, that's good.
L621484	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
L621483	u8545	m579	WOODY	Right?  Buddy?
L621429	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Then we've no time to lose!!
L621428	u8545	m579	WOODY	Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
L621427	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Trouble?!  Where?!
L621426	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
L621414	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
L621413	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I could have stopped him.
L621401	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean that happy child?
L621400	u8545	m579	WOODY	THAT is Sid!
L621399	u8545	m579	WOODY	No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
L621398	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sure is a hairy fellah.
L621397	u8545	m579	WOODY	That's why.  Sid.
L621396	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
L621395	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I'd better take a look anyway.
L621394	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
L621393	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's going on?
L621379	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where?
L621378	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
L621377	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You're mocking me, aren't you?
L621376	u8545	m579	WOODY	"You actually think you're THE ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!"
L621373	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
L621372	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't even think about it, cowboy!
L621371	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
L621370	u8545	m579	WOODY	And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
L621369	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
L621368	u8545	m579	WOODY	Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
L621346	u8545	m579	WOODY	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
L621345	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
L621340	u8536	m579	BUZZ	All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
L621339	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
L621338	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
L621337	u8545	m579	WOODY	Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
L621336	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Can!
L621335	u8545	m579	WOODY	You can't!
L621334	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yes, I can.
L621333	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, you can't.
L621332	u8536	m579	BUZZ	They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
L621329	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me.
L621328	u8545	m579	WOODY	He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
L621325	u8545	m579	WOODY	The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
L621324	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
L621323	u8545	m579	WOODY	T-O-Y.  Toy.
L621322	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Toy?
L621301	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
L621300	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
L621296	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Watch yourself!!
L621295	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
L621294	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
L621293	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
L621290	u8536	m579	BUZZ	HO-YAAAHH!!!
L621289	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hello-o-o...
L621773	u8545	m579	WOODY	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
L621772	u8537	m579	HAMM	Something's screwy here.
L621742	u8537	m579	HAMM	Everyone, it's Woody!
L621741	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hi!
L621331	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
L621330	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
L621319	u8537	m579	HAMM	What's with him?
L621318	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
L621259	u8545	m579	WOODY	Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
L621258	u8537	m579	HAMM	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
L621257	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
L621199	u8545	m579	WOODY	Stay calm, everyone!!
L621198	u8537	m579	HAMM	Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
L621197	u8545	m579	WOODY	It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
L621779	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Murderer!
L621778	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, that is disgusting.
L621740	u8537	m579	HAMM	He's in the psycho's bedroom!
L621739	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Son of a building block, it's Woody!
L621737	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	How 'bout three out of five?
L621736	u8537	m579	HAMM	No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
L621735	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
L621734	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Are you peeking?
L621733	u8537	m579	HAMM	Heh-heh.
L621732	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Ohhh!  You sunk it!
L621731	u8537	m579	HAMM	Miss.  G-6.
L621730	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	B-3.
L621456	u8537	m579	HAMM	I got dibs on his hat!
L621455	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Let's string him up by his pull- string!
L621243	u8537	m579	HAMM	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
L621242	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Hey, watch it!
L621202	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	I can't see a thing!

L621598	u8538	m579	HANNAH	What?
L621817	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
L621816	u8541	m579	REX	I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
L621815	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Will you quit moving around?!
L621814	u8541	m579	REX	Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
L621645	u8541	m579	REX	Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
L621644	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
L621403	u8541	m579	REX	He tortures toys -- just for fun.
L621402	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	That ain't no happy child.
L621327	u8541	m579	REX	Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
L621326	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
L621313	u8541	m579	REX	And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
L621312	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
L621279	u8541	m579	REX	Have you been replaced?

L621785	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Come on.  Let's get out of here.
L621784	u8545	m579	WOODY	No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
L621783	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
L621782	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, it's not what you think, I swear!
L621781	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	You murdering dog!

L621777	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nothing.
L621776	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
L621762	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
L621761	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	You are a liar!
L621760	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
L621759	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
L621756	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
L621755	u8545	m579	WOODY	Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
L621448	u8545	m579	WOODY	Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
L621447	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
L621446	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
L621388	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
L621387	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Who is it this time?
L621365	u8545	m579	WOODY	Alright!  That's it!
L621364	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
L621321	u8545	m579	WOODY	All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
L621320	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Laser-envy.
L621233	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	A lunchbox...?!
L621232	u8545	m579	WOODY	A lunchbox?!
L621192	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
L621191	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
L621771	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
L621770	u8541	m579	REX	Hey look!  It's Buzz!
L621769	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
L621766	u8541	m579	REX	Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
L621765	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
L621223	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
L621222	u8541	m579	REX	Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
L621213	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay, save your batteries!
L621212	u8541	m579	REX	Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
L621211	u8545	m579	WOODY	If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
L621196	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
L621195	u8541	m579	REX	But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
L621194	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
L621169	u8545	m579	WOODY	I was close to being scared that time.
L621168	u8541	m579	REX	Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
L621167	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
L621166	u8541	m579	REX	ROOAAAARR!!!
L621754	u8541	m579	REX	He got it, Woody!
L621753	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I got it, Woody!
L621473	u8541	m579	REX	There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
L621472	u8544	m579	SLINKY	It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
L621450	u8541	m579	REX	Oh, I don't like confrontations.
L621449	u8544	m579	SLINKY	We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
L621383	u8541	m579	REX	I thought he was at summer camp!
L621382	u8544	m579	SLINKY	It's Sid!
L621275	u8541	m579	REX	Woody?  Who's up there with you?
L621274	u8544	m579	SLINKY	What the heck is up there?
L621207	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
L621206	u8541	m579	REX	They're getting bigger.
L621998	u8542	m579	SARGENT	I can't quite make out -- 
L621997	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
L621264	u8545	m579	WOODY	Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
L621263	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
L621262	u8545	m579	WOODY	There.
L621245	u8545	m579	WOODY	So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
L621244	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
L621240	u8542	m579	SARGENT	It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
L621239	u8545	m579	WOODY	Last present!
L621238	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Okay, we're on the last present now...
L621229	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
L621228	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
L621227	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
L621216	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Yes SIR!
L621215	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
L621149	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay, thank you.  At ease.
L621148	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Sir!  No Sir!
L621147	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
L621893	u8545	m579	WOODY	That's right.  Your toys.
L621892	u8543	m579	SID	W-w-w-we?
L621889	u8543	m579	SID	It's busted.
L621888	u8545	m579	WOODY	Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
L621887	u8543	m579	SID	What?!
L621886	u8545	m579	WOODY	This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
L621885	u8543	m579	SID	Huh?
L621884	u8545	m579	WOODY	Reach for the sky!!
L621799	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sid!!!
L621798	u8543	m579	SID	Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
L621569	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is ludicrous.
L621392	u8543	m579	SID	Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
L621391	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
L621381	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-oh.
L621380	u8543	m579	SID	Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
L621953	u8545	m579	WOODY	Slink!  Hang on!
L621952	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I can't hold on much longer!
L621949	u8545	m579	WOODY	Speed up!
L621948	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody!  Speed up!
L621775	u8544	m579	SLINKY	See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
L621774	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
L621750	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I knew you'd come back, Woody!
L621749	u8545	m579	WOODY	Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
L621746	u8545	m579	WOODY	We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
L621745	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody?!
L621349	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
L621348	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
L621277	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
L621276	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
L621159	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Got it.
L621158	u8545	m579	WOODY	Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
L621157	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!
L621156	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Bad news?!
L621155	u8545	m579	WOODY	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
L621154	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
L621153	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, Slink --
L621152	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I'm red this time.
L621151	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Right here, Woody!
L621150	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, Slinky?
L624538	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It runs deep. Share it with me.
L624537	u8593	m583	BEING	My pain?
L624536	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I couldn't help but notice you pain.
L624528	u8593	m583	BEING	Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
L624527	u8604	m583	SYBOK	The ship....
L624526	u8593	m583	BEING	Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
L624525	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No, no, it's not possible.
L624517	u8593	m583	BEING	He doubts me.
L624516	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
L624512	u8593	m583	BEING	You doubt me?
L624511	u8604	m583	SYBOK	He has his doubts...
L624500	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It will be your chariot!
L624499	u8593	m583	BEING	Then I shall make use of this starship.
L624498	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It could. Yes.
L624497	u8593	m583	BEING	This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
L624496	u8604	m583	SYBOK	With a starship!
L624495	u8593	m583	BEING	And how did you breach the Barrier?
L624494	u8604	m583	SYBOK	We sought only your infinite wisdom.
L624493	u8593	m583	BEING	Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
L624492	u8604	m583	SYBOK	It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
L624491	u8593	m583	BEING	It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
L624490	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Qual se tu?
L623994	u8605	m583	UHURA	Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
L623993	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
L623992	u8605	m583	UHURA	My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
L623989	u8605	m583	UHURA	Is there a problem, gentlemen?
L623988	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
L623987	u8605	m583	UHURA	Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
L623986	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Rescued at last.
L623985	u8605	m583	UHURA	Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
L624541	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
L624540	u8603	m583	SULU	In firing position. Torpedo armed.
L624325	u8603	m583	SULU	Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
L624324	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Following new course. Warp seven.
L624309	u8603	m583	SULU	Pavel.
L624308	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
L624307	u8603	m583	SULU	Plotting our new course.
L624306	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Sulu, what are you doing?
L623991	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
L623990	u8603	m583	SULU	Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
L623982	u8603	m583	SULU	All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
L623981	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Admit it. We're lost.
L624246	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	I don't have a clue.
L624245	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
L624226	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	DO it. Go to Red Alert.
L624225	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	But the shuttle-
L624224	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Raise shields.
L624223	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
L624219	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Closing.
L624218	u8594	m583	CHEKOV	Position, Bird of Prey?
L624217	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Shuttle en route.
L624193	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
L624192	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
L624191	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What's going on?
L624171	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
L624170	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
L624169	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
L624166	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
L624165	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
L624164	u8604	m583	SYBOK	A Federation starship.
L624163	u8595	m583	CHEKOV'S IMAGE	This is the Starship Enterprise.
L624097	u8598	m583	KIRK	Understood. Kirk out.
L624096	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	No, but you can bet they will.
L624095	u8598	m583	KIRK	Have the Klingons responded?
L624094	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
L624093	u8598	m583	KIRK	Oh, please.
L624092	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
L624091	u8598	m583	KIRK	With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
L624090	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
L624089	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
L624088	u8598	m583	KIRK	"On ""The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"""
L624087	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
L624086	u8598	m583	KIRK	You caught me on my way to the shower.
L624085	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
L624084	u8598	m583	KIRK	Bob?
L624083	u8596	m583	COMMANDERS IMAGE	Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
L624082	u8598	m583	KIRK	Can we have it quiet?
L623924	u8600	m583	RIDER	Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
L623923	u8597	m583	J'ONN	But how?
L623922	u8600	m583	RIDER	Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
L623921	u8597	m583	J'ONN	A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
L623920	u8600	m583	RIDER	What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
L623919	u8597	m583	J'ONN	What is it you seek?
L623918	u8600	m583	RIDER	Join my quest.
L623917	u8597	m583	J'ONN	I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
L623916	u8600	m583	RIDER	The power was within you.
L623915	u8597	m583	J'ONN	Where did you get this power?
L623913	u8600	m583	RIDER	Let us explore it together.
L623912	u8597	m583	J'ONN	What do you know of my pain?
L623911	u8600	m583	RIDER	Your pain runs deep.
L623910	u8597	m583	J'ONN	It's all I have.
L623909	u8600	m583	RIDER	Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
L624553	u8598	m583	KIRK	Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
L624552	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
L624359	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
L624358	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
L624357	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
L624353	u8598	m583	KIRK	If we could send a distress signal...
L624352	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
L624154	u8598	m583	KIRK	Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
L624153	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
L624104	u8598	m583	KIRK	I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
L624103	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
L624068	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
L624067	u8598	m583	KIRK	Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
L624066	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
L624065	u8598	m583	KIRK	You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
L624258	u8598	m583	KIRK	Go, Sulu.
L624257	u8605	m583	UHURA	Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
L624152	u8598	m583	KIRK	Transporter room. Status.
L624151	u8605	m583	UHURA	Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
L624150	u8598	m583	KIRK	Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
L624149	u8605	m583	UHURA	Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
L624148	u8598	m583	KIRK	Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
L624119	u8598	m583	KIRK	Put it on the screen.
L624118	u8605	m583	UHURA	Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
L624076	u8598	m583	KIRK	Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
L624075	u8605	m583	UHURA	Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
L624056	u8605	m583	UHURA	ER... You forgot to take it with you.
L624055	u8598	m583	KIRK	Why didn't you beep my communicator?
L624054	u8605	m583	UHURA	Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
L624592	u8598	m583	KIRK	Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
L624591	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
L624590	u8598	m583	KIRK	Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
L624579	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Not possible. You were never alone.
L624578	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, I thought I was going to die.
L624577	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Welcome aboard, Captain.
L624576	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock?
L624432	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I believe we are witnessing my birth.
L624431	u8598	m583	KIRK	What is this?
L624430	u8602	m583	SPOCK	It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
L624429	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock... don't.
L624383	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
L624382	u8602	m583	SPOCK	...mark two.
L624379	u8598	m583	KIRK	To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
L624378	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The emergency channel, open.
L624377	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock.
L624373	u8598	m583	KIRK	Fire the rockets!
L624372	u8602	m583	SPOCK	If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
L624371	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock... the booster rockets.
L624370	u8598	m583	KIRK	It must be all those marsh melons.
L624369	u8602	m583	SPOCK	It would appear we are too heavy.
L624366	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Uh-uh.
L624365	u8598	m583	KIRK	Hmmm?
L624364	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I believe I have found a faster way.
L624355	u8598	m583	KIRK	The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
L624354	u8602	m583	SPOCK	There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
L624348	u8602	m583	SPOCK	"c.... ""k."""
L624347	u8598	m583	KIRK	"New word. ""b"".. ""a""... um..."
L624346	u8598	m583	KIRK	"a... ""n""...uh, ""d""... end of word."
L624345	u8602	m583	SPOCK	"A ""t."""
L624344	u8598	m583	KIRK	"You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an ""s."""
L624341	u8598	m583	KIRK	That's a little vague, Spock -
L624340	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I am here, Captain.
L624339	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
L624338	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
L624337	u8598	m583	KIRK	But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
L624336	u8602	m583	SPOCK	There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
L624332	u8602	m583	SPOCK	That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
L624331	u8598	m583	KIRK	Is what possible?
L624330	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Is it possible?
L624323	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He did have pointed ears.
L624322	u8598	m583	KIRK	This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
L624321	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
L624320	u8598	m583	KIRK	How do you know?
L624319	u8602	m583	SPOCK	This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
L624318	u8598	m583	KIRK	There's got to be a way out of this place.
L624302	u8598	m583	KIRK	He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
L624301	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
L624300	u8598	m583	KIRK	Why didn't you tell me this before?
L624299	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
L624298	u8598	m583	KIRK	I gotta sit down.
L624297	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I have a half brother.
L624296	u8598	m583	KIRK	There, you see? See?
L624295	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
L624294	u8598	m583	KIRK	You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
L624293	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I did not.
L624292	u8598	m583	KIRK	You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
L624291	u8602	m583	SPOCK	No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
L624290	u8598	m583	KIRK	Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
L624289	u8602	m583	SPOCK	You ordered me to kill my brother.
L624288	u8598	m583	KIRK	I ordered you to defend this ship.
L624287	u8602	m583	SPOCK	If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
L624286	u8598	m583	KIRK	You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
L624285	u8602	m583	SPOCK	If you think it would help.
L624284	u8598	m583	KIRK	Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
L624283	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
L624282	u8598	m583	KIRK	What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
L624281	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Captain, what have I done -
L624280	u8598	m583	KIRK	Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
L624239	u8598	m583	KIRK	Let me do something.
L624238	u8602	m583	SPOCK	You must allow us to act.
L624235	u8598	m583	KIRK	An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
L624234	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Exactly 15.5 seconds.
L624181	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes, Captain.
L624180	u8598	m583	KIRK	Be one with the horse.
L624179	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes, Captain?
L624178	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock.
L624173	u8598	m583	KIRK	We don't have 1.2 hours.
L624172	u8602	m583	SPOCK	At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
L624160	u8598	m583	KIRK	Mr. Sulu. Execute.
L624159	u8602	m583	SPOCK	To land any closer would risk detection.
L624158	u8598	m583	KIRK	That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
L624157	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
L624156	u8598	m583	KIRK	Damn.  Let's go.
L624155	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
L624141	u8598	m583	KIRK	Fascinating.
L624140	u8602	m583	SPOCK	When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
L624139	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
L624138	u8598	m583	KIRK	Why?
L624137	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
L624136	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
L624135	u8598	m583	KIRK	What do you mean?
L624134	u8602	m583	SPOCK	There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
L624133	u8598	m583	KIRK	Who is it he reminds you of?
L624132	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I do not often think of the past.
L624131	u8602	m583	SPOCK	He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
L624130	u8598	m583	KIRK	But he does seem familiar?
L624129	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I cannot be certain.
L624128	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
L624127	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
L624126	u8598	m583	KIRK	What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
L624123	u8598	m583	KIRK	General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
L624122	u8602	m583	SPOCK	The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
L624121	u8598	m583	KIRK	Not General Korrd.
L624072	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes.
L624071	u8598	m583	KIRK	I could use a shower.
L624040	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Goodnight, Doctor.
L624039	u8598	m583	KIRK	Goodnight, Spock.
L624038	u8598	m583	KIRK	Goodnight, Bones.
L624037	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Yes, Captain.
L624036	u8598	m583	KIRK	Go to sleep, Spock.
L624035	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Life is not a dream.
L624034	u8598	m583	KIRK	Yes, Spock?
L624033	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Jim.
L624032	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
L624031	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Captain?
L624027	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
L624026	u8598	m583	KIRK	Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
L624025	u8598	m583	KIRK	"The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, ""Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.."" The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please."
L624024	u8602	m583	SPOCK	That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
L624023	u8598	m583	KIRK	"Row, row, row your boat... I love ""Row...""  Do - do you know ""Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"""
L624021	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Are we leaving, Captain?
L624020	u8598	m583	KIRK	Pack Up Your Troubles.
L624019	u8598	m583	KIRK	That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
L624018	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
L624015	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
L624014	u8598	m583	KIRK	What are you doing?
L624012	u8598	m583	KIRK	I've always known... I'll die alone.
L624011	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I don't understand.
L624010	u8598	m583	KIRK	Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
L623941	u8602	m583	SPOCK	"Perhaps ""because it is there"" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain."
L623940	u8598	m583	KIRK	Oh, God
L623939	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
L623938	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
L623937	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
L623936	u8598	m583	KIRK	On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
L623935	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
L623934	u8598	m583	KIRK	MM.?
L623933	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Ah, Captain?
L623932	u8598	m583	KIRK	Because it's there.
L623931	u8602	m583	SPOCK	And that is?
L623930	u8598	m583	KIRK	I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
L623929	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
L623928	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
L623927	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
L624531	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Spock...
L624530	u8598	m583	KIRK	Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
L624529	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What have I done?
L624475	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Because you, too, must know.
L624474	u8598	m583	KIRK	What makes you think I won't turn us around?
L624473	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No conditions.
L624472	u8598	m583	KIRK	No special conditions?
L624471	u8604	m583	SYBOK	The ship needs its Captain.
L624470	u8598	m583	KIRK	About the ship...
L624456	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Am I? We'll see.
L624455	u8598	m583	KIRK	You are mad!
L624454	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
L624453	u8598	m583	KIRK	Your vision?
L624452	u8604	m583	SYBOK	But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
L624451	u8598	m583	KIRK	Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
L624438	u8598	m583	KIRK	No. I refuse.
L624437	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Now learn something about yourself.
L624436	u8598	m583	KIRK	No... I didn't.
L624435	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
L624434	u8598	m583	KIRK	Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
L624405	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I don't control minds. I free them.
L624404	u8598	m583	KIRK	The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
L624403	u8604	m583	SYBOK	"Sha Ka Ree. ""The Scource."" ""Heaven."" ""Eden."" call it ""Qui'Tu."" To the Romulans, it's ""Vorta Vor."" The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality."
L624392	u8598	m583	KIRK	I'm afraid of nothing.
L624391	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
L624390	u8598	m583	KIRK	You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
L624389	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I trust your message was received?
L624267	u8598	m583	KIRK	I'll take you to the bridge.
L624266	u8604	m583	SYBOK	We must change our course at once.
L624250	u8598	m583	KIRK	In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
L624249	u8604	m583	SYBOK	What are you doing?
L624233	u8598	m583	KIRK	Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
L624232	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No! No reply. Remain on course.
L624214	u8604	m583	SYBOK	But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
L624213	u8598	m583	KIRK	James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
L624212	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Who are you?
L624211	u8598	m583	KIRK	You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
L624210	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I must have your starship.
L624053	u8599	m583	KLAA	  
L624402	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
L624401	u8605	m583	UHURA	No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
L624399	u8605	m583	UHURA	No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
L624398	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	He's not?
L624397	u8605	m583	UHURA	Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
L624396	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
L624395	u8605	m583	UHURA	Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
L623979	u8605	m583	UHURA	Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
L623978	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
L623969	u8605	m583	UHURA	I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
L623968	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
L623967	u8605	m583	UHURA	And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
L623966	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
L623965	u8605	m583	UHURA	I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
L623964	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Let's see what she's got, said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
L623963	u8601	m583	SCOTTY	Borgus Frat.
L624535	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
L624534	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok, we must find a way...
L624533	u8604	m583	SYBOK	This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
L624532	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok.
L624523	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
L624522	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
L624449	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
L624448	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I don't understand...
L624447	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I belong here.
L624446	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Why not?
L624445	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I cannot go with you.
L624444	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Spock?
L624428	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Do you?
L624427	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I know you better than that.
L624426	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I hide no pain.
L624425	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Each man's pain is unique.
L624275	u8604	m583	SYBOK	You know I'm right.
L624274	u8602	m583	SPOCK	No. I will not.
L624273	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
L624270	u8604	m583	SYBOK	No. You must kill me.
L624269	u8602	m583	SPOCK	Sybok, you must surrender.
L624216	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
L624215	u8602	m583	SPOCK	I am a Starfleet Officer.
L624209	u8604	m583	SYBOK	I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
L624208	u8602	m583	SPOCK	It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
L624207	u8604	m583	SYBOK	Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
L625846	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
L625845	u8607	m584	ALAN	Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
L625837	u8607	m584	ALAN	Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
L625836	u8611	m584	FLYNN	And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
L625835	u8607	m584	ALAN	Your old files -- ?
L625833	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I know, I met him.
L625832	u8607	m584	ALAN	Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
L625456	u8607	m584	ALAN	Uh... got any cinnamon?
L625455	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Want one?
L625454	u8607	m584	ALAN	I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
L625453	u8611	m584	FLYNN	My dinner.
L625452	u8607	m584	ALAN	Hi, Flynn.
L625451	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hi, Alan.
L625435	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
L625434	u8607	m584	ALAN	Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
L625431	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
L625430	u8607	m584	ALAN	Dillinger?
L625426	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
L625425	u8607	m584	ALAN	I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
L625424	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
L625423	u8607	m584	ALAN	Senior exec.
L625422	u8611	m584	FLYNN	"Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has ""invented"" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?"
L625421	u8607	m584	ALAN	You invented Space Paranoids?
L625420	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
L625419	u8611	m584	FLYNN	You haven't told him?
L625418	u8607	m584	ALAN	I don't get it.
L625417	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Embezzling is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
L625416	u8607	m584	ALAN	Are you embezzling?
L625415	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
L625414	u8607	m584	ALAN	You did break in.
L625459	u8607	m584	ALAN	I'm certainly not.
L625458	u8613	m584	LORA	I don't think I'm cleared for this.
L625411	u8607	m584	ALAN	Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
L625410	u8613	m584	LORA	Flynn!
L625400	u8607	m584	ALAN	What -- ?
L625399	u8613	m584	LORA	For being on to Dillinger.
L625398	u8607	m584	ALAN	For what?
L625397	u8613	m584	LORA	That Dillinger's on to him.
L625396	u8607	m584	ALAN	Of what?
L625395	u8613	m584	LORA	To warn him.
L625394	u8607	m584	ALAN	What for?
L625393	u8613	m584	LORA	I mean I want both of us to go.
L625392	u8607	m584	ALAN	You call that getting over it?
L625391	u8613	m584	LORA	I want to go to his place.
L625390	u8607	m584	ALAN	Okay, okay...
L625389	u8613	m584	LORA	Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
L625388	u8607	m584	ALAN	Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
L625387	u8613	m584	LORA	Flynn had Group 7 access.
L625386	u8607	m584	ALAN	Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
L625385	u8613	m584	LORA	Did he say why?
L625384	u8607	m584	ALAN	Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
L625383	u8613	m584	LORA	Did you say Group 7 access?
L625378	u8607	m584	ALAN	Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
L625377	u8613	m584	LORA	How's it going upstairs?
L625382	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
L625381	u8607	m584	ALAN	They'll start to soon enough.
L625380	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
L625379	u8607	m584	ALAN	Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
L625376	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
L625375	u8607	m584	ALAN	Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
L625374	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
L625373	u8607	m584	ALAN	Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
L625372	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Hello, Alan.
L625371	u8607	m584	ALAN	Beautiful!
L625347	u8607	m584	ALAN	Ok
L625346	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
L625345	u8607	m584	ALAN	No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
L625344	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
L625343	u8607	m584	ALAN	It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
L625342	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
L625341	u8607	m584	ALAN	I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
L625340	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
L625339	u8607	m584	ALAN	Yeah...?
L625338	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
L625337	u8607	m584	ALAN	Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
L625336	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
L625335	u8607	m584	ALAN	Alan. Alan Bailey.
L625334	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Come on in...
L625780	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Let's get outta here.
L625779	u8608	m584	BIT	Yes!
L625719	u8611	m584	FLYNN	So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
L625718	u8608	m584	BIT	You said it.
L625643	u8608	m584	BIT	Not a chance.
L625642	u8611	m584	FLYNN	This town's full o' live ones.
L625637	u8608	m584	BIT	No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
L625636	u8611	m584	FLYNN	This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
L625615	u8608	m584	BIT	Yes, okay, exactement!
L625614	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Way to go! We're haulin'!
L625612	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
L625611	u8608	m584	BIT	Right on the money!
L625610	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I'm your program?
L625609	u8608	m584	BIT	No...
L625608	u8611	m584	FLYNN	where's your program? Won't it miss you?
L625607	u8608	m584	BIT	For sure...
L625606	u8611	m584	FLYNN	only yes and no...  You're a bit.
L625605	u8608	m584	BIT	Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
L625604	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Oh. Anything else?
L625603	u8608	m584	BIT	No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
L625602	u8611	m584	FLYNN	That all you can say?
L625601	u8608	m584	BIT	Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
L625600	u8611	m584	FLYNN	"What do you mean, ""'yes""?"
L625363	u8614	m584	MCP	So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
L625362	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	You wouldn't dare.
L625361	u8614	m584	MCP	You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
L625360	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	If you think -
L625359	u8614	m584	MCP	The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
L625358	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	What do you want with the Pentagon?
L625357	u8614	m584	MCP	I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
L625356	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
L625355	u8614	m584	MCP	It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
L625354	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	The Pentagon?
L625353	u8614	m584	MCP	And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
L625352	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
L625351	u8614	m584	MCP	I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
L625350	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	I'm sorry -
L625349	u8614	m584	MCP	Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
L625330	u8614	m584	MCP	End of line.
L625329	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Cute.
L625328	u8614	m584	MCP	There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
L625327	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
L625326	u8614	m584	MCP	I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
L625325	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Meanwhile, he might find it.
L625324	u8614	m584	MCP	I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
L625323	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
L625322	u8614	m584	MCP	Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
L625321	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Flynn?
L625320	u8614	m584	MCP	It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
L625319	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
L625448	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
L625447	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
L625446	u8612	m584	GIBBS	That was uncalled-for.
L625445	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	It can be arranged...
L625444	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
L625442	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
L625441	u8612	m584	GIBBS	User requests are what computers are for.
L625440	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
L625439	u8612	m584	GIBBS	That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
L625438	u8609	m584	DILLINGER	Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
L625437	u8612	m584	GIBBS	Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
L625811	u8610	m584	DUMONT	They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
L625810	u8617	m584	TRON	Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
L625809	u8610	m584	DUMONT	No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
L625808	u8617	m584	TRON	Dumont!
L625659	u8610	m584	DUMONT	All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
L625658	u8617	m584	TRON	Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
L625657	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Who is your User, program?
L625656	u8610	m584	DUMONT	When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
L625655	u8617	m584	TRON	Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
L625654	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Hah.
L625653	u8617	m584	TRON	Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
L625652	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
L625651	u8617	m584	TRON	Well I want to communicate --
L625648	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
L625647	u8617	m584	TRON	I... have come to communicate with my User.
L625646	u8610	m584	DUMONT	Yes?
L625754	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
L625753	u8617	m584	TRON	How about you?
L625752	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey... you guys OK?
L625750	u8617	m584	TRON	Yes.
L625749	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Did we make it?
L625729	u8617	m584	TRON	Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
L625728	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Not us, I hope.
L625727	u8617	m584	TRON	Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
L625726	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What about our friend - Sark?
L625722	u8611	m584	FLYNN	All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
L625721	u8617	m584	TRON	We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
L625717	u8617	m584	TRON	Stranger and stranger...
L625716	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
L625715	u8617	m584	TRON	Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
L625714	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
L625713	u8617	m584	TRON	Then...
L625712	u8611	m584	FLYNN	You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
L625711	u8617	m584	TRON	But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
L625708	u8611	m584	FLYNN	It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
L625707	u8617	m584	TRON	Wrote the...?
L625706	u8611	m584	FLYNN	No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
L625703	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
L625702	u8617	m584	TRON	Flynn...  Where's Ram?
L625700	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah, I... oops!
L625699	u8617	m584	TRON	You're alive!
L625698	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Greetings, program...
L625697	u8617	m584	TRON	Flynn!!
L625582	u8617	m584	TRON	No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
L625581	u8611	m584	FLYNN	How about over there...that empty memory?
L625580	u8617	m584	TRON	Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
L625579	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What's that?
L625575	u8611	m584	FLYNN	You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
L625574	u8617	m584	TRON	What, just the three of us?
L625539	u8611	m584	FLYNN	I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
L625538	u8617	m584	TRON	The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
L625537	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Well, isn't it -- ?
L625536	u8617	m584	TRON	Where did you hear that name?
L625535	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Alan!
L625821	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Shhhhh.
L625820	u8618	m584	YORI	Flynn... you can't... I
L625819	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Probably.
L625818	u8618	m584	YORI	But... won't you be de-rezzed?
L625817	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Jump.
L625816	u8618	m584	YORI	Why? What are you going to do?
L625815	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
L625796	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Let's get some power here.
L625795	u8618	m584	YORI	Flynn, we've got to help him!
L625757	u8618	m584	YORI	Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
L625756	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
L625755	u8618	m584	YORI	How did you do that, Flynn?
L625746	u8618	m584	YORI	It's too far!
L625745	u8611	m584	FLYNN	There's another beam!
L625734	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
L625733	u8618	m584	YORI	The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
L625732	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What's wrong with that area?
L625731	u8618	m584	YORI	A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
L625730	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
L625710	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
L625709	u8618	m584	YORI	A User -- in our world?
L625596	u8615	m584	RAM	Little more juice's all it needs...
L625595	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey... !
L625594	u8615	m584	RAM	Come here.
L625593	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
L625590	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
L625589	u8615	m584	RAM	We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
L625588	u8611	m584	FLYNN	What's goin' on?
L625566	u8615	m584	RAM	Alan-One...
L625565	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Feel what? You okay?
L625563	u8611	m584	FLYNN	It grows on you.
L625562	u8615	m584	RAM	PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
L625561	u8611	m584	FLYNN	"Well...my home ""sector"" was called Paramus ..."
L625560	u8615	m584	RAM	The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
L625559	u8611	m584	FLYNN	It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
L625553	u8615	m584	RAM	Recognizers!
L625552	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Watch it!
L625541	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
L625540	u8615	m584	RAM	He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
L625534	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Tron...?
L625533	u8615	m584	RAM	Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
L625514	u8615	m584	RAM	Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
L625513	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
L625512	u8615	m584	RAM	How 'bout yourself?
L625511	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
L625510	u8615	m584	RAM	Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
L625509	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
L625502	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
L625501	u8615	m584	RAM	"You're a...""guest"" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games."
L625500	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
L625499	u8615	m584	RAM	You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
L625844	u8613	m584	LORA	You're getting out of the business?
L625843	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
L625841	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
L625840	u8613	m584	LORA	Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
L625839	u8611	m584	FLYNN	you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
L625463	u8613	m584	LORA	As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
L625462	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
L625461	u8613	m584	LORA	Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
L625433	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
L625432	u8613	m584	LORA	Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
L625429	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
L625428	u8613	m584	LORA	I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
L625413	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
L625412	u8613	m584	LORA	You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
L625409	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
L625408	u8613	m584	LORA	Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
L625407	u8611	m584	FLYNN	So...how's the world of serious science?
L625405	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Good luck. You can't even think in here.
L625404	u8613	m584	LORA	We have to talk.
L625403	u8611	m584	FLYNN	Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
L625694	u8614	m584	MCP	I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
L625693	u8616	m584	SARK	We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
L625692	u8614	m584	MCP	Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
L625691	u8616	m584	SARK	Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
L625690	u8614	m584	MCP	"I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays ""Happy Birthday"" to its User once a year."
L625490	u8614	m584	MCP	End of line.
L625489	u8616	m584	SARK	Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
L625488	u8614	m584	MCP	Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
L625487	u8616	m584	SARK	Wait...I need that...
L625486	u8614	m584	MCP	You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
L625485	u8616	m584	SARK	But-what if I can't...?
L625484	u8614	m584	MCP	Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
L625483	u8616	m584	SARK	Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
L625482	u8614	m584	MCP	That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
L625481	u8616	m584	SARK	A User?
L625480	u8614	m584	MCP	He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
L625479	u8616	m584	SARK	You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
L625478	u8614	m584	MCP	I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
L625477	u8616	m584	SARK	Yes, MCP.
L625279	u8614	m584	MCP	Strategic Air Command.
L625278	u8616	m584	SARK	Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
L625277	u8614	m584	MCP	We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
L625276	u8616	m584	SARK	Thank. you, Master Control.
L625577	u8617	m584	TRON	I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
L625576	u8615	m584	RAM	Do you know what he's talking about?
L625569	u8617	m584	TRON	We have to.
L625568	u8615	m584	RAM	You think we can make it there?
L625549	u8617	m584	TRON	Do it!
L625548	u8615	m584	RAM	What do you think?
L625496	u8617	m584	TRON	They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
L625495	u8615	m584	RAM	The Users...you really think they're still there?
L625494	u8617	m584	TRON	Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
L625493	u8615	m584	RAM	New guy...
L625827	u8617	m584	TRON	Where's Flynn?
L625826	u8618	m584	YORI	It's something Users do.
L625825	u8617	m584	TRON	Nice...
L625744	u8618	m584	YORI	I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
L625743	u8617	m584	TRON	We have to get off this beam!
L625742	u8618	m584	YORI	Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
L625741	u8617	m584	TRON	What is it?
L625705	u8618	m584	YORI	Then I owe you some thanks...
L625704	u8617	m584	TRON	This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
L625687	u8617	m584	TRON	As long as it gets us out of here
L625686	u8618	m584	YORI	Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
L625635	u8617	m584	TRON	I had to...in the games...
L625634	u8618	m584	YORI	You've grown, big program.
L625631	u8618	m584	YORI	It's a flat. But wait a micro...
L625630	u8617	m584	TRON	Why is everything...like this?
L625629	u8618	m584	YORI	My quarters.
L625628	u8617	m584	TRON	Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
L625627	u8618	m584	YORI	How?
L625626	u8617	m584	TRON	That's all going to change, Yori...
L625625	u8618	m584	YORI	I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
L625621	u8618	m584	YORI	Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
L625620	u8617	m584	TRON	Yori... hey...
L657837	u8928	m608	AIRK	Let's go.
L657836	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Thank you, friend.
L657835	u8928	m608	AIRK	Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
L657834	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
L657782	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Just get me some horses.
L657781	u8928	m608	AIRK	You're chasing a dream.
L657779	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Then come with us.
L657778	u8928	m608	AIRK	You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
L657769	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	They're not after me.  They want the baby.
L657768	u8928	m608	AIRK	It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
L657763	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Is this what's left of your army?
L657762	u8928	m608	AIRK	You managed alright.
L657761	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	You left me to die, friend.
L657369	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
L657368	u8928	m608	AIRK	Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
L657367	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
L657365	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
L657364	u8928	m608	AIRK	I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
L657363	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
L657362	u8928	m608	AIRK	Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
L657361	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	He thought you were a woman, Airk!
L657360	u8928	m608	AIRK	We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
L657457	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
L657456	u8937	m608	WILLOW	They look like acorns.
L657454	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
L657453	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
L657452	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
L657451	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	You are very important, Willow.
L657450	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
L657449	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
L657446	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What is Tir Asleen?
L657445	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
L657444	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Me?
L657443	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
L657441	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
L657440	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
L657434	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
L657433	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Yes...?
L657432	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	Willow Ufgood.
L657291	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
L657290	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
L657289	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Go in the direction the bird is flying.
L657288	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
L657287	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
L657286	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
L657285	u8937	m608	WILLOW	If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
L657284	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
L657256	u8937	m608	WILLOW	My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
L657255	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
L657238	u8937	m608	WILLOW	It's a matter of great importance to me!
L657237	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Not today, Willow.
L657236	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Sir!  I have to talk to you.
L657890	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I have no family.
L657889	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
L657824	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Madmartigan.
L657823	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Sorsha.
L657743	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I don't believe you.
L657742	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Because it's true.
L657741	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I love you.
L657740	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Say what?
L657739	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Why did you say that?
L657736	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I'm not going to let this baby die.
L657735	u8935	m608	SORSHA	You're a fool.  Now put her back.
L657704	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Too bad you're not more like your father.
L657703	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I do what I'm told.
L657633	u8935	m608	SORSHA	My step-father's going to tear you apart.
L657632	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
L657513	u8935	m608	SORSHA	You're not a woman.
L657512	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Gawd...you're...beautiful...
L657508	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Why not?
L657507	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Why not?
L657506	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I can't.
L657504	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Let me see it.
L657503	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I can't.
L657501	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	No.  I mean yes.
L657500	u8935	m608	SORSHA	You!  Are you the mother of that child?
L657877	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
L657876	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
L657651	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	As above, so below.
L657650	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	We're a tiny version of all that?
L657636	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
L657635	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Who is that girl, anyway?
L657621	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	I will!  But I need help!
L657620	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Then you get us out of here.
L657616	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	He turned that monster into stone!
L657615	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	He's no magician.
L657614	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
L657887	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
L657886	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I don't know, Willow.
L657882	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
L657881	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
L657880	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
L657796	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Ahhh!
L657795	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Watch it!
L657794	u8937	m608	WILLOW	That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
L657793	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	She's a bird, Willow.
L657792	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
L657791	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
L657789	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
L657788	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Want me to carry Elora?
L657787	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
L657696	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
L657695	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You?
L657685	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
L657684	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	She's in love.
L657682	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Well what did she say?
L657681	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She asked about you, Madmartigan.
L657680	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow!
L657679	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She said lots of thing.s
L657678	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
L657677	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Who?
L657676	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Did she ask about me?
L657649	u8937	m608	WILLOW	The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
L657648	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
L657623	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I won't.
L657622	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'll help you...!
L657550	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
L657549	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You?
L657548	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
L657542	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
L657541	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan, I need your help.
L657539	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
L657538	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
L657537	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
L657531	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I did?
L657530	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
L657529	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
L657528	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Elora Danan!
L657527	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
L657525	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I thought you had her!
L657524	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Where's the baby??
L657510	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Because she's sick.
L657509	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Because she's sick.
L657499	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Time to leave.
L657498	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Time to change her diaper.
L657495	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Nursemaid?!
L657494	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
L657493	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Hey!  Give me that baby!
L657486	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Where the hell did you come from?
L657485	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You!!
L657388	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
L657387	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
L657385	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Of course!  I promise!
L657384	u8937	m608	WILLOW	And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
L657383	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Absolutely!
L657382	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Fresh goat's milk.
L657381	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I will.
L657380	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You gotta promise to feed her.
L657377	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You don't know anything about ba- bies.
L657376	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
L657375	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I hate this.
L657374	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
L657372	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Friend of yours?
L657371	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
L657354	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What is it?
L657353	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	You hear trouble.
L657352	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What's that?  I hear something!
L657351	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
L657350	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Are you a warrior?
L657349	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Smells like a battle.
L657343	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
L657342	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You all right?
L657335	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
L657334	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Farmer.
L657333	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	You a woodcutter?
L657329	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I don't know.
L657328	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
L657327	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Are you okay?
L657326	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Thanks for your help, Peck.
L657320	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
L657319	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Hey!  Somebody's coming!
L657316	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I have to give this baby to some- body.
L657315	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Why.
L657314	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
L657312	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Miserable Pecks.
L657311	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
L657310	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Don't make me angry, Peck.
L657309	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Good.  How long will it take?
L657308	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
L657283	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
L657282	u8932	m608	RANON	I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
L657281	u8932	m608	RANON	Are you scared?
L657280	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
L657279	u8932	m608	RANON	Dada, what's a daikini?
L657207	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Absolutely not.
L657206	u8932	m608	RANON	Can't we keep it, Dada?
L657203	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
L657202	u8932	m608	RANON	It's not a Nelwyn baby.
L657900	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Courage, Willow.
L657899	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Patience, Willow.
L657896	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Surrender!!
L657895	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Time is running out.
L657865	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She's too powerful, Raziel
L657864	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
L657863	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
L657853	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Just do it!
L657852	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Why?
L657851	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
L657816	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
L657815	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
L657812	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	More!  More!
L657811	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
L657809	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
L657808	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How??
L657805	u8937	m608	WILLOW	There's nobody here.
L657804	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Tir Asleen.
L657722	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
L657721	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I just wanted to test it first.
L657720	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Now use it.
L657719	u8937	m608	WILLOW	His will.
L657718	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
L657716	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
L657715	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What'd you bit me for!!
L657714	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Shhhhh!
L657713	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Ouch!!
L657712	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
L657711	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Oooh, this smells terrible.
L657694	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Me!
L657693	u8937	m608	WILLOW	But what am I gonna transform??
L657692	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	The art of transformation!
L657691	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
L657690	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
L657689	u8937	m608	WILLOW	The limitless power of...
L657688	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	What's the magician's weapon?
L657687	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
L657686	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
L657655	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
L657654	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How am I gonna do that?
L657653	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Burn it to a fine ash.
L657652	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm all finished.  Now what?
L657647	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
L657646	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
L657645	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
L657644	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
L657640	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
L657639	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What do I need for that?
L657638	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
L657626	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Then I will teach you.
L657625	u8937	m608	WILLOW	That's all I ever wanted!
L657624	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	You must learn magic.
L657619	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
L657618	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No.
L657617	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Did *you* give that acorn its power?
L657597	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Kill him!
L657596	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No!
L657595	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Kill him!
L657586	u8937	m608	WILLOW	We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
L657585	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	What do you want!
L657581	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
L657580	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Who are you!  Who are you!
L657612	u8934	m608	ROOL	Ouch!  Let go of me!
L657611	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Get back here, Rool!
L657610	u8934	m608	ROOL	Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
L657609	u8936	m608	TEEMO	We gotta follow them.
L657556	u8934	m608	ROOL	Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
L657555	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Are you sure?
L657474	u8934	m608	ROOL	Me neither!
L657473	u8936	m608	TEEMO	I'm not going in there.
L657417	u8934	m608	ROOL	He never misses.
L657416	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
L657411	u8934	m608	ROOL	Somebody has to do it.
L657410	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
L657670	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Here.  Hold her.
L657669	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
L657668	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She's hungry.
L657665	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I don't know much about him.
L657664	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Who is he?
L657663	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan.
L657662	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Who is that horrible friend of yours?
L657661	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
L657660	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I changed her already!
L657659	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She needs to be changed.
L657631	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Shut up.
L657630	u8937	m608	WILLOW	If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
L657584	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
L657583	u8937	m608	WILLOW	This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
L657576	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
L657575	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Obviously.
L657568	u8936	m608	TEEMO	The sorceress.
L657567	u8937	m608	WILLOW	We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
L657560	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How are we going to get out there?
L657559	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
L657468	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
L657467	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Hey, careful there!
L657436	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I can't see anything--she's too bright!
L657435	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Talk!  Say something!
L657429	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
L657428	u8937	m608	WILLOW	This is not going well.
L657424	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Why not?
L657423	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
L657422	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Ohhh, I hate this.
L657415	u8936	m608	TEEMO	No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
L657414	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm getting her out of there!
L657408	u8936	m608	TEEMO	You're the guardian, aren't you?
L657407	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Who??
L657406	u8936	m608	TEEMO	She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
L657405	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Queen Cherlindrea?
L657404	u8936	m608	TEEMO	We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
L660491	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
L660490	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
L660483	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L660482	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
L660481	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
L660477	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Yes, darling.
L660476	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
L660475	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
L660474	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
L659471	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
L659470	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!
L659442	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
L659441	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659440	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
L659439	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
L659385	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- all right.
L659384	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
L659383	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
L659382	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
L659379	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
L659378	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
L659377	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
L659376	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
L659375	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Aunt Em!
L659465	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
L659464	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Uhh -- yeah --
L659390	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659389	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, I hope we got them in time.
L659388	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659387	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
L659386	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
L659431	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
L659430	u8952	m610	HICKORY	All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
L659429	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
L659428	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
L659427	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
L659426	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
L659605	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	You'll be hist...
L659604	u8955	m610	MAYOR	From now on you'll be history
L659596	u8955	m610	MAYOR	Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
L659595	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	If any!
L659594	u8955	m610	MAYOR	Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
L659589	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	Is morally, ethic'ly
L659588	u8955	m610	MAYOR	If she?
L659587	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	If she...
L659586	u8955	m610	MAYOR	To see?
L659585	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	But we've got to verify it legally To see...
L659584	u8955	m610	MAYOR	As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
L660354	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	You are?
L660353	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
L660352	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Who are you?
L660351	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	... -- Oz -- has spoken!
L660342	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Do you presume to criticize the....
L660341	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
L660334	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Not so fast!  Not....
L660333	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
L660332	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	...resourceful!
L660330	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Oh ....
L660329	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
L660328	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	...have you come back?
L660087	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
L660086	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
L660085	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
L660084	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Our echo.
L660440	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Goodbye, folks!
L660439	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L660438	u8964	m610	WIZARD	I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
L660437	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
L660427	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
L660426	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh!
L660425	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
L660361	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh ....
L660360	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
L660357	u8964	m610	WIZARD	No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
L660356	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't believe you!
L660355	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uhhhh -- yes...
L659423	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
L659422	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Are you all right, Dorothy?
L659421	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
L659415	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
L659414	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Hickory!
L659413	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Who did it? Now wait a minute.
L659412	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!
L659411	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
L659410	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	This?
L659409	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
L659408	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
L659407	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
L660212	u8963	m610	WITCH	Catch him, you fool!
L660211	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Run, Toto, run!
L660208	u8963	m610	WITCH	No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
L660207	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
L660206	u8963	m610	WITCH	Ahh!  Ah!
L660205	u8963	m610	WITCH	That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
L660204	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
L660203	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
L660202	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
L660201	u8963	m610	WITCH	Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
L660200	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, please give me back my dog!
L660199	u8963	m610	WITCH	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
L660198	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
L659620	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
L659619	u8963	m610	WITCH	...didn't you?
L660472	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
L660471	u8951	m610	GLINDA	"And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."""
L660470	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
L660469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm ready now.
L660468	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
L660467	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you ready now?
L660462	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
L660461	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Whenever you wish.
L660460	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now?
L660459	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Toto, too.
L660458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...Toto, too?
L660448	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have?
L660447	u8951	m610	GLINDA	You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
L660446	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
L659644	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
L659643	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But, how do I start for Emerald City?
L659642	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
L659641	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, I'm afraid I didn't.
L659640	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
L659639	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
L659638	u8951	m610	GLINDA	No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
L659637	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
L659636	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
L659615	u8951	m610	GLINDA	That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
L659614	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I thought you said she was dead.
L659565	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
L659564	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
L659563	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
L659557	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
L659556	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Toto's my dog.
L659554	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh!  Well....
L659553	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
L659552	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
L660489	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But you couldn't have been, could you?
L660488	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- 
L659533	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
L659532	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
L659531	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
L659530	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you....
L659529	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
L659528	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- no!
L659527	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...bed.
L659526	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
L659525	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...paper?
L659524	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Has it poppies on the wall....
L659523	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...room --
L659521	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What's she doing now?
L659520	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Uh-huh.
L659519	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
L659517	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Me?
L659516	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
L659515	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659514	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
L659513	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's right.  What's she doing?
L659512	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Her -- her name is Emily.
L659511	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...That's Aunt Em.
L659510	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...her face is careworn.
L659507	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- yes.
L659506	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's our farm!
L659499	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
L659498	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
L659497	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659496	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, they won't - honestly.
L659495	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Aw, come, come, come --
L659494	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
L659493	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659492	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
L659491	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
L659488	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
L659487	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Yes --
L659486	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
L659485	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
L659484	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why --
L659483	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
L659482	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How did you guess?
L659481	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
L659473	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Stop her!
L659472	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
L659469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
L659468	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
L659467	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659466	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Now you're seeing reason.
L659458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
L659457	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
L660464	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
L660463	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
L660405	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Look -- it ticks!
L660404	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.
L660403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...!
L660402	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
L660337	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	You've had plenty of time already!
L660336	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
L660279	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I knew you would!
L660278	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Dorothy!
L660156	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
L660155	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh! Something bit me, too!
L660147	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
L660146	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No.  Why only --  Oh --
L660070	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
L660069	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, he's just ascared again.
L659992	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659991	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Can't that female take no for an answer?
L659881	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sure he could give you some courage.
L659880	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And him a brain.
L659853	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
L659852	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What sort of an animal is that?
L659851	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And bears!
L659835	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659834	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	We might.
L659825	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
L659824	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
L659811	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh-oh-
L659810	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!

L659805	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
L659804	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
L659803	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh! They're - they're gone now.

L659792	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
L659791	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
L659788	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
L659787	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
L659786	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
L659785	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
L659778	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	All hollow.  Oh --

L659770	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, you're perfect now.
L659769	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
L659768	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
L659767	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
L659766	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---

L660466	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I think I'll miss you most of all.
L660465	u8954	m610	LION	Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
L660444	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
L660443	u8954	m610	LION	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
L660442	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now I'll never get home!
L660409	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.

L660276	u8954	m610	LION	Did they hurtcha?
L660275	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
L660166	u8954	m610	LION	I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
L660165	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
L660164	u8954	m610	LION	As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
L660160	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
L660159	u8954	m610	LION	That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
L660138	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L660137	u8954	m610	LION	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
L660136	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Does it work?
L660121	u8954	m610	LION	Huh?  What'd he say?

L660076	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, come on.
L660075	u8954	m610	LION	Because I'm still scared!
L660074	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But why?  Why?
L660073	u8954	m610	LION	I'd sooner wait outside.
L660072	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
L660071	u8954	m610	LION	I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
L660043	u8954	m610	LION	I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
L660042	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Supposin' you met an elephant?
L660041	u8954	m610	LION	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
L660040	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How about a hippopotamus?
L660037	u8954	m610	LION	Not nobody, not nohow!
L660036	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
L660023	u8954	m610	LION	In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
L660022	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'll be home in time for supper!
L660010	u8954	m610	LION	And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
L660009	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
L659990	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
L659989	u8954	m610	LION	Who's her?  Who's her?
L659986	u8954	m610	LION	Hah!
L659985	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
L659939	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
L659938	u8954	m610	LION	Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
L659904	u8954	m610	LION	Yes.
L659903	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes -- let's run!
L659901	u8954	m610	LION	Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
L659900	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
L659894	u8954	m610	LION	The nerve.
L659893	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	A home --
L659887	u8954	m610	LION	Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
L659886	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.
L659885	u8954	m610	LION	...has been simply unbearable.
L659873	u8954	m610	LION	You're right -- I am a coward.
L659872	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
L659871	u8954	m610	LION	Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
L659870	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
L659869	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, but you tried to.
L659868	u8954	m610	LION	What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
L659425	u8953	m610	HUNK	What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
L659424	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
L659406	u8953	m610	HUNK	Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
L659405	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
L659404	u8953	m610	HUNK	Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
L659403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have so got brains.
L659402	u8953	m610	HUNK	Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
L660304	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
L660303	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
L660302	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	No -- No -- No -- No!

L660157	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
L660149	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh -- are you -- are you all right?

L660058	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
L660057	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
L660056	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659999	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
L659998	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Dear, whatever shall we do?
L659943	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
L659942	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
L659941	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
L659940	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- there --
L659937	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659936	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
L659914	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
L659913	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...along.
L659879	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
L659878	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
L659833	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
L659832	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
L659831	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
L659823	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
L659822	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
L659819	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
L659818	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
L659790	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
L659789	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
L659760	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes --- there.
L659759	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	The other side....
L659758	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Here -- here --
L659757	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	He said his mouth.
L659754	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
L659753	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oil can what?
L659749	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Oh -- look --
L659748	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What?
L659747	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
L659746	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659745	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
L659735	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
L659734	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
L659726	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz!
L659725	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	To Oz?
L659724	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
L659723	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
L659722	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
L659720	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
L659719	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't blame you for that.
L659718	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
L659717	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
L659716	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- that's true.
L659715	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
L659714	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
L659713	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659712	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You're going to see a Wizard?
L659711	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
L659710	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Where's Kansas?
L659709	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659708	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They would?
L659707	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
L659695	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
L659694	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Did I scare you?
L659693	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
L659692	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...free!
L659691	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	My, it's good to be....
L659690	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh --
L659689	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
L659688	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- does it hurt you?
L659687	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
L659686	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohh!
L659685	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Ohhhh --
L659684	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.

L659679	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
L659678	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
L659661	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It's pleasant down that way, too.
L659660	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...don't talk.
L659632	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
L659631	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
L659630	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
L659626	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's too late!  There they....

L659622	u8951	m610	GLINDA	...ting the ruby slippers?
L659618	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
L659617	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Leave her alone!
L659616	u8963	m610	WITCH	Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
L660422	u8954	m610	LION	It did?
L660421	u8964	m610	WIZARD	...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.

L660271	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Stop pushing!
L660260	u8954	m610	LION	Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
L660259	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on -- I've got another idea.

L660067	u8954	m610	LION	Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.

L660044	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What if it were a brontosaurus?

L659454	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	No, her dog!
L659453	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	You mean she bit you?
L659452	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
L659451	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
L659450	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	... about Dorothy.

L660231	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
L660230	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
L660224	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on, fellows!

L660187	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, that's you all over.
L660186	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!

L659930	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
L659929	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes.
L659928	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Let's.
L659927	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I don't think I could, but we could try.
L659926	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
L659923	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
L659922	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
L659918	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Dorothy!

L659905	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on -- come on --
L659892	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	A heart --
L659891	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Then I'm sure to get a brain --
L659889	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'd be clever as a gizzard --
L659888	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'd be gentle as a lizard --
L659837	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
L659836	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Animals that -- that eat straw?
L659829	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	To Oz!
L659828	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz?
L659827	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	We do.
L659826	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	That's right.
L659821	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	No, sir!
L659820	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No, sir!
L659802	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
L659801	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
L659774	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
L659773	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Beautiful!  What an echo!
L660392	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
L660391	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	How can I ever thank you enough?
L660388	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Th.D.?
L660387	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
L660381	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You promised us real things -- a real...
L660380	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well --
L660373	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660372	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
L660371	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660370	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
L660369	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660368	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about us?
L660367	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes.
L660366	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It makes you nervous?
L660365	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
L660436	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Help!
L660435	u8964	m610	WIZARD	-- Ruined my exit!
L660434	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
L660433	u8964	m610	WIZARD	This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
L660432	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Stop that dog!
L660398	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes -- ....
L660397	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	But I still want one.
L660396	u8964	m610	WIZARD	As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
L663196	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	So isn?t it time you unwrapped your present?
L663195	u8965	m611	BOND	I love Christmas in Turkey.
L663192	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	We can?t.
L663191	u8965	m611	BOND	We?ve got to get out.
L663180	u8965	m611	BOND	Count to twenty.  I?ll be there.
L663179	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	But what if...
L663178	u8965	m611	BOND	Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we?ll sink.
L663171	u8965	m611	BOND	Just wanted to put him on edge...
L663170	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What kind of bikes did you ride?
L663169	u8965	m611	BOND	Like riding a bike.
L663168	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Do you know what you?re doing?
L663167	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	He?s going to insert the plutonium.
L663166	u8965	m611	BOND	He?s sealed himself in.
L663156	u8965	m611	BOND	We go down to the torpedo bay.
L663155	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Is there another way?
L663103	u8965	m611	BOND	If I don?t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden?s Tower, M is dead.
L663102	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Zukovsky...
L663073	u8965	m611	BOND	Elektra would control it all.
L663072	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	The King pipeline.
L663071	u8965	m611	BOND	Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
L663070	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
L663067	u8965	m611	BOND	Made to look just like an accident.
L663066	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He?s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub?s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
L663065	u8965	m611	BOND	Nuclear.
L662988	u8965	m611	BOND	She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M?s life is part of the bet.
L662987	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What is it?
L662979	u8965	m611	BOND	I was hoping you could tell me.
L662978	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
L662977	u8965	m611	BOND	Makes her look even more innocent.
L662976	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
L662975	u8965	m611	BOND	Elektra King.
L662974	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Who?s she?
L662973	u8965	m611	BOND	It?s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
L662972	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What the hell are you talking about?
L662971	u8965	m611	BOND	I did kill us. She thinks we?re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
L662970	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
L662953	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	It?s a bomb alright. We?re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
L662952	u8965	m611	BOND	Then it?s no longer a bomb?
L662951	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	The plutonium is missing.  They?ve taken the core!
L662945	u8965	m611	BOND	Alright then, brunch.
L662944	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
L662943	u8965	m611	BOND	When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
L662880	u8965	m611	BOND	With this?
L662879	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	They won?t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
L662877	u8965	m611	BOND	Bond --
L662876	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	So who are you?
L662875	u8965	m611	BOND	Shame you had to spot I wasn?t the real thing.
L662865	u8965	m611	BOND	Here?s your imposter. He?s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They?re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they?re flying it wherever he tells them.
L662864	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	He is an impostor.  There?s no Davidov at Miratom.
L662836	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren?t around, they?d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
L662835	u8965	m611	BOND	Couldn?t make it. Splitting headache.
L662834	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What happened to Len Tashka?
L662833	u8965	m611	BOND	Don?t know any doctor jokes.
L662832	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I?ve heard them all.
L662831	u8965	m611	BOND	Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
L662830	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	You new?
L662605	u8965	m611	BOND	I could come for a second opinion?
L662604	u8967	m611	DOCTOR GREATREX	...yes?...
L662603	u8965	m611	BOND	Perhaps after this ... test?
L662602	u8967	m611	DOCTOR GREATREX	Then maybe I?d be... open to that.
L662598	u8967	m611	DOCTOR GREATREX	James.  It wouldn?t really be...
L662597	u8965	m611	BOND	It?s just a scratch.
L662596	u8965	m611	BOND	I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
L662595	u8967	m611	DOCTOR GREATREX	Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won?t just be two weeks out of action.
L662921	u8965	m611	BOND	Is maybe...the inside woman.
L662920	u8970	m611	M	The inside man?
L662919	u8965	m611	BOND	They?re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can?t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
L662918	u8970	m611	M	Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
L662917	u8965	m611	BOND	The report King bought. It?s a manual. Renard?s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
L662651	u8965	m611	BOND	The worm on the hook again.
L662650	u8970	m611	M	Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn?t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
L662647	u8965	m611	BOND	He?s not through yet. Renard doesn?t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there?s more coming in. He?s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
L662646	u8970	m611	M	Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
L662645	u8965	m611	BOND	?That which does not kill me makes me stronger.?
L662644	u8970	m611	M	The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
L662643	u8970	m611	M	The doctor who saved him couldn?t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he?s a dead man.
L662642	u8965	m611	BOND	He survived?
L662640	u8970	m611	M	How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I?d do the same again.
L662639	u8965	m611	BOND	Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
L662638	u8970	m611	M	Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra?s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
L662637	u8965	m611	BOND	Renard.
L662636	u8970	m611	M	Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
L662635	u8965	m611	BOND	Who?
L662634	u8970	m611	M	It?s a message.  He wants us to know he?s back.
L662632	u8965	m611	BOND	The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
L662631	u8970	m611	M	I?m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
L662630	u8965	m611	BOND	I was the one who brought that money in...
L662629	u8970	m611	M	You haven?t been given an assignment in this case.
L662628	u8965	m611	BOND	I took the initiative.
L662627	u8970	m611	M	Who told you to look at Elektra?s files?
L662613	u8970	m611	M	And now it?s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
L662612	u8965	m611	BOND	Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
L662611	u8970	m611	M	007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
L662593	u8970	m611	M	Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
L662592	u8965	m611	BOND	It?s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
L662591	u8970	m611	M	I?ve scheduled a medical for you.
L662590	u8965	m611	BOND	She?s not a girl anymore.
L662589	u8970	m611	M	Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I?ve known that girl all her life. I?m not sure she knows what she?s walking into.
L662566	u8965	m611	BOND	Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
L662565	u8970	m611	M	Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He?s a man of great integrity.
L662564	u8965	m611	BOND	Old friend?
L662563	u8970	m611	M	Quite the opposite, in fact.
L662562	u8965	m611	BOND	Construction?s not exactly my line.
L662549	u8969	m611	LACHAISE	I can?t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
L662548	u8965	m611	BOND	The name?
L662546	u8969	m611	LACHAISE	Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
L662545	u8965	m611	BOND	Your last chance. Give me the name.
L662544	u8969	m611	LACHAISE	Your last chance. Take the money.
L662543	u8965	m611	BOND	And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
L662542	u8969	m611	LACHAISE	I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
L662541	u8965	m611	BOND	Who did you get it from?
L662540	u8969	m611	LACHAISE	I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
L662532	u8965	m611	BOND	Which is neutral, no doubt.
L662531	u8969	m611	LACHAISE	Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
L663163	u8965	m611	BOND	Haven?t you heard the news?  So is she.
L663162	u8971	m611	RENARD	In case you?ve forgotten.  I?m dead already.
L662859	u8971	m611	RENARD	You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn?t have done it without you.
L662858	u8965	m611	BOND	She?ll get over it.
L662857	u8971	m611	RENARD	It?s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
L662856	u8965	m611	BOND	Consider me ungrateful.
L662855	u8971	m611	RENARD	Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
L662854	u8965	m611	BOND	You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
L662853	u8971	m611	RENARD	You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She?s beautiful isn?t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
L662852	u8965	m611	BOND	Who is it?
L662851	u8971	m611	RENARD	Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
L662850	u8965	m611	BOND	Revenge isn?t so hard to fathom. What?s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
L662844	u8965	m611	BOND	Indeed.
L662843	u8971	m611	RENARD	I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
L662586	u8973	m611	WOMAN	He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
L662585	u8965	m611	BOND	I?m sorry.
L662584	u8973	m611	WOMAN	He was my father.
L662583	u8965	m611	BOND	You knew him well?
L662582	u8973	m611	WOMAN	A word? I?m sure by now he?s engineered a hostile takeover.
L662581	u8965	m611	BOND	Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
L662580	u8973	m611	WOMAN	Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
L662579	u8965	m611	BOND	Yes.
L662578	u8973	m611	WOMAN	Beautiful, isn?t it?
L663134	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Oh James.
L663133	u8965	m611	BOND	One... last... screw?
L663130	u8965	m611	BOND	Elektra, it?s not too late.  Eight million people needn?t die.
L663129	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Know what happens when a man is strangled?
L663126	u8965	m611	BOND	No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
L663125	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I?m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather?s name, the glory of my people.
L663124	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	It is my oil!  Mine and my family?s!
L663123	u8965	m611	BOND	Was this all about the oil?
L663122	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
L663121	u8965	m611	BOND	So you killed your father.
L663119	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Just like you...only you were even easier.
L663118	u8965	m611	BOND	You turned Renard.
L663117	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Since I was a child, I?ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn?t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
L663116	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Five more turns and your neck will break.
L663115	u8965	m611	BOND	All this, because you fell for Renard?
L663114	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Soon she?ll be everywhere.
L663113	u8965	m611	BOND	Where?s M?
L663111	u8965	m611	BOND	Not interested.
L663110	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I could have given you the world.
L662912	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	You do what you have to do, but I?ve called in M.  She?s en route from London even now.
L662911	u8965	m611	BOND	I?m coming with you.
L662909	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
L662908	u8965	m611	BOND	He used your exact words.
L662907	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn?t have to sleep with you to find that out.
L662905	u8965	m611	BOND	I think you do.
L662904	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I don?t know what you?re talking about!
L662903	u8965	m611	BOND	You can drop the act, it?s over.
L662902	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Are you saying...Renard is the man who?s trying to kill me?
L662901	u8965	m611	BOND	We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
L662900	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	...what?
L662899	u8965	m611	BOND	Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
L662898	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	What are you talking about?
L662897	u8965	m611	BOND	A little. Does it matter? After all, what?s the point of living if you can?t feel alive?  Isn?t that right, Elektra? Isn?t that your motto?
L662896	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	What?s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
L662816	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I?ve never told anyone that.
L662815	u8965	m611	BOND	How did you survive?
L662809	u8965	m611	BOND	Shush.
L662808	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
L662799	u8965	m611	BOND	Not at that price. Time to surrender.
L662798	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Surely you believe in living dangerously.
L662783	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Really?
L662782	u8965	m611	BOND	I understand it?s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
L662777	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	You had your chance, James. Now I?m looking for a bigger thrill.
L662776	u8965	m611	BOND	If this little show is for my benefit, I?ll take you home right now.
L662775	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Someone wants to kill me, I?d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
L662774	u8965	m611	BOND	What the hell are you doing here?
L662773	u8965	m611	BOND	Two. Shaken not stirred.
L662772	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Vodka martini.
L662744	u8965	m611	BOND	I have to go to work.
L662743	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I don?t want to be safe!
L662742	u8965	m611	BOND	No. You?ll be safe here.
L662741	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Then take me with you.
L662740	u8965	m611	BOND	I have to go.
L662739	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	James...
L662738	u8965	m611	BOND	...you should rest.
L662737	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	What is it?
L662736	u8965	m611	BOND	I think you?re one of the bravest people I?ve ever met.
L662735	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I?m a coward.
L662729	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I know.
L662728	u8965	m611	BOND	I can?t stay.
L662723	u8965	m611	BOND	It?s the only way out...
L662722	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	No!  It will cave in!
L662721	u8965	m611	BOND	You?re not going to.
L662720	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I can?t stay here.
L662719	u8965	m611	BOND	We?re alright.
L662718	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Oh my God...we?re buried alive...
L662708	u8965	m611	BOND	No.
L662707	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	You don?t take no for an answer, do you?
L662706	u8965	m611	BOND	Always wanted to see the upper lines.
L662705	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
L662698	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
L662697	u8965	m611	BOND	I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King?s daughter.
L662696	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	That?s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That?s why you?re here, isn?t it? You think I can?t do it. You think I?m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
L662695	u8965	m611	BOND	The killer doesn?t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn?t want to see you take over...
L662694	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	If you?ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don?t need a third...
L662693	u8965	m611	BOND	It?s not the pin your father wore. It?s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
L662692	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
L662691	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	It?s my father?s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
L662690	u8965	m611	BOND	Does this look familiar to you?
L662689	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
L662688	u8965	m611	BOND	How long has he been with you?
L662687	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He?s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
L662686	u8965	m611	BOND	Who is he?
L662683	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Partially, yes.
L662682	u8965	m611	BOND	Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
L662681	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don?t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I?m not sure he knew that.
L662680	u8965	m611	BOND	Funerals aren?t exactly memorable.
L662679	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I haven?t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
L662678	u8965	m611	BOND	Yes.
L662677	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	I met you at my father?s funeral.
L663101	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	I?d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
L663100	u8965	m611	BOND	How appropriate.
L663099	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	The Maiden?s Tower.
L663069	u8965	m611	BOND	The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
L663068	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Mother of God.
L663043	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Istanbul.
L663042	u8965	m611	BOND	Where?
L663041	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
L663036	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
L663035	u8965	m611	BOND	This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
L663034	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	No!  Get me out!
L663033	u8965	m611	BOND	Where?s the sub going?!
L663030	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
L663029	u8965	m611	BOND	And the payoff on the tables?
L663028	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
L663024	u8965	m611	BOND	No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
L663023	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	A rope!
L663022	u8965	m611	BOND	Now...where were we?
L663018	u8965	m611	BOND	You are out of your league.  She?s working with Renard.
L663017	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
L663016	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
L663015	u8965	m611	BOND	She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn?t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
L663014	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	I thought you were the one in her business.
L663013	u8965	m611	BOND	What?s your business with Elektra King?
L663012	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Really Bond, couldn?t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
L663011	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
L663010	u8965	m611	BOND	She?s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
L663009	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
L662766	u8965	m611	BOND	But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
L662765	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
L662764	u8965	m611	BOND	How high up does this...arms dealing go?
L662763	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
L662761	u8965	m611	BOND	Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
L662760	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Where did you get this?
L662759	u8965	m611	BOND	If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
L662758	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	What?  This is not possible.
L662757	u8965	m611	BOND	How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
L662756	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	See?  You?re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
L662751	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Have some of the rat?s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
L662750	u8965	m611	BOND	Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat?s nest.
L662749	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Bond, I?m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family?s, now it?s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
L662748	u8965	m611	BOND	You, of course. I need some information.
L662747	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
L662746	u8965	m611	BOND	Valentin Zukovsky.
L663064	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	C-class.
L663063	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What class sub does your nephew run?
L663062	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
L663059	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
L663058	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What is this place?
L663038	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	Bond!
L663037	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	No! Bond!
L663032	u8974	m611	ZUKOVSKY	To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
L663031	u8966	m611	CHRISTMAS	What?
L663087	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
L663086	u8970	m611	M	Someone will come.
L663085	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they?re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
L663001	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
L663000	u8970	m611	M	Your father...
L662999	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn?t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
L662965	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Please.
L662964	u8970	m611	M	Perhaps this isn?t the time...
L662890	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Could...could you come?
L662889	u8970	m611	M	I?ll send someone out.
L663141	u8971	m611	RENARD	Yes.  Au revoir...
L663140	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Everything?s under control up here.  Are you ready?
L663093	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
L663092	u8971	m611	RENARD	This is the end.
L663049	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	What do you think?
L663048	u8971	m611	RENARD	He was a...good lover?
L663047	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Of course...
L663046	u8971	m611	RENARD	Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It?s what you wanted.
L663045	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	How would you know?
L663044	u8971	m611	RENARD	So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
L662994	u8971	m611	RENARD	Is it?
L662993	u8968	m611	ELEKTRA	Warm.
L663194	u8972	m611	TANNER	Still no contact yet.
L663193	u8970	m611	M	Any word from him?
L662931	u8970	m611	M	Where it can do the most damage.
L662930	u8972	m611	TANNER	It?s heading for the oil terminal.
L662929	u8970	m611	M	The parcel?s in the post.
L662883	u8970	m611	M	Marvellous.
L662882	u8972	m611	TANNER	Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
L662881	u8970	m611	M	Do we have the range of Renard?s plane?
L662609	u8972	m611	TANNER	And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
L662608	u8970	m611	M	We?ve been pawns in someone?s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
L665331	u9000	m613	XANDER	You're a jerk-off, you know that?
L665330	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
L665329	u9000	m613	XANDER	No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
L665328	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
L665327	u9000	m613	XANDER	Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
L665326	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
L665325	u9000	m613	XANDER	Who says you're the good guys?
L665324	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
L665323	u9000	m613	XANDER	But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
L665322	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
L665321	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
L665320	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
L665247	u9000	m613	XANDER	We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
L665246	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
L665245	u9000	m613	XANDER	Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
L665244	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
L665243	u9000	m613	XANDER	Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
L665242	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
L665241	u9000	m613	XANDER	Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
L665240	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Yes it does.
L665239	u9000	m613	XANDER	"They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that ""classified"" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song ""Silent Night"" mean anything to you?"
L665238	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
L665237	u9000	m613	XANDER	Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
L665162	u9000	m613	XANDER	You ain't seen nothing yet.
L665161	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
L665160	u9000	m613	XANDER	Thanks.
L665159	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
L665158	u9000	m613	XANDER	Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
L665157	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	"This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this ""Ahab""."
L665156	u9000	m613	XANDER	Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
L665155	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	"You did say ""Ahab""? You're sure about that?"
L664955	u9000	m613	XANDER	I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
L664954	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
L664953	u9000	m613	XANDER	Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
L664952	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
L664951	u9000	m613	XANDER	What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
L664950	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	We're not after car thieves here.
L664949	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
L664948	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
L664947	u9000	m613	XANDER	Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
L664946	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
L664945	u9000	m613	XANDER	I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
L664869	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Just remember, I'll be watching.
L664868	u9000	m613	XANDER	Is that all?
L664867	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
L664866	u9000	m613	XANDER	Up yours.
L664863	u9000	m613	XANDER	Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
L664862	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
L664859	u9000	m613	XANDER	Yeah, I spy or I die.
L664858	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
L664857	u9000	m613	XANDER	How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
L664849	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	"What's with that ""X"" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're ""extreme""? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head."
L664848	u9000	m613	XANDER	Not bad for a gimp.
L664847	u9000	m613	XANDER	You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
L664846	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
L664845	u9000	m613	XANDER	What do I get out of it?
L664844	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
L664843	u9000	m613	XANDER	Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
L664839	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
L664838	u9000	m613	XANDER	I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
L664837	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
L664836	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
L664835	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
L664834	u9000	m613	XANDER	You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
L664833	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
L664832	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
L664831	u9000	m613	XANDER	You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
L664830	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
L664772	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
L664771	u9000	m613	XANDER	You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
L664770	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
L664769	u9000	m613	XANDER	Is that a fact?
L664768	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
L664767	u9000	m613	XANDER	Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
L664766	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
L664765	u9000	m613	XANDER	Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
L664764	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Why is that?
L664763	u9000	m613	XANDER	..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
L664762	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	"Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. ""Many are called, few are chosen"", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?"
L664761	u9000	m613	XANDER	A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
L664760	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
L664759	u9000	m613	XANDER	Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
L664758	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
L664757	u9000	m613	XANDER	That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
L664756	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
L664753	u9000	m613	XANDER	"Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a ""salesman"" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a ""trucker"", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I ""walked"" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?"
L664752	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	Looks like a diner.
L664751	u9000	m613	XANDER	What is this place?
L664750	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
L664749	u9000	m613	XANDER	Who the hell are you?
L664964	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
L664963	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
L664962	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
L664961	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
L664960	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
L664959	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
L664958	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	You what? A wire transfer of this size?
L664957	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	I think we should send him whatever he wants.
L664956	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
L664695	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	That's exactly why we need them.
L664694	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
L664693	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	I've seen enough. Turn it off.
L664692	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	But programmable. And expendable.
L664691	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	The scum of the Earth.
L664690	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
L664689	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
L664688	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
L664687	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
L664686	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	How will you fix it?
L664685	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
L664684	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
L664683	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
L664682	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
L664681	u8991	m613	GIBBONS	"Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called ""Ahab"". Whatever it is, it cost him his life."
L664680	u8995	m613	SAM TANNICK	What do you have?
L664809	u8992	m613	JEFE	Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
L664808	u9000	m613	XANDER	Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
L664807	u8992	m613	JEFE	You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
L664806	u9000	m613	XANDER	We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
L664800	u9000	m613	XANDER	We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
L664799	u8992	m613	JEFE	We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
L664798	u8992	m613	JEFE	That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
L664797	u9000	m613	XANDER	Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
L664796	u8992	m613	JEFE	Whatchu doing here?
L664891	u8993	m613	KID	He gets to be the hero.
L664890	u9000	m613	XANDER	Like what?
L664889	u8993	m613	KID	Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
L664888	u9000	m613	XANDER	Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
L664887	u8993	m613	KID	What do you get if you finish?
L664886	u9000	m613	XANDER	Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
L664885	u8993	m613	KID	What weapons do you have?
L664884	u9000	m613	XANDER	What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
L664883	u8993	m613	KID	"Anarchy 99""?"
L664882	u9000	m613	XANDER	"Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it ""blood week"". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99."
L664879	u9000	m613	XANDER	"Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the ""Finger of God"". Assassination and weapons."
L664878	u8993	m613	KID	This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
L664877	u8993	m613	KID	Naturally.
L664876	u9000	m613	XANDER	Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
L664874	u9000	m613	XANDER	You wanna check it out? Come here.
L664873	u8993	m613	KID	Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
L664872	u9000	m613	XANDER	"Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called ""Anarchy 99"", they're the bad guy bosses."
L664871	u8993	m613	KID	What game is that?
L665336	u9000	m613	XANDER	It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
L665335	u8994	m613	PETRA	What are you doing?
L665334	u9000	m613	XANDER	You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
L665333	u8994	m613	PETRA	I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
L665314	u9000	m613	XANDER	Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
L665313	u8994	m613	PETRA	By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
L665312	u9000	m613	XANDER	It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
L665311	u8994	m613	PETRA	It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
L665309	u9000	m613	XANDER	A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
L665308	u8994	m613	PETRA	No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
L665307	u9000	m613	XANDER	You can't talk to it?
L665306	u8994	m613	PETRA	He's shut out the communication circuit!
L665303	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
L665302	u8994	m613	PETRA	A piece of shrapnel hit me.
L665301	u9000	m613	XANDER	You okay?
L665298	u8994	m613	PETRA	Let me.
L665297	u9000	m613	XANDER	Toadies right behind.
L665296	u8994	m613	PETRA	Go to the water, it's that way!
L665295	u9000	m613	XANDER	Where'd the damn truck go?!
L665289	u8994	m613	PETRA	He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
L665288	u9000	m613	XANDER	Where's he headed?
L665287	u9000	m613	XANDER	Let's do this.
L665286	u8994	m613	PETRA	If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
L665285	u9000	m613	XANDER	Did you do your homework?
L665282	u9000	m613	XANDER	Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
L665281	u8994	m613	PETRA	Yorgi and Kirill.
L665270	u9000	m613	XANDER	He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
L665269	u8994	m613	PETRA	Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
L665230	u8994	m613	PETRA	What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
L665229	u9000	m613	XANDER	When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
L665228	u8994	m613	PETRA	I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
L665227	u9000	m613	XANDER	Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
L665226	u8994	m613	PETRA	Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
L665225	u9000	m613	XANDER	You don't have to do that.
L665224	u8994	m613	PETRA	I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
L665223	u9000	m613	XANDER	A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
L665222	u8994	m613	PETRA	Aren't you afraid?
L665221	u9000	m613	XANDER	We'll have to go after them.
L665220	u8994	m613	PETRA	They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
L665218	u8994	m613	PETRA	Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
L665217	u9000	m613	XANDER	We can't leave now. We have to do something.
L665216	u8994	m613	PETRA	No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
L665215	u9000	m613	XANDER	Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
L665214	u8994	m613	PETRA	What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
L665213	u9000	m613	XANDER	Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
L665212	u8994	m613	PETRA	It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
L665211	u9000	m613	XANDER	Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
L665210	u8994	m613	PETRA	We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
L665209	u9000	m613	XANDER	Where are we going?
L665208	u8994	m613	PETRA	I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
L665207	u9000	m613	XANDER	What are you doing with the Ivans?
L665206	u9000	m613	XANDER	I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
L665205	u8994	m613	PETRA	I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
L665204	u9000	m613	XANDER	What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
L665203	u8994	m613	PETRA	Are you alright?
L665179	u8994	m613	PETRA	You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
L665178	u9000	m613	XANDER	When can I see you again?
L665177	u8994	m613	PETRA	Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
L665176	u9000	m613	XANDER	Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
L665175	u8994	m613	PETRA	No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
L665174	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
L665173	u8994	m613	PETRA	I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
L665172	u9000	m613	XANDER	You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
L665171	u8994	m613	PETRA	I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
L665170	u9000	m613	XANDER	What's that?
L665169	u8994	m613	PETRA	There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
L665168	u9000	m613	XANDER	We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
L665167	u8994	m613	PETRA	No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
L665166	u9000	m613	XANDER	So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
L665132	u9000	m613	XANDER	They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
L665131	u8994	m613	PETRA	I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
L665129	u9000	m613	XANDER	Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
L665128	u8994	m613	PETRA	That's alright, I'll figure something out.
L665127	u9000	m613	XANDER	If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
L665126	u8994	m613	PETRA	Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
L665125	u9000	m613	XANDER	It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
L665124	u8994	m613	PETRA	There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
L665123	u9000	m613	XANDER	What are you talking about?
L665122	u8994	m613	PETRA	They tell me you're an American agent.
L665116	u9000	m613	XANDER	So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
L665115	u8994	m613	PETRA	A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
L665114	u9000	m613	XANDER	We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
L665113	u8994	m613	PETRA	All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
L665112	u9000	m613	XANDER	The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
L665111	u8994	m613	PETRA	Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
L665110	u9000	m613	XANDER	I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
L665109	u8994	m613	PETRA	You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
L665108	u9000	m613	XANDER	Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
L665107	u8994	m613	PETRA	Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
L665106	u9000	m613	XANDER	Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
L665105	u8994	m613	PETRA	So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
L665104	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm from L.A.
L665103	u8994	m613	PETRA	That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
L665098	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
L665097	u8994	m613	PETRA	What are you?
L665095	u9000	m613	XANDER	Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
L665094	u8994	m613	PETRA	Go to hell!
L665093	u9000	m613	XANDER	The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
L665092	u8994	m613	PETRA	I don't know what you're talking about.
L665084	u9000	m613	XANDER	That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
L665083	u8994	m613	PETRA	Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
L665082	u9000	m613	XANDER	Hey, you're good.
L665081	u9000	m613	XANDER	You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
L665080	u8994	m613	PETRA	Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
L665079	u9000	m613	XANDER	Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
L665078	u8994	m613	PETRA	I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
L665077	u9000	m613	XANDER	We hung out last night, remember?
L665076	u8994	m613	PETRA	Who are you?
L665049	u9000	m613	XANDER	That right? Why's that?
L665048	u8994	m613	PETRA	Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
L665047	u9000	m613	XANDER	Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
L665046	u8994	m613	PETRA	I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
L665045	u9000	m613	XANDER	I was invited. What's your story?
L665044	u8994	m613	PETRA	Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
L665043	u9000	m613	XANDER	Where are you going?
L665042	u9000	m613	XANDER	Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
L665041	u8994	m613	PETRA	Mind your business.
L665040	u9000	m613	XANDER	It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
L665039	u8994	m613	PETRA	Go to hell.
L665038	u9000	m613	XANDER	You do everything Yorgi says?
L665037	u8994	m613	PETRA	Yorgi asked me to.
L665036	u9000	m613	XANDER	If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
L664938	u8994	m613	PETRA	So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
L664937	u9000	m613	XANDER	Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
L664936	u8994	m613	PETRA	My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
L664935	u9000	m613	XANDER	Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
L664934	u8994	m613	PETRA	Do you know what a wire transfer is?
L664933	u9000	m613	XANDER	I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
L664932	u8994	m613	PETRA	Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
L665260	u9001	m613	YORGI	Nice place to start, don't you think?
L665259	u8994	m613	PETRA	The Peace conference...
L665148	u9001	m613	YORGI	Viktor! Stay the course.
L665147	u8994	m613	PETRA	Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
L665146	u9001	m613	YORGI	You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
L665145	u8994	m613	PETRA	I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
L665144	u9001	m613	YORGI	What was that for?
L665139	u9001	m613	YORGI	It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
L665138	u8994	m613	PETRA	What are you doing?
L664998	u9001	m613	YORGI	Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
L664997	u8994	m613	PETRA	Nothing. He had two days.
L664994	u9000	m613	XANDER	I thought that was in detail.
L664993	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
L664992	u9000	m613	XANDER	You're joking, right?
L664991	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
L664990	u9000	m613	XANDER	From the Beastie Boys collection?
L664989	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
L664988	u9000	m613	XANDER	I think I'll hang on to these.
L664984	u9000	m613	XANDER	That one I'm real familiar with.
L664983	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	This is your standard dart gun.
L664982	u9000	m613	XANDER	They come in any other styles or colors?
L664981	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
L664975	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
L664974	u9000	m613	XANDER	Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
L664973	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
L664972	u9000	m613	XANDER	I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
L664971	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
L664967	u9000	m613	XANDER	That's would be me.
L664966	u8996	m613	SHAVERS	Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
L664722	u8997	m613	SKY	You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
L664721	u9000	m613	XANDER	"You're not exactly ""going anywhere"" yourself."
L664720	u8997	m613	SKY	You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
L664719	u9000	m613	XANDER	I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
L664718	u8997	m613	SKY	This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
L664717	u9000	m613	XANDER	Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
L664716	u8997	m613	SKY	You're serious?
L664715	u9000	m613	XANDER	I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
L664714	u8997	m613	SKY	What...?
L664713	u9000	m613	XANDER	Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
L664712	u8997	m613	SKY	It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
L664711	u9000	m613	XANDER	Alright, so I'll get more.
L664710	u8997	m613	SKY	French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
L664708	u9000	m613	XANDER	I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
L664707	u8997	m613	SKY	"You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much ""integrity"" for that."
L664706	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm having fun, what's the problem?
L664705	u8997	m613	SKY	You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
L664704	u9000	m613	XANDER	I can see that. Why?
L664703	u8997	m613	SKY	I'm through, Xander.
L664702	u9000	m613	XANDER	Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
L665201	u8998	m613	SLOVO	They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
L665200	u9000	m613	XANDER	Why you dogging me up?
L665199	u8998	m613	SLOVO	Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
L665198	u9000	m613	XANDER	What's the deal?
L665197	u8998	m613	SLOVO	"Sorry, ""dude""."
L665195	u8998	m613	SLOVO	Is this what you're looking for?
L665194	u9000	m613	XANDER	I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
L665193	u8998	m613	SLOVO	You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
L665192	u9000	m613	XANDER	Dude, what are you doing here?
L664970	u9000	m613	XANDER	Yeah, thanks a lot.
L664969	u8998	m613	SLOVO	I'll leave you two alone to talk.
L664903	u8998	m613	SLOVO	The corner. Anarchy 99.
L664902	u9000	m613	XANDER	Nice hops.
L664900	u9000	m613	XANDER	First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
L664899	u8998	m613	SLOVO	You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
L664898	u9000	m613	XANDER	Here we go again.
L664897	u8998	m613	SLOVO	My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
L664896	u9000	m613	XANDER	I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
L664895	u8998	m613	SLOVO	Sit down.
L664824	u9000	m613	XANDER	Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
L664823	u8999	m613	VIRG	They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
L664818	u8999	m613	VIRG	It's like you said, every man for himself.
L664817	u9000	m613	XANDER	Help me with this guy.
L664803	u8999	m613	VIRG	He's a pretty good actor, though.
L664802	u9000	m613	XANDER	Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
L664780	u9000	m613	XANDER	A parachute. This does not argue well.
L664779	u8999	m613	VIRG	Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
L664775	u9000	m613	XANDER	Been to any good diners lately?
L664774	u8999	m613	VIRG	What's so damn funny?
L665272	u9000	m613	XANDER	Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
L665271	u9001	m613	YORGI	You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
L665268	u9001	m613	YORGI	Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
L665267	u9000	m613	XANDER	"And here I thought ""anarchy"" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt."
L665266	u9001	m613	YORGI	Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
L665265	u9000	m613	XANDER	Including rape, pillage, murder.
L665264	u9001	m613	YORGI	Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
L665263	u9000	m613	XANDER	So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
L665262	u9001	m613	YORGI	You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
L665261	u9000	m613	XANDER	What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
L665258	u9001	m613	YORGI	Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
L665257	u9000	m613	XANDER	I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
L665256	u9001	m613	YORGI	And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
L665250	u9000	m613	XANDER	Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
L665249	u9001	m613	YORGI	That was for Anders.
L665067	u9001	m613	YORGI	You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
L665066	u9000	m613	XANDER	That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
L665065	u9001	m613	YORGI	I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
L665059	u9000	m613	XANDER	My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
L665058	u9001	m613	YORGI	Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
L665057	u9000	m613	XANDER	Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
L665056	u9001	m613	YORGI	You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
L665055	u9000	m613	XANDER	I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
L665054	u9001	m613	YORGI	It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
L665053	u9000	m613	XANDER	You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
L665033	u9001	m613	YORGI	Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
L665032	u9000	m613	XANDER	How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
L665031	u9001	m613	YORGI	You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
L665030	u9000	m613	XANDER	...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese. 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
L665029	u9001	m613	YORGI	"To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: ""America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."""
L665028	u9001	m613	YORGI	That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
L665027	u9000	m613	XANDER	Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
L665026	u9000	m613	XANDER	You wanna see my politics?
L665025	u9001	m613	YORGI	It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
L665024	u9000	m613	XANDER	"What's ""Anarchy 99""?"
L665023	u9001	m613	YORGI	Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
L665020	u9000	m613	XANDER	Had to do what I had to do.
L665019	u9001	m613	YORGI	I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
L665014	u9000	m613	XANDER	Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
L665013	u9001	m613	YORGI	He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
L665012	u9000	m613	XANDER	You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
L665011	u9001	m613	YORGI	What's going on, my friend?
L665004	u9001	m613	YORGI	This is a gift. From me to you.
L665003	u9000	m613	XANDER	What's this?
L665002	u9001	m613	YORGI	Of course.
L665001	u9000	m613	XANDER	I had to inspect the merchandise first.
L665000	u9001	m613	YORGI	I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
L664999	u9000	m613	XANDER	Very nice. I'm impressed.
L664940	u9000	m613	XANDER	It'll work faster if I have an account number.
L664939	u9001	m613	YORGI	Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
L664930	u9000	m613	XANDER	Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
L664929	u9001	m613	YORGI	We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
L664926	u9000	m613	XANDER	When else are you gonna do it?
L664925	u9001	m613	YORGI	I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
L664919	u9000	m613	XANDER	I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
L664918	u9001	m613	YORGI	Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
L664917	u9000	m613	XANDER	Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
L664916	u9001	m613	YORGI	I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
L664915	u9000	m613	XANDER	He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
L664914	u9001	m613	YORGI	Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
L664910	u9000	m613	XANDER	Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
L664909	u9001	m613	YORGI	This pizda? Never seen him before.
L664908	u9000	m613	XANDER	That's the guy.
L666463	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
L666462	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	Why don 't the Zulus attack?
L666368	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
L666367	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
L666366	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
L666365	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
L666364	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
L666363	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
L666362	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	"I listened extra careful to your ""Stand To"" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?"
L666361	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	"Will you hear ""Last Post"", Sir?"
L666505	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
L666504	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
L666503	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
L666398	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
L666397	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
L666396	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
L666395	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	"If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but ""why?"" is the question my readers will ask. ""why?"""
L666394	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
L666393	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
L666392	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
L666391	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
L666390	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
L666389	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	"Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of ""The Standard"", My Lord."
L666388	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	An historical moment, Gentlemen.
L666488	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
L666487	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
L666484	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I'm explaining my reasons.
L666483	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
L666482	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
L666481	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
L666480	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
L666358	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
L666357	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
L666250	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
L666249	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
L666248	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
L666247	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
L666246	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
L666547	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	Certainly, Sin
L666546	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
L666486	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
L666485	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Yes?
L666461	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Thank you.
L666460	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
L666385	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
L666384	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	"Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from ""The Standard""."
L666383	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
L666252	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	But will they make good use of them?
L666251	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
L666502	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
L666501	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
L666500	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
L666499	u9028	m616	COGHILL	How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
L666498	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Yes.
L666497	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Stuart?
L666576	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
L666575	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
L666327	u9031	m616	MELVILL	ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
L666326	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
L666325	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Which one?
L666324	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
L666264	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
L666263	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
L666262	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
L666522	u9034	m616	VEREKER	So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there. 
L666521	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
L666520	u9034	m616	VEREKER	Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
L666372	u9034	m616	VEREKER	I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
L666371	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
L666370	u9034	m616	VEREKER	I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
L666369	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Your orders, Mr Vereker?
L666257	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
L666256	u9034	m616	VEREKER	Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
