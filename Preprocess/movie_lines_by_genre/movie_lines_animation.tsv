L239796	u1136	m75	BRIDE	What's the matter, dear?
L239795	u1141	m75	GROOM	Uuuuuuugh!!
L239794	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
L239792	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Have I done the right thing?
L239791	u1141	m75	GROOM	To the bathroom, where do you think?
L239790	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Now where are you going?
L239789	u1136	m75	BRIDE	I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
L239788	u1141	m75	GROOM	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
L239787	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Roy?  Your clock broke.
L239785	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Well, thanks a lot.
L239784	u1141	m75	GROOM	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
L239783	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Aren't you glad we waited?
L239577	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I was just going to say ""eight.""  You're fantastic!"
L239576	u1137	m75	COED	Eight o'clock?
L239575	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
L239569	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
L239568	u1137	m75	COED	Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
L239567	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
L239554	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
L239553	u1137	m75	COED	No.  They're just coming to me.
L239552	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
L239551	u1137	m75	COED	Ummm -- figure eight?
L239550	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ready?  What is it?
L239546	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
L239545	u1137	m75	COED	Is it a star?
L240310	u1138	m75	DANA	All right, what happened to me?
L240309	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
L240308	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
L240220	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.
L240219	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Are you the Gatekeeper?
L240015	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I got the Twister game for later ...
L240014	u1138	m75	DANA	Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
L240013	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
L240012	u1138	m75	DANA	Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
L240011	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
L240010	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L240009	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you.
L239676	u1138	m75	DANA	I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
L239675	u1144	m75	LOUIS	You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
L239674	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
L239673	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
L239672	u1138	m75	DANA	No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
L239671	u1144	m75	LOUIS	"Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped ""20 Minute Workout"" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?"
L239670	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you sick, Louis?
L239669	u1144	m75	LOUIS	... I thought it was the drug store.
L239668	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L239667	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you ...
L240316	u1138	m75	DANA	Talk to my accountant. 
L240315	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
L240314	u1138	m75	DANA	Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
L240313	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
L240312	u1138	m75	DANA	Really!  Is it gone?
L240311	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
L240064	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Whoa!! Nice voice.
L240063	u1138	m75	DANA	There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
L240062	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
L240061	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am ...
L240060	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
L240059	u1138	m75	DANA	I want you inside me.
L240058	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
L240056	u1138	m75	DANA	Take me now.
L240055	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
L240054	u1138	m75	DANA	Do you want this body?
L240053	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
L240052	u1138	m75	DANA	He is the Destructor.
L240051	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
L240050	u1138	m75	DANA	We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
L240048	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
L240047	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
L239944	u1138	m75	DANA	I've got to go now.
L239943	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
L239942	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  Since you put it that way.
L239941	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
L239940	u1138	m75	DANA	I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
L239939	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
L239938	u1138	m75	DANA	What's he doing in my refrigerator.
L239937	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
L239936	u1138	m75	DANA	"Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  ""Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."""
L239935	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
L239934	u1138	m75	DANA	You must have gotten the last copy.
L239933	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name ""Zuul"" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it."
L239932	u1138	m75	DANA	Can't you tell me now?
L239931	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
L239930	u1138	m75	DANA	He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
L239929	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Is he dying or something?
L239928	u1138	m75	DANA	"The ""stiff?""  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man."
L239927	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who's the stiff?
L239926	u1138	m75	DANA	I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
L239925	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
L239924	u1138	m75	DANA	Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
L239923	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're the best one in your row.
L239922	u1138	m75	DANA	You heard it?
L239921	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great rehearsal.
L239776	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No kiss?
L239775	u1138	m75	DANA	Goodbye.
L239774	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Then I'll go.
L239773	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.
L239772	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
L239771	u1138	m75	DANA	Then leave.
L239770	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Don't scream.
L239769	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll scream.
L239768	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I want to help you.
L239767	u1138	m75	DANA	Out!
L239766	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On a purely scientific basis.
L239765	u1138	m75	DANA	That's it.  Get out.
L239764	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I think I should spend the night here.
L239763	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  What do you want to do?
L239762	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
L239761	u1138	m75	DANA	Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
L239760	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
L239759	u1138	m75	DANA	This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
L239758	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
L239757	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.
L239756	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you all right?
L239755	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Damn!
L239753	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I know.  It happened by itself.
L239752	u1138	m75	DANA	I told you, I ...
L239751	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're quite a housekeeper.
L239750	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll wait here if you don't mind.
L239749	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, let's check it out.
L239748	u1138	m75	DANA	Uh-huh.
L239747	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
L239746	u1138	m75	DANA	What?
L239745	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	That's too bad.
L239743	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Thanks.  What's in there?
L239742	u1138	m75	DANA	Like a used car salesman.
L239741	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No?  What do I act like?
L239740	u1138	m75	DANA	You really don't act like a scientist.
L239739	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
L239738	u1138	m75	DANA	That's a violin concerto.
L239737	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
L239736	u1138	m75	DANA	Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
L239735	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
L239734	u1138	m75	DANA	No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
L239733	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
L239732	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"Spengler,  see if you can find the word ""Zuul"" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment."
L239731	u1138	m75	DANA	No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
L239728	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's in the stars.
L239727	u1138	m75	DANA	Is that your professional opinion?
L239720	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
L239719	u1138	m75	DANA	Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
L239715	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So what do you think it was?
L239714	u1138	m75	DANA	... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
L239711	u1138	m75	DANA	Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
L239710	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We're all professionals here, Miss ...
L239709	u1138	m75	DANA	Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
L239708	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
L239640	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I see.
L239639	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	"Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of ""dodge"" or ""hustle.""  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University."
L239638	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But why?  The students love us!
L239637	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
L239636	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
L239635	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
L239634	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
L240323	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	That would definitely explain it.
L240322	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
L240321	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
L240320	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
L240319	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
L240032	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
L240031	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
L240030	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	That is one speedy mutt.
L239621	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We'll get back to you.
L239620	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Did you see it?  What was it?
L239602	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
L239601	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	What's that got to do with it?
L239593	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
L239592	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
L239591	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
L239590	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
L240232	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Thank you.
L240231	u1143	m75	JANINE	Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
L240230	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't believe in luck.
L240229	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
L240228	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240227	u1143	m75	JANINE	I want you to have this. 
L240118	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's so romantic.
L240117	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
L240116	u1143	m75	JANINE	In the physical sense.
L240115	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Die in what sense?
L240114	u1143	m75	JANINE	Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
L239707	u1143	m75	JANINE	Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
L239706	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I think it's the food of the future.
L239705	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, that's very - unusual.
L239704	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I collect spores, molds and fungus.
L239703	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
L239702	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Is that a game?
L239701	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
L239700	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Print is dead.
L239699	u1143	m75	JANINE	You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
L239966	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
L239965	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
L239964	u1143	m75	JANINE	I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
L239963	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The EPA?  What's he want?
L239962	u1143	m75	JANINE	And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
L239958	u1143	m75	JANINE	Here are tonight's calls.
L239957	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
L239713	u1143	m75	JANINE	What calls?
L239712	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
L239805	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
L239804	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
L239803	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Did you ever report it to anyone?
L239802	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
L239801	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Has this ever happened before?
L239800	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
L240208	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
L240207	u1146	m75	PECK	"That's ""Peck!"""
L240206	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
L240197	u1146	m75	PECK	Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
L240196	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
L240157	u1146	m75	PECK	See!  They are using drugs.
L240156	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
L240132	u1146	m75	PECK	Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
L240131	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
L239995	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
L239994	u1146	m75	PECK	Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
L239993	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
L239992	u1146	m75	PECK	Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
L239991	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why do you want to see it?
L239990	u1146	m75	PECK	May I please see the storage facility?
L239989	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"The magic word is ""please."""
L239988	u1146	m75	PECK	And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
L239987	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Because you didn't say the magic word.
L239986	u1146	m75	PECK	And why not, Mr. Venkman?
L239985	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No, you may not.
L239984	u1146	m75	PECK	And may I see this storage facility?
L239983	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, it would.
L239982	u1146	m75	PECK	And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
L239981	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	In a storage facility.
L239980	u1146	m75	PECK	And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
L239979	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm not at liberty to say.
L239978	u1146	m75	PECK	And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
L239977	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You could say that.
L239976	u1146	m75	PECK	I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
L239975	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
L239974	u1146	m75	PECK	Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
L239973	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
L239972	u1146	m75	PECK	Are you Peter Venkman?
L239971	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  How's it going?
L239970	u1146	m75	PECK	I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
L239969	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Can I help you?
L239565	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Then my theory was correct.
L239564	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
L239563	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
L239562	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
L239561	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
L239560	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
L239559	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sorry.  This isn't your day.
L239558	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Two wavy lines?
L239557	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
L239556	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yes.  I don't like this.
L239555	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nervous?
L239549	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Close -- but definitely wrong.
L239548	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Circle?
L239543	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good guess -- but no.
L239542	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	A square?
L239541	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	All right.  What is it?
L239902	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wow!
L239901	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
L239900	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
L239899	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
L239898	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
L239897	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
L239896	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
L239828	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
L239827	u1154	m75	WOMAN	You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
L239826	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
L239825	u1154	m75	WOMAN	What on earth gave you that idea?
L239824	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Were you recently in the bathroom?
L239823	u1154	m75	WOMAN	Yes?
L240302	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But it's my favorite state.
L240301	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Life is just a state of mind.
L240300	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
L240299	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
L240298	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
L240289	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Full-stream with strogon pulse.
L240288	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What now?
L240184	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
L240183	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	You talked to Gozer?
L240182	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer.
L240181	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Who?
L240180	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"She said he was ""the Destructor."""
L240179	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
L240178	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
L240177	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
L240153	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, shit!
L240152	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Where's the Keymaster?
L240134	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
L240133	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	He wants to shut down the storage grid.
L240113	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right, Peter.  Good night.
L240112	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
L240111	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right.  I'll try.
L240110	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
L240109	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I agree.
L240108	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
L240107	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
L240106	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
L240105	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Does she want to be?
L240104	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
L240103	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240102	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
L239858	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
L239857	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"What do you mean ""bad?"""
L239856	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Trust me.  It will be bad.
L239855	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why not?
L239854	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Don't cross the beams.
L239853	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?
L239852	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
L239819	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, I can smell it.
L239818	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Something was definitely here.
L239780	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
L239779	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Did you see anything?
L239718	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
L239717	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
L239656	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
L239655	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
L239629	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Wow!
L239628	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm always serious.
L239627	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
L239589	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
L239588	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
L239587	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What have you got, Egon?
L239586	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh!  You're here.
L240272	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	That appears to be the case.
L240271	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
L240170	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
L240169	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
L240151	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
L240150	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What happened??!!!?
L240000	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
L239999	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239998	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I've got to sleep.
L239997	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Neutronize.  System shut.
L239996	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Set entry grid.
L239869	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
L239868	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's working!
L239832	u1150	m75	STANTZ	God, it's ugly!
L239831	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
L239817	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	We'd better adjust our streams.
L239816	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sorry, Buddy!
L239811	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I blame myself.
L239810	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
L239722	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
L239721	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
L240287	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
L240286	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
L240285	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
L240280	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look!
L240279	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?  What popped in there?
L240278	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
L240262	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
L240261	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Agile bastard, isn't he?
L240255	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, that ought to do it.
L240254	u1150	m75	STANTZ	As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
L240252	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't think it's Shandor.
L240251	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
L240176	u1150	m75	STANTZ	He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
L240175	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who was the architect?
L240174	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
L240173	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
L240006	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's not good, Pete.
L240005	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239956	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
L239955	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy, that was a rough one.
L239845	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
L239844	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	How do you know?
L239843	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
L239842	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
L239841	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
L239840	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
L239839	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Third floor.  Get down here,
L239838	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Where are you, Pete?
L239837	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray -- Something's here.
L239822	u1150	m75	STANTZ	All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
L239821	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
L239820	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
L239814	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
L239813	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No sense worrying about it now.
L239812	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So do I.
L239782	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
L239781	u1150	m75	STANTZ	They will.
L239778	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
L239777	u1150	m75	STANTZ	How was your date?
L239730	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
L239729	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
L239697	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Fourteen hundred.
L239696	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
L239695	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
L239663	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of ""pricey"" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company."
L239662	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Wow!  Does this pole still work?
L239658	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
L239657	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But most people are afraid to even report these things.
L239654	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
L239653	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
L239652	u1150	m75	STANTZ	My parents left me that house, I was born there.
L239651	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You'll never regret this, Ray.
L239649	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	To go into business for ourselves.
L239648	u1150	m75	STANTZ	For what purpose?
L239647	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
L239646	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
L239645	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
L239644	u1150	m75	STANTZ	This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
L239642	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
L239641	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
L239633	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
L239632	u1150	m75	STANTZ	If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
L239631	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
L239624	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
L239623	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
L239622	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get her?  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
L239615	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
L239614	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
L239613	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Anything!  Just make contact.
L239612	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do I say?
L239611	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  Talk to it.
L239610	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do we do now?
L239609	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I told you it's real.
L239607	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
L239606	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What is it?
L239583	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
L239582	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
L239581	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Looked at with your eyes.
L239580	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean by ""seen?"""
L239579	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
L239578	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
L239574	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
L239573	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
L239572	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
L239571	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
L240268	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean ""choose?""  We don't understand."
L240267	u1153	m75	WINSTON	What's he talking about?  Choose what?
L240121	u1150	m75	STANTZ	LATER, MAN!!
L240120	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Stantz?  You okay in there?
L240088	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  We'll believe anything.
L240087	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
L240083	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
L240082	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
L240081	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, Judgement Day.
L240080	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Judgement Day ...
L240079	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  And the sky would fall ...
L240078	u1150	m75	STANTZ	And the seas would boil ...
L240077	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
L240076	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
L240075	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
L240074	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
L240073	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Do you believe in God?
L240072	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
L240071	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too.
L240070	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Mmmhmmm.
L240069	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Are you a Christian, Ray?
L240068	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
L240067	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
L239968	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
L239967	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
L350818	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Absolutely not.
L350817	u1846	m121	NICKY	Now will you get in the flask?
L350806	u1846	m121	NICKY	No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
L350805	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Is this a joke?
L350804	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
L350803	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Little Nicky.
L350740	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
L350739	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
L350657	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I hear a train coming. Drink.
L350656	u1846	m121	NICKY	Let her go.
L350655	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
L350383	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
L350382	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
L350381	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
L350380	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
L350379	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	He's sick?
L350378	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
L350375	u1846	m121	NICKY	Please, get out of my mind!
L350374	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	You shouldn't have come here.
L350373	u1846	m121	NICKY	ADRIAN!
L350864	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Don't do it!
L350863	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	No!
L350825	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
L350824	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
L350650	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You mother...
L350649	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
L350648	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	All right. Let me out.
L350647	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Hello, Cassius.
L350249	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
L350248	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
L350247	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I lowered the drinking age to ten.
L350246	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
L350245	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Let the sin begins -- that was a good one.
L350127	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	It's our time, brother.
L350126	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	...their damned souls will be ours.
L350125	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
L350124	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
L350123	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	We could create our own hell there.
L350122	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	What do you think about... Earth?
L350121	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
L350120	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Could you concentrate for five seconds?
L350119	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	That's what I thought!
L350116	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
L350115	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
L350114	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	It's just such a slap in the face.
L350113	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	And he's dead serious.
L350112	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
L350067	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
L350066	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I knew it. He's finally retiring.
L350802	u1843	m121	JOHN	You want a queen? Got one right here.
L350801	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
L350645	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I'm calling you out, brother...
L350644	u1843	m121	JOHN	Urr... uggg... errr...
L350643	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
L350642	u1843	m121	JOHN	Uh. No it won't?
L350641	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
L350640	u1843	m121	JOHN	And give you a good buzz.
L350637	u1843	m121	JOHN	Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
L350636	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
L350624	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Sure, why not?
L350623	u1843	m121	JOHN	But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
L350619	u1843	m121	JOHN	Noon...
L350618	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
L350763	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
L350762	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	She goes to Parson's, right?
L350737	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	Show him Central Park.
L350736	u1835	m121	ANGEL	All these good people have totally been led astray.
L350731	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
L350730	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I'll call her later.
L350723	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
L350722	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
L350665	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	So excited.
L350664	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
L350785	u1835	m121	ANGEL	You're already there...
L350784	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
L350783	u1835	m121	ANGEL	It would be so okay.
L350782	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
L350776	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
L350775	u1846	m121	NICKY	What is it?
L350773	u1846	m121	NICKY	A speech impediment?
L350772	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
L350771	u1846	m121	NICKY	But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
L350765	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Yeah, you do...
L350764	u1846	m121	NICKY	I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
L350761	u1835	m121	ANGEL	She's so nice.
L350760	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie's crying!
L350735	u1835	m121	ANGEL	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
L350734	u1846	m121	NICKY	How did you see me?
L350729	u1846	m121	NICKY	"Well tell her I said ""hi"" back."
L350728	u1835	m121	ANGEL	"Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says ""hi."""
L350721	u1835	m121	ANGEL	It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
L350720	u1846	m121	NICKY	Where did you meet my father?
L350685	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Angels don't get any older, son.
L350684	u1846	m121	NICKY	How come you're not older?
L350680	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
L350679	u1846	m121	NICKY	Wow. What... what did she look like?
L350678	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
L350677	u1846	m121	NICKY	An angel?
L350676	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Try an angel.
L350675	u1846	m121	NICKY	My mom wasn't a goat?
L350674	u1835	m121	ANGEL	A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
L350673	u1846	m121	NICKY	My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
L350672	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
L350671	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Maybe try the opposite of that.
L350670	u1846	m121	NICKY	The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
L350800	u1836	m121	BEEFY	That turn you on there, RuPaul?
L350799	u1851	m121	TODD	Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
L350759	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I can't screw.  I can't screw.
L350758	u1851	m121	TODD	They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
L350612	u1836	m121	BEEFY	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
L350611	u1851	m121	TODD	Where is he? He's late.
L350432	u1836	m121	BEEFY	No.
L350431	u1851	m121	TODD	Did you just talk?
L350430	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
L350429	u1851	m121	TODD	What's Nicky doing down there?
L350567	u1836	m121	BEEFY	"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
L350566	u1846	m121	NICKY	This is baloney!
L350562	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I think you're looking at him.
L350561	u1846	m121	NICKY	I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
L350560	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
L350559	u1846	m121	NICKY	I didn't murder anybody
L350556	u1836	m121	BEEFY	The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
L350555	u1846	m121	NICKY	I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
L350486	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
L350485	u1846	m121	NICKY	We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
L350407	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
L350406	u1846	m121	NICKY	Release the evil?
L350405	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
L350404	u1836	m121	BEEFY	But those are my roommate's sodas... Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
L350403	u1846	m121	NICKY	But those are my roommate's sodas...
L350402	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Go get a soda out of the fridge.
L350401	u1846	m121	NICKY	Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
L350400	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
L350399	u1846	m121	NICKY	What can I do about it?
L350398	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
L350264	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
L350263	u1846	m121	NICKY	All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
L350254	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, let's rock and roll.
L350253	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
L350252	u1846	m121	NICKY	Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
L350251	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
L350250	u1846	m121	NICKY	This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
L350233	u1846	m121	NICKY	Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
L350232	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
L350217	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
L350216	u1846	m121	NICKY	From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
L350209	u1846	m121	NICKY	I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
L350208	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
L350207	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
L350204	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Put it in your mouth.
L350203	u1846	m121	NICKY	So far, so good. Now what?
L350202	u1836	m121	BEEFY	That pain is hunger.
L350201	u1846	m121	NICKY	I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
L350200	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
L350199	u1846	m121	NICKY	It's freezing up here, Beefy.
L350198	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Makin' friends already.
L350194	u1846	m121	NICKY	Oh. Sorry.
L350193	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It's not me, moron.
L350192	u1846	m121	NICKY	"Okay, ""bro,"" this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there."
L350191	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
L350190	u1846	m121	NICKY	I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
L350189	u1836	m121	BEEFY	My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
L350161	u1839	m121	DAD	Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
L350160	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
L350159	u1839	m121	DAD	Please, pop, just go back to your room.
L350158	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
L350157	u1839	m121	DAD	Everything's fine, pop.
L350156	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
L350144	u1839	m121	DAD	Now you're talking.
L350143	u1840	m121	DAN	This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
L350142	u1839	m121	DAD	Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
L350141	u1840	m121	DAN	You did it for Namath.
L350140	u1839	m121	DAD	In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
L350139	u1840	m121	DAN	C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
L350138	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
L350596	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
L350595	u1839	m121	DAD	Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
L350594	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Check one-two. Check one-two.
L350591	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
L350590	u1839	m121	DAD	I got no ears! I can't hear!
L350099	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
L350098	u1839	m121	DAD	No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
L350097	u1839	m121	DAD	Yes, Jimmy.
L350096	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Knock, knock.
L350859	u1846	m121	NICKY	I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
L350858	u1839	m121	DAD	Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
L350854	u1839	m121	DAD	Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
L350853	u1846	m121	NICKY	What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
L350852	u1839	m121	DAD	You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
L350851	u1846	m121	NICKY	I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
L350850	u1839	m121	DAD	You came through, Nicky.
L350593	u1839	m121	DAD	I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
L350592	u1846	m121	NICKY	Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
L350589	u1839	m121	DAD	What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
L350588	u1846	m121	NICKY	Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
L350186	u1839	m121	DAD	Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
L350185	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
L350184	u1839	m121	DAD	That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
L350180	u1839	m121	DAD	Son, just do your best.
L350179	u1846	m121	NICKY	No. This can't be happening.
L350175	u1846	m121	NICKY	Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
L350174	u1839	m121	DAD	Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
L350168	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
L350167	u1846	m121	NICKY	So go get 'em, Dad!
L350166	u1839	m121	DAD	To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
L350155	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
L350154	u1846	m121	NICKY	How bad?
L350153	u1839	m121	DAD	This is bad, Nicky.
L350146	u1839	m121	DAD	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
L350145	u1846	m121	NICKY	You're a good devil, Dad.
L350137	u1839	m121	DAD	I was just playing with you.
L350136	u1846	m121	NICKY	Metallica, Dad. Come on.
L350135	u1839	m121	DAD	Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
L350134	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
L350133	u1839	m121	DAD	I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
L350132	u1846	m121	NICKY	Definitely.
L350131	u1839	m121	DAD	"Now that was an experience. ""You are only coming through in waves."" That line blows my mind every time."
L350106	u1839	m121	DAD	The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
L350105	u1846	m121	NICKY	I mean... tough break.
L350102	u1839	m121	DAD	Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
L350101	u1846	m121	NICKY	Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
L350100	u1839	m121	DAD	This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
L350093	u1839	m121	DAD	Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
L350092	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
L350091	u1839	m121	DAD	Now everybody sit down.
L350088	u1839	m121	DAD	Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
L350087	u1846	m121	NICKY	Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
L350260	u1846	m121	NICKY	Beast.
L350259	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Bus?
L350215	u1846	m121	NICKY	You got it.
L350214	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350213	u1846	m121	NICKY	Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350212	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Thanks.
L350211	u1846	m121	NICKY	That's a pretty brassiere.
L350210	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Hey.
L350152	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	That's what I'm thinkin'...
L350151	u1846	m121	NICKY	Coulda been much worse.
L350150	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
L350355	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
L350354	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
L350353	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Boogerland!
L350352	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	What was it called, sir.
L350351	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
L350350	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	It's Stanley, sir.
L350349	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
L350347	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
L350346	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	I know, your wickedness.
L350345	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	You know, I was the one who created Hell.
L350183	u1846	m121	NICKY	I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
L350182	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
L350173	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
L350172	u1846	m121	NICKY	I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
L350171	u1846	m121	NICKY	You're not saying it's up to me?
L350170	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
L350169	u1846	m121	NICKY	So go get 'em, Jimmy!
L350165	u1846	m121	NICKY	We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
L350164	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
L350065	u1846	m121	NICKY	Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
L350064	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
L350063	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey...
L350795	u1843	m121	JOHN	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
L350794	u1851	m121	TODD	His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
L350484	u1851	m121	TODD	Oh, would you grow up.
L350483	u1843	m121	JOHN	Easy, Liberace.
L350478	u1851	m121	TODD	No.
L350477	u1843	m121	JOHN	By she, do you mean he?
L350476	u1851	m121	TODD	I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
L350464	u1851	m121	TODD	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
L350463	u1843	m121	JOHN	No wonder your uncle's so weird...
L350757	u1843	m121	JOHN	Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
L350756	u1847	m121	PETER	This don't look good.
L350631	u1847	m121	PETER	Peppermint... alright.
L350630	u1843	m121	JOHN	Schnapps...
L350600	u1847	m121	PETER	We know where to find Nicky.
L350599	u1843	m121	JOHN	Looking for the chief.
L350598	u1843	m121	JOHN	Little nervous. Wanna puke.
L350597	u1847	m121	PETER	You sure you're down with this?
L350490	u1847	m121	PETER	We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
L350489	u1843	m121	JOHN	That's a big pass, Elton John.
L350428	u1843	m121	JOHN	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
L350427	u1847	m121	PETER	Look who's back from the dead.
L350281	u1843	m121	JOHN	The Dark Prince is here.
L350280	u1847	m121	PETER	Did you check out the dragon mouth?
L350274	u1843	m121	JOHN	Yeah. You do it.
L350273	u1847	m121	PETER	Should we wake him up?
L350272	u1843	m121	JOHN	Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
L350271	u1847	m121	PETER	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
L350270	u1843	m121	JOHN	What's with that guy?
L350269	u1847	m121	PETER	Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
L350268	u1843	m121	JOHN	There's our man.
L350267	u1843	m121	JOHN	'Bout time...
L350266	u1847	m121	PETER	Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
L350493	u1846	m121	NICKY	See ya, fellas.
L350492	u1843	m121	JOHN	Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
L350491	u1846	m121	NICKY	No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
L350468	u1846	m121	NICKY	Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
L350467	u1843	m121	JOHN	Come on. One more time.
L350461	u1846	m121	NICKY	Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
L350460	u1843	m121	JOHN	What's Ozzy trying to say there?
L350278	u1843	m121	JOHN	That way.
L350277	u1846	m121	NICKY	Which way did he go?
L350397	u1848	m121	REGIS	I was DeNiro!
L350396	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	Yes, great movie...
L350395	u1848	m121	REGIS	Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
L350394	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	You keep a bat under your seat?
L350393	u1848	m121	REGIS	I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
L350392	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	You followed him?
L350391	u1848	m121	REGIS	So I followed him...
L350390	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
L350389	u1848	m121	REGIS	So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
L350842	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'll just go to Heaven.
L350841	u1847	m121	PETER	You gotta kill yourself.
L350580	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
L350579	u1847	m121	PETER	Dude. Seriously?
L350578	u1846	m121	NICKY	Good idea... kill me.
L350570	u1847	m121	PETER	Dude, it's us. Let us in.
L350569	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
L350470	u1846	m121	NICKY	All right...
L350469	u1847	m121	PETER	Please. You got to.
L350524	u1846	m121	NICKY	Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
L350523	u1850	m121	STUDENT	You got the wrong window again, man.
L350506	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Andrew.
L350505	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian?
L350504	u1850	m121	STUDENT	I don't need luck. I'm good.
L350503	u1846	m121	NICKY	Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
L350502	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
L350501	u1846	m121	NICKY	No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
L350500	u1850	m121	STUDENT	"It's ""Comptoir Sud Pacific."" Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?"
L350499	u1846	m121	NICKY	You smell like coconuts.
L350498	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Hello.
L350848	u1846	m121	NICKY	I love you.
L350847	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I love you.
L350846	u1846	m121	NICKY	Do me.
L350831	u1846	m121	NICKY	From my dad's side of the family.
L350830	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
L350828	u1846	m121	NICKY	That was Cassius!
L350827	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Nicky!
L350659	u1846	m121	NICKY	I have to, Valerie.
L350658	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Don't do it.
L350548	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head...
L350547	u1846	m121	NICKY	I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
L350546	u1846	m121	NICKY	East Rutherford.
L350545	u1852	m121	VALERIE	We're going to Jersey?
L350544	u1846	m121	NICKY	Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
L350543	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Can we go fly over Central Park?
L350537	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Okay, I do. Get back up here.
L350536	u1846	m121	NICKY	You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
L350533	u1846	m121	NICKY	...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
L350532	u1852	m121	VALERIE	"...""The Devil?""..."
L350531	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
L350530	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Yes...
L350529	u1846	m121	NICKY	Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
L350528	u1852	m121	VALERIE	"What do you mean, ""possessed?"""
L350527	u1846	m121	NICKY	That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
L350526	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
L350521	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
L350520	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
L350519	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Why would you be floating?
L350518	u1846	m121	NICKY	I think I'm floating.
L350517	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What are you doing?
L350516	u1846	m121	NICKY	No.
L350515	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Are you dead?
L350514	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie?
L350511	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
L350510	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What were you thinking coming here?
L350508	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
L350507	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey.
L350370	u1846	m121	NICKY	I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
L350369	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What was that?
L350368	u1846	m121	NICKY	Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
L350367	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What?
L350366	u1846	m121	NICKY	Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
L350365	u1852	m121	VALERIE	You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
L350364	u1846	m121	NICKY	Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
L350363	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Basically, yeah.
L350362	u1846	m121	NICKY	So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
L350343	u1846	m121	NICKY	Good. I was concerned.
L350342	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Sometimes, sure.
L350341	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
L350339	u1852	m121	VALERIE	My perfume?
L350338	u1846	m121	NICKY	What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
L350337	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
L350336	u1846	m121	NICKY	School?
L350335	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
L350332	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
L350331	u1852	m121	VALERIE	You have a dog? What kind?
L350330	u1846	m121	NICKY	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
L350329	u1852	m121	VALERIE	This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
L350327	u1852	m121	VALERIE	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
L350326	u1846	m121	NICKY	It's freezing my hands.
L350325	u1846	m121	NICKY	Uh, it's a deep south expression.
L350324	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Octopus people?
L350323	u1846	m121	NICKY	Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
L350322	u1852	m121	VALERIE	If you want to.
L350321	u1846	m121	NICKY	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
L350320	u1852	m121	VALERIE	That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
L350319	u1846	m121	NICKY	Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
L350318	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
L350317	u1846	m121	NICKY	If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
L350316	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
L350315	u1846	m121	NICKY	My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
L350314	u1852	m121	VALERIE	My dad's an optometrist.
L350313	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
L350312	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Why are you laughing?
L350311	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
L350310	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Really?
L350309	u1846	m121	NICKY	The South.
L350308	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
L350307	u1846	m121	NICKY	You think I'm a tourist?
L350306	u1852	m121	VALERIE	That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
L350305	u1846	m121	NICKY	That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
L350583	u1851	m121	TODD	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
L350582	u1846	m121	NICKY	That just hurt a lot.
L350482	u1851	m121	TODD	Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
L350481	u1846	m121	NICKY	A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
L350419	u1846	m121	NICKY	If it's Cassius, yes.
L350418	u1851	m121	TODD	A black guy?
L350417	u1846	m121	NICKY	It looks like the work of a brother...
L350231	u1851	m121	TODD	And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
L350230	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know.
L350229	u1851	m121	TODD	Why is that funny?
L350228	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah. The deep South.
L350227	u1851	m121	TODD	It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
L350226	u1846	m121	NICKY	No.
L350225	u1851	m121	TODD	Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
L350224	u1846	m121	NICKY	Off limits.
L350223	u1851	m121	TODD	Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
L350222	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. What is rent?
L350221	u1851	m121	TODD	Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
L350220	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
L350295	u1846	m121	NICKY	Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
L350294	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
L350288	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know?
L350287	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	"And if that is your so-called ""flask,"" how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?"
L350286	u1846	m121	NICKY	No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
L350285	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	You callin' me a thief, my man?
L350284	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. I would like my flask back.
L350283	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	See something you like, my man?
L350282	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey...
L387158	u1915	m126	AGATHA	RUN!
L387157	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What --
L387156	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
L387153	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, Jesus...
L387152	u1915	m126	AGATHA	She's not alive, but she didn't die.
L387151	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She's still alive?
L387150	u1915	m126	AGATHA	She grew up.
L387149	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She died?
L387148	u1915	m126	AGATHA	The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
L387147	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who wanted her little girl back?
L387146	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
L387066	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I am going back.  I see myself there.
L387065	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha, you're never going back there.
L387064	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
L387063	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
L387062	u1915	m126	AGATHA	The other two will die without me.
L387061	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why?
L387060	u1915	m126	AGATHA	I have to go back.
L387059	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Someplace safe.
L387058	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Where are we going?
L386981	u1915	m126	AGATHA	But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
L386980	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
L386979	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Please, I want to go back...
L386977	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You were right.  I'm not being set up.
L386976	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Anderton --
L386975	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
L386973	u1915	m126	AGATHA	What is it?
L386972	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, God...
L386963	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
L386962	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Please --
L386961	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't.  I have to know.
L386959	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Anderton, leave.
L386958	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He's here.
L386939	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Wait.
L386938	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha...
L386937	u1915	m126	AGATHA	He won't.
L386936	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He'll turn around.
L386935	u1915	m126	AGATHA	No.  Follow him.
L386933	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
L386932	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Forget that guy --
L386931	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Drop some money.
L386927	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386926	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can you see the balloon man?
L386925	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha --
L386920	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Agatha...
L386919	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Take it.
L386914	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who?
L386913	u1915	m126	AGATHA	They're inside.
L386912	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386828	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Is it now?
L386827	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386826	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Is it now?
L386825	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
L386291	u1915	m126	AGATHA	Can you see?
L386290	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally!
L387155	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
L387154	u1928	m126	LARA	John?  What is it?
L387144	u1928	m126	LARA	I know... I do, too...
L387143	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
L387134	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Anne Lively...
L387133	u1928	m126	LARA	About who?
L387132	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Because I found out about her...
L387131	u1928	m126	LARA	Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
L387130	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Somewhere.
L387129	u1928	m126	LARA	Found?  Where?
L387128	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just some guy... they found.
L387127	u1928	m126	LARA	Then who was he?
L387126	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- but he didn't.
L386708	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- go blind.  I know.
L386707	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
L386702	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
L386701	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The nano... what?
L386700	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
L386699	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't even stand up --
L386698	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
L386697	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Here --
L386696	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How do I find the --
L386695	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
L386644	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
L386643	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
L386638	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
L386637	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You set your patients on fire!
L386636	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	They were performance pieces.
L386635	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You made those tapes...
L386634	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Yes, you did.
L386633	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I put you away --
L386631	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
L386630	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	From where?  D.C.?
L386629	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Oh, yes.
L386628	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We know each other?
L386627	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	You don't remember me, do you?
L386626	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
L386625	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It's all I could safely move.
L386624	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	That's not much.
L386620	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Whatever you say, John.
L386619	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
L386618	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Why?
L386617	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
L386616	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	And replace them with new ones.
L386615	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yeah --
L386614	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
L386613	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Right.  I know --
L386612	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
L386611	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's comforting.
L386610	u1921	m126	DR. EDDIE	Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
L387166	u1923	m126	GIDEON	It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
L387165	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Lara --
L387164	u1923	m126	GIDEON	You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
L386348	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
L386347	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
L386346	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
L386345	u1923	m126	GIDEON	"Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, ""glitch?"""
L386344	u1923	m126	GIDEON	No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here, but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
L386343	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Try again.
L386342	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
L386339	u1923	m126	GIDEON	On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
L386338	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
L386329	u1923	m126	GIDEON	"Not to mention, ""Saved by the bell""."
L386328	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	... Graveyard shift.
L386327	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Hence the expression...
L386321	u1923	m126	GIDEON	I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
L386320	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You the only sentry?
L386319	u1923	m126	GIDEON	For that, we have to go for a ride.
L386318	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Show me just Agatha's data stream.
L386317	u1923	m126	GIDEON	That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
L386316	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	This is the official composite of the three precogs?
L386315	u1923	m126	GIDEON	That's an old one.  One of our first.
L386313	u1923	m126	GIDEON	This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
L386312	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Victim's a white female.
L386310	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Drowning.
L386309	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Kill type?
L386308	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
L386307	u1923	m126	GIDEON	I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
L386306	u1923	m126	GIDEON	Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
L386305	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You the sentry?
L387313	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
L387312	u1918	m126	BURGESS	No doubt.
L387311	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
L387301	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
L387300	u1918	m126	BURGESS	People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
L387254	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
L387253	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John --
L386470	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Everybody runs.
L386469	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You can't run --
L386468	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not getting halo'd.
L386467	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John.  Please.  Listen to me --
L386463	u1918	m126	BURGESS	John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
L386462	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
L386461	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
L386460	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Can you fake the cerebral output?
L386459	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
L386458	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
L386457	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
L386456	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
L386455	u1918	m126	BURGESS	All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
L386454	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
L386453	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And who the hell is that?
L386452	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Somebody named Leo Crow.
L386451	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
L386450	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
L386449	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
L386448	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
L386376	u1918	m126	BURGESS	No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
L386375	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We won't let them.
L386374	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
L386373	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm fine, Lamar.
L386372	u1918	m126	BURGESS	What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
L386371	u1918	m126	BURGESS	In the middle of the night?
L386370	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I go running down there.
L386369	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
L386368	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm fine.
L386367	u1918	m126	BURGESS	She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
L386366	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386365	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Lara called me.
L386364	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
L386363	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
L386362	u1918	m126	BURGESS	So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
L386361	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
L386354	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
L386353	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
L386219	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tuck in your shirt.
L386218	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I understand.  What's the other thing?
L386217	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
L386216	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yes, sir.
L386215	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
L386214	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I understand.  Sir.
L386213	u1918	m126	BURGESS	You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
L386212	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Don't apologize, John.
L386211	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
L386210	u1918	m126	BURGESS	And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
L386130	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Hang on, Lamar --
L386129	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
L386128	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh-huh...
L386127	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
L386126	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The nation votes this week...
L386125	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Don't worry, Lamar.
L386124	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tell me not to worry, John.
L386506	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
L386505	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	You don't have to do this, Chief.
L386504	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Everybody runs.
L386503	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
L386092	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I show a cop on horseback.
L386091	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
L386090	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
L386089	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	"What he's doing now, we call ""scrubbing the image"", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen."
L386081	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
L386080	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Uh, sir...
L386079	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
L386078	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
L386077	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're kidding, that's today?
L386076	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
L386070	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
L386069	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Seventeen minutes.
L386424	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Take your time.
L386423	u1926	m126	JAD	Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
L386422	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
L386418	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
L386417	u1926	m126	JAD	Any ID on the shooter yet?
L386416	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Confirm with trig and image.
L386415	u1926	m126	JAD	That was easy.
L386414	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
L386409	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
L386408	u1926	m126	JAD	I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
L386407	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
L386406	u1926	m126	JAD	The victim's name is Leo Crow.
L386400	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
L386399	u1926	m126	JAD	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
L386398	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Red Ball?
L386396	u1926	m126	JAD	We're in motion on something.
L386395	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
L386278	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Go back to work.  All of you.
L386277	u1926	m126	JAD	Sir?
L386276	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Uh-huh.  Jad?
L386275	u1926	m126	JAD	Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
L386274	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
L386149	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Did Marks close the front door?!
L386148	u1926	m126	JAD	What?
L386147	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Did he close the front door?
L386146	u1926	m126	JAD	Go ahead.
L386133	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Now look at him...
L386132	u1926	m126	JAD	Yeah?  So?
L386131	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
L386096	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Georgetown.
L386095	u1926	m126	JAD	The mall?
L386094	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No maglev system.
L386093	u1926	m126	JAD	Somewhere near the capital?
L386068	u1926	m126	JAD	From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
L386067	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
L386066	u1926	m126	JAD	Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
L386057	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Run the subscription list...
L386056	u1926	m126	JAD	We can't grab it...
L386041	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
L386040	u1926	m126	JAD	We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
L386039	u1926	m126	JAD	Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
L386038	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Okay, Jad, what's coming?
L386445	u1934	m126	WITWER	Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
L386444	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You gonna tell on me?
L386443	u1934	m126	WITWER	It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
L386442	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
L386441	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You set me up...
L386288	u1934	m126	WITWER	I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
L386287	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
L386286	u1934	m126	WITWER	Flaws.
L386285	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
L386284	u1934	m126	WITWER	At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
L386281	u1934	m126	WITWER	I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
L386280	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What does he think of your chosen line of work?
L386279	u1934	m126	WITWER	Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
L386273	u1934	m126	WITWER	The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
L386272	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just a nickname.
L386271	u1934	m126	WITWER	"But you call this room the ""temple""."
L386270	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
L386269	u1934	m126	WITWER	I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
L386251	u1934	m126	WITWER	I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
L386250	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	There's no question.  You don't have any.
L386249	u1934	m126	WITWER	If it's a question of authority.
L386248	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Maybe you didn't hear me.
L386247	u1934	m126	WITWER	So I'll be the first one to go in then?
L386246	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
L386245	u1934	m126	WITWER	Really?  You've never been inside?
L386244	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
L386243	u1934	m126	WITWER	To them.
L386242	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	To Hineman?
L386241	u1934	m126	WITWER	Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
L386240	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
L386237	u1934	m126	WITWER	Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
L386236	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
L386235	u1934	m126	WITWER	You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
L386234	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
L386233	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
L386232	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes.
L386231	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're certain?
L386230	u1934	m126	WITWER	Because it was going to fall.
L386229	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why did you catch that?
L386227	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Yes, it is.
L386226	u1934	m126	WITWER	But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
L386140	u1934	m126	WITWER	You mind if I tag along?
L386139	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
L386138	u1934	m126	WITWER	As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
L386087	u1934	m126	WITWER	Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
L386086	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
L386792	u1933	m126	WALLY	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
L386791	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Just go to the beginning!
L386784	u1933	m126	WALLY	There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
L386783	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Are these all of her previsions?
L386777	u1933	m126	WALLY	Oh... Hi, John.
L386776	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
L386775	u1933	m126	WALLY	Do I know you?  Who are you?
L386774	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally, listen to me...
L386301	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She said...
L386300	u1933	m126	WALLY	To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
L386299	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She spoke to me.
L386298	u1933	m126	WALLY	It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
L386297	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She was looking right at me.
L386296	u1933	m126	WALLY	She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
L386295	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
L386294	u1933	m126	WALLY	Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
L386266	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It helps if you don't think of them as human.
L386265	u1933	m126	WALLY	They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
L386257	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
L386256	u1933	m126	WALLY	I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
L386911	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh, I'll try...
L386910	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus, play it back...
L386903	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I guess that's all of it.
L386902	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What happened?  Where's the rest?
L386898	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Tell me how.
L386897	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Stop --
L386891	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Then take her to Radio Shack.
L386890	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	They don't belong to anybody.
L386889	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
L386888	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So now I need you to hack into her.
L386887	u1929	m126	RUFUS	So?
L386886	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
L386885	u1929	m126	RUFUS	No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
L386884	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
L386883	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
L386882	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
L386881	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Are you reading my mind right now?
L386879	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's right.
L386878	u1929	m126	RUFUS	She's a precog?
L386877	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Rufus.  She's a precog.
L386876	u1929	m126	RUFUS	I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
L386875	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Well, hello there, honey-pie.
L386874	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I need help with her.
L386873	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
L386872	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I need your help.
L386871	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
L387192	u1931	m126	SEAN	Hold your breath, Dad...
L387191	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean, wait...
L387190	u1931	m126	SEAN	I'm your son.  I'm you.
L387189	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who are you?
L387188	u1931	m126	SEAN	Good-bye, Dad...
L387187	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I wanted to.
L387186	u1931	m126	SEAN	I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
L387185	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I was looking for you...
L387184	u1931	m126	SEAN	The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
L387183	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I forgive you...
L387182	u1931	m126	SEAN	Once I even told him I loved him.
L387181	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I forgive you.
L387180	u1931	m126	SEAN	I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
L387179	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean --
L387178	u1931	m126	SEAN	The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
L387177	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Oh, Sean --
L387176	u1931	m126	SEAN	No.  He got tired of pretending.
L387175	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're alive?
L387174	u1931	m126	SEAN	I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
L387173	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What the hell.
L387172	u1931	m126	SEAN	Wanna hear something funny?
L387171	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	It's a little late for that.
L387170	u1931	m126	SEAN	You gotta have faith, Dad.
L387169	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Sean -- you're not real.
L386718	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	All right, I'll try...
L386717	u1931	m126	SEAN	Come on!
L386716	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
L386715	u1931	m126	SEAN	Okay... now let me time you.
L386200	u1931	m126	SEAN	I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
L386199	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
L386196	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What a big boy.  How old are you?
L386195	u1931	m126	SEAN	I won!
L386193	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's great.
L386192	u1931	m126	SEAN	I scored a goal!
L387028	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Good-bye, Crow.
L387027	u1919	m126	CROW	You're not gonna kill me...
L387026	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Let go of the gun.
L387025	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Tell me!
L387024	u1919	m126	CROW	Kill me!
L387023	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who made you do this?
L387022	u1919	m126	CROW	If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
L387021	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Tell me, who was it, set this up?
L387020	u1919	m126	CROW	Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
L387019	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What about the picture --
L387016	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What the fuck is going on?
L387015	u1919	m126	CROW	I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
L387014	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
L387013	u1919	m126	CROW	Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
L387012	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
L387011	u1919	m126	CROW	Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
L387007	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Who said I would?
L387006	u1919	m126	CROW	You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
L387005	u1919	m126	CROW	If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
L387004	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The precogs were wrong.
L387003	u1919	m126	CROW	But you have to.  They said you would.
L387002	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	No.
L387001	u1919	m126	CROW	You're not gonna kill me?
L386996	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	NO!
L386995	u1919	m126	CROW	It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
L386994	u1919	m126	CROW	I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
L386993	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
L386992	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	He's alive?
L386991	u1919	m126	CROW	... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
L386989	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
L386988	u1919	m126	CROW	Some -- somebody's father?
L386987	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Do you know who I am?
L386985	u1919	m126	CROW	Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
L386984	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
L386593	u1925	m126	IRIS	The female.
L386592	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Which one is that?
L386591	u1925	m126	IRIS	It's always in the more gifted of the three.
L386590	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	How do I even know which one has it?
L386585	u1925	m126	IRIS	Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
L386584	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
L386583	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're insane or you think I am.
L386582	u1925	m126	IRIS	Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
L386581	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	-- and then walk out.
L386580	u1925	m126	IRIS	If... you have one.
L386579	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
L386578	u1925	m126	IRIS	Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
L386577	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Where?
L386576	u1925	m126	IRIS	The safest place of all.
L386575	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What safe place is that?
L386574	u1925	m126	IRIS	I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
L386573	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You said they're destroyed.
L386572	u1925	m126	IRIS	You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
L386571	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why should I trust you?
L386570	u1925	m126	IRIS	Hold that thought.
L386569	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not gonna kill anybody.
L386568	u1925	m126	IRIS	But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
L386567	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You want to bring it down.
L386566	u1925	m126	IRIS	Do you?  Really?
L386565	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I believe in that system...
L386564	u1925	m126	IRIS	The system would collapse.
L386563	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
L386562	u1925	m126	IRIS	Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
L386561	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
L386560	u1925	m126	IRIS	I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
L386559	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
L386558	u1925	m126	IRIS	I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
L386557	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
L386556	u1925	m126	IRIS	Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
L386555	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Why?
L386554	u1925	m126	IRIS	Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
L386553	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
L386552	u1925	m126	IRIS	Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
L386551	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What?
L386549	u1925	m126	IRIS	I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
L386548	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	So you won't help me?
L386547	u1925	m126	IRIS	How can you avoid a man you've never met?
L386546	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Not if I stay away from him.
L386545	u1925	m126	IRIS	And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
L386544	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
L386543	u1925	m126	IRIS	So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
L386542	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You say some of the children died?
L386541	u1925	m126	IRIS	Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
L386540	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	And how did Lamar become involved?
L386539	u1925	m126	IRIS	It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
L386537	u1925	m126	IRIS	You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
L386536	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You're talking about the precogs...
L386535	u1925	m126	IRIS	The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
L386534	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	Heal who?
L386533	u1925	m126	IRIS	I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
L386532	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You don't seem all that proud.
L386531	u1925	m126	IRIS	If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
L386530	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	What's so funny?
L386528	u1925	m126	IRIS	And how would I know that?
L386527	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
L386526	u1925	m126	IRIS	Just what is it you think I can do for you?
L386522	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm... not... a... killer.
L386521	u1925	m126	IRIS	You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
L386516	u1925	m126	IRIS	The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
L386515	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	The what?
L386514	u1925	m126	IRIS	Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
L386513	u1916	m126	ANDERTON	I'm a little dizzy...
L386512	u1925	m126	IRIS	Something wrong?
L387054	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
L387053	u1928	m126	LARA	Then how did he --
L387052	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
L387051	u1928	m126	LARA	Oh, God, what did you do?
L387050	u1917	m126	ANDERTON'S VOICE	He's dead, Lara.
L387049	u1928	m126	LARA	John?
L387225	u1928	m126	LARA	Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
L387224	u1918	m126	BURGESS	All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
L387223	u1928	m126	LARA	Lamar --
L387222	u1918	m126	BURGESS	But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
L387220	u1928	m126	LARA	No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
L387219	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I understand.
L387217	u1928	m126	LARA	No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
L387216	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Sean --
L387215	u1928	m126	LARA	Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
L387213	u1928	m126	LARA	He also said Crow was a fake.
L387212	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We know why John was tagged.
L387211	u1928	m126	LARA	"John said something about him being set up because he ""found out about her."""
L387210	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't know who that is.
L387209	u1928	m126	LARA	Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
L387208	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Who?
L387205	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
L387204	u1928	m126	LARA	I thought you were retiring?
L387203	u1918	m126	BURGESS	It's insanity around here.
L387197	u1928	m126	LARA	You look great.
L387196	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
L387194	u1928	m126	LARA	No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
L387193	u1918	m126	BURGESS	This is all my fault.
L387251	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Thank you.  This is Burgess.
L387250	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	You have an emergency call on your private line.
L387243	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	I padded your expense account for the last six months.
L387242	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How did you get this?
L387241	u1918	m126	BURGESS	My God...
L387240	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	Congratulations, sir.
L387227	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I'll be right there.
L387226	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	Sir, the press conference is starting.
L387202	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Not.  Now.
L387201	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	He just wanted a few minutes before --
L387200	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Tell him not now.
L387199	u1932	m126	SECRETARY	The guy from USA Today is here.
L387104	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
L387103	u1934	m126	WITWER	What?
L387102	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Shhh.  You know what I hear?
L387101	u1934	m126	WITWER	Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
L387100	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Yes.
L387099	u1934	m126	WITWER	So there is a way to fool the system?
L387098	u1918	m126	BURGESS	We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
L387097	u1934	m126	WITWER	Precog Deja Vu...
L387096	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
L387095	u1934	m126	WITWER	By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
L387094	u1918	m126	BURGESS	How?
L387093	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
L387092	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
L387091	u1934	m126	WITWER	I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
L387090	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
L387089	u1934	m126	WITWER	According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
L387088	u1934	m126	WITWER	This murder is happening at two different times.
L387087	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't understand --
L387086	u1934	m126	WITWER	Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
L387084	u1934	m126	WITWER	Not quite.
L387083	u1918	m126	BURGESS	It's the same prevision.
L387082	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
L387081	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
L387075	u1934	m126	WITWER	Wait, just a second...
L387074	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Good God.  What was that?
L387073	u1918	m126	BURGESS	Where are you?
L387072	u1934	m126	WITWER	I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
L387071	u1918	m126	BURGESS	What?
L387070	u1934	m126	WITWER	Lamar, I found something.
L386484	u1918	m126	BURGESS	I don't want John Anderton hurt.
L386483	u1934	m126	WITWER	Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
L386482	u1918	m126	BURGESS	He's my subordinate!
L386481	u1934	m126	WITWER	Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
L386480	u1918	m126	BURGESS	None of your damn business.
L386479	u1934	m126	WITWER	Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
L386478	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
L386477	u1934	m126	WITWER	Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
L386476	u1918	m126	BURGESS	The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
L386475	u1934	m126	WITWER	He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
L386870	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
L386869	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	No, I wanna kill my boss!
L386868	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
L386866	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
L386865	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	Right here.
L386864	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
L386863	u1920	m126	CUSTOMER	I wanna kill my boss.
L386862	u1929	m126	RUFUS	Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
L387047	u1934	m126	WITWER	None.  This was arranged.
L387046	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	How many?
L387045	u1934	m126	WITWER	"I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an ""orgy of evidence"".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?"
L387044	u1934	m126	WITWER	Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
L387043	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
L387042	u1934	m126	WITWER	What kind of cop were you before this?
L387041	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
L387040	u1934	m126	WITWER	If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
L387039	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I don't know, why?
L387038	u1934	m126	WITWER	There a maid in this hotel?
L386858	u1934	m126	WITWER	No.  He can't...
L386857	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
L386856	u1934	m126	WITWER	He's trying to prove his innocence.
L386820	u1934	m126	WITWER	She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
L386819	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	We can stop him.
L386818	u1934	m126	WITWER	It doesn't matter.  He wins.
L386768	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Two?
L386767	u1934	m126	WITWER	There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
L386604	u1934	m126	WITWER	Because he thinks he's innocent.
L386603	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
L386602	u1934	m126	WITWER	Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
L386600	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	They're everywhere.
L386599	u1934	m126	WITWER	There's thousands of units like this one.
L386598	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
L386496	u1934	m126	WITWER	Yes, I know.
L386495	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
L386473	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	What?!
L386472	u1934	m126	WITWER	Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
L386471	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
L386239	u1934	m126	WITWER	Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
L386238	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	"Because of the nature of murder.  ""There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another""."
L386221	u1934	m126	WITWER	I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
L386220	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
L386110	u1934	m126	WITWER	People have gotten the message.  Gum?
L386109	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
L386108	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	That's the Red Ball Alarm.
L386107	u1934	m126	WITWER	Can't they shut that off?
L386103	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
L386102	u1934	m126	WITWER	So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
L386098	u1934	m126	WITWER	Nice to meet you.  Gum?
L386097	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	This is Evanna, the team pilot.
L387238	u1927	m126	KNOTT	"You ""friend's"" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder..."
L387237	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	John Anderton was my friend!
L387236	u1927	m126	KNOTT	Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
L387235	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Why don't I feel like celebrating?
L386741	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	Knott!
L386740	u1927	m126	KNOTT	People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
L386729	u1927	m126	KNOTT	It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
L386728	u1922	m126	FLETCHER	I think you're swell company, Knott.
L386727	u1927	m126	KNOTT	That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
L386154	u1924	m126	HOWARD	I forgot my glasses.
L386153	u1930	m126	SARAH	Howard --
L386120	u1924	m126	HOWARD	Sure.  Raincheck.
L386119	u1930	m126	SARAH	Raincheck?
L386118	u1924	m126	HOWARD	Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
L386117	u1930	m126	SARAH	I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
L386116	u1924	m126	HOWARD	We could have lunch together.
L386114	u1924	m126	HOWARD	I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
L386113	u1930	m126	SARAH	What about your meeting?
L386065	u1930	m126	SARAH	How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
L386064	u1924	m126	HOWARD	The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
L386063	u1930	m126	SARAH	Who?
L386062	u1924	m126	HOWARD	He looks familiar.
L386692	u1934	m126	WITWER	But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
L386691	u1928	m126	LARA	I haven't seen him in two years.
L386690	u1934	m126	WITWER	To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
L386689	u1928	m126	LARA	To what?  Trap him?
L386688	u1934	m126	WITWER	You know I need to use you.
L386687	u1928	m126	LARA	I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
L386686	u1934	m126	WITWER	Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
L386685	u1934	m126	WITWER	Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
L386684	u1928	m126	LARA	He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
L386683	u1934	m126	WITWER	He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
L386682	u1928	m126	LARA	The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
L386681	u1934	m126	WITWER	What was it then?
L386680	u1928	m126	LARA	It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
L386679	u1934	m126	WITWER	You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
L386678	u1928	m126	LARA	Yes.
L386677	u1934	m126	WITWER	But John was with him at the pool?
L386676	u1928	m126	LARA	It was nobody's fault.
L386675	u1934	m126	WITWER	You mean after he lost your son.
L386674	u1928	m126	LARA	Since right after we lost our son.
L386671	u1934	m126	WITWER	Have you been there recently?
L386670	u1928	m126	LARA	That was our apartment.
L386669	u1934	m126	WITWER	So you haven't seen his apartment?
L386668	u1928	m126	LARA	No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
L386667	u1934	m126	WITWER	You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
L386666	u1928	m126	LARA	No.
L386665	u1934	m126	WITWER	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
L386664	u1928	m126	LARA	I don't have any sugar either.
L386662	u1934	m126	WITWER	He's not here now, is he?
L386661	u1928	m126	LARA	We used to, every summer.
L386660	u1934	m126	WITWER	Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
L386659	u1928	m126	LARA	I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
L386658	u1934	m126	WITWER	Cream and sugar.
L386657	u1928	m126	LARA	Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
L386656	u1934	m126	WITWER	I like it.
L386655	u1928	m126	LARA	Yes.
L386654	u1934	m126	WITWER	This your work?
L386653	u1928	m126	LARA	I know who you are.
L386652	u1934	m126	WITWER	My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
L386815	u1934	m126	WITWER	Jesus...
L386814	u1933	m126	WALLY	Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
L386813	u1934	m126	WITWER	Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
L386812	u1933	m126	WALLY	You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
L386811	u1934	m126	WITWER	Wally, the other two can still function, right?
L386810	u1934	m126	WITWER	But there's still the other two.
L386809	u1933	m126	WALLY	What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
L386808	u1934	m126	WITWER	What does he want with a precog?
L386807	u1933	m126	WALLY	They've never been separated before.
L386260	u1934	m126	WITWER	Tell me how all this works.
L386259	u1933	m126	WALLY	Shhh!  They're sleeping.
L386258	u1934	m126	WITWER	Nice to meet you, Wally.
L390641	u2113	m137	ALICE	They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
L390640	u2120	m137	JULIE	4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet.
L390622	u2120	m137	JULIE	I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
L390621	u2113	m137	ALICE	Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
L390620	u2120	m137	JULIE	The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
L390473	u2120	m137	JULIE	Five CC's.
L390472	u2113	m137	ALICE	Most we've ever used is half a CC.
L390471	u2120	m137	JULIE	What's the maximum safe dose?
L390226	u2113	m137	ALICE	Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
L390225	u2120	m137	JULIE	Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
L390224	u2113	m137	ALICE	Monkeybone?
L390223	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
L390222	u2113	m137	ALICE	What?
L390221	u2120	m137	JULIE	Switch hands.
L390220	u2113	m137	ALICE	How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
L390219	u2120	m137	JULIE	He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
L390218	u2113	m137	ALICE	Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
L390217	u2120	m137	JULIE	Yeah...before your time.
L390216	u2113	m137	ALICE	When he first came in to the sleep lab?
L390215	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu. That was right about the time we met.
L390214	u2113	m137	ALICE	Who did this?
L390212	u2120	m137	JULIE	I don't know. I guess it was...
L390211	u2113	m137	ALICE	Special occasion?
L390210	u2120	m137	JULIE	Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
L390209	u2113	m137	ALICE	Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
L390257	u2124	m137	STU	I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
L390256	u2114	m137	BULL	Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
L390255	u2124	m137	STU	Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
L390254	u2114	m137	BULL	Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
L390203	u2114	m137	BULL	Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
L390202	u2124	m137	STU	I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
L390201	u2124	m137	STU	I didn't say anything.
L390200	u2114	m137	BULL	<i></i> I beg your pardon?
L390199	u2114	m137	BULL	Sad commentary, huh?
L390198	u2124	m137	STU	Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
L390196	u2114	m137	BULL	Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
L390195	u2124	m137	STU	Stu Miley.
L390194	u2114	m137	BULL	Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
L390193	u2124	m137	STU	Olive. - Where exactly am I?
L390192	u2114	m137	BULL	Olive or eyeball?
L390191	u2124	m137	STU	Uhh - martini?
L390190	u2114	m137	BULL	Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
L390189	u2114	m137	BULL	Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
L390188	u2124	m137	STU	Chasing me - animals - horrible -
L390747	u2115	m137	DEATH	Thank me next time you see me.
L390746	u2124	m137	STU	Death! Thank you!
L390745	u2115	m137	DEATH	"It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the ""Family Circus"" guy instead."
L390744	u2124	m137	STU	Back? You're sending me back?
L390743	u2115	m137	DEATH	Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
L390742	u2124	m137	STU	Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
L390740	u2124	m137	STU	Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
L390739	u2115	m137	DEATH	I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
L390738	u2124	m137	STU	DEATH!!
L390670	u2124	m137	STU	Bend over?
L390669	u2115	m137	DEATH	<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
L390668	u2124	m137	STU	Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
L390667	u2115	m137	DEATH	If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
L390666	u2115	m137	DEATH	Well - you'd need a body.
L390665	u2124	m137	STU	Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
L390664	u2115	m137	DEATH	I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
L390663	u2124	m137	STU	I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
L390662	u2115	m137	DEATH	<u>Why</u>??
L390661	u2124	m137	STU	I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
L390660	u2115	m137	DEATH	Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
L390659	u2124	m137	STU	You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
L390250	u2121	m137	KIMMY	I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
L390249	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
L390244	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
L390243	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
L390242	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
L390241	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	At the moment, yes.
L390240	u2121	m137	KIMMY	But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
L390239	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
L390238	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
L390237	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
L390648	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
L390647	u2117	m137	HERB	I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
L390646	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pi?ata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
L390645	u2117	m137	HERB	You're really gonna pop the question?
L390607	u2117	m137	HERB	And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
L390606	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
L390605	u2117	m137	HERB	Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
L390604	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	How much?
L390603	u2117	m137	HERB	Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
L390602	u2117	m137	HERB	Less.
L390601	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
L390600	u2117	m137	HERB	What's the matter?
L390614	u2117	m137	HERB	A pi?ata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
L390613	u2124	m137	STU	So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pi?ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
L390150	u2117	m137	HERB	...In some weird way I respect that.
L390149	u2124	m137	STU	My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
L390148	u2117	m137	HERB	Oh my God...you're proposing?
L390147	u2124	m137	STU	I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
L390146	u2117	m137	HERB	Why?
L390145	u2124	m137	STU	Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
L390144	u2117	m137	HERB	Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
L390143	u2124	m137	STU	I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
L390142	u2117	m137	HERB	Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
L390141	u2124	m137	STU	Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
L390140	u2117	m137	HERB	Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
L390139	u2124	m137	STU	Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
L390138	u2117	m137	HERB	Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
L390137	u2124	m137	STU	Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
L390136	u2117	m137	HERB	Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
L390651	u2120	m137	JULIE	Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
L390650	u2118	m137	HUTCH	The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
L390432	u2120	m137	JULIE	What'll it do if they pull the plug?
L390431	u2118	m137	HUTCH	You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
L390429	u2120	m137	JULIE	I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
L390428	u2118	m137	HUTCH	That's not going to stop his nightmare -
L390427	u2120	m137	JULIE	No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
L390424	u2120	m137	JULIE	He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
L390423	u2118	m137	HUTCH	Holy shit.
L390524	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
L390523	u2124	m137	STU	You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
L390522	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
L390521	u2124	m137	STU	Monkeybone...!?
L390520	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
L390519	u2124	m137	STU	But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
L390518	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
L390517	u2124	m137	STU	Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
L390516	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
L390515	u2124	m137	STU	YOU SET ME UP!!
L390514	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
L390485	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
L390484	u2124	m137	STU	NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
L390397	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
L390396	u2124	m137	STU	Land of Death. How do I get there?
L390393	u2124	m137	STU	Hyp, I'll do anything.
L390392	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
L390391	u2124	m137	STU	Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
L390388	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
L390387	u2124	m137	STU	You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
L390386	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
L390385	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
L390384	u2124	m137	STU	Maybe you could talk to Death!
L390383	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
L390380	u2124	m137	STU	Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
L390379	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
L390378	u2124	m137	STU	Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
L390374	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
L390373	u2124	m137	STU	I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
L390371	u2124	m137	STU	Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
L390370	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
L390369	u2124	m137	STU	Tell me what?
L390368	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
L390366	u2124	m137	STU	Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
L390365	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Uh huh. And?
L390364	u2124	m137	STU	Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
L390363	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
L390702	u2120	m137	JULIE	"He called me ""Doc."""
L390701	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
L390698	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
L390697	u2120	m137	JULIE	But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
L390696	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
L390695	u2120	m137	JULIE	It looks so...<u>new</u>.
L390694	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
L390598	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
L390597	u2120	m137	JULIE	You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
L390596	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
L390595	u2120	m137	JULIE	Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
L390594	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
L390593	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
L390582	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
L390581	u2120	m137	JULIE	What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
L390574	u2120	m137	JULIE	I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
L390573	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
L390571	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	I need a new PR guy.
L390570	u2120	m137	JULIE	They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
L390569	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	"Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. ""Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma"" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?"
L390568	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
L390567	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
L390546	u2120	m137	JULIE	Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
L390545	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Got a doctor on duty.
L390544	u2120	m137	JULIE	You sure this is...medically advisable?
L390543	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Ohhh, nothing.
L390542	u2120	m137	JULIE	What are you watching?
L390538	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	<i></i> In what way?
L390537	u2120	m137	JULIE	You're acting kind of...odd.
L390536	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Sure. Why?
L390535	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu, are you...feeling okay?
L390534	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Bitchin' good cake.
L390532	u2120	m137	JULIE	Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
L390531	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
L390530	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
L390529	u2120	m137	JULIE	Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
L390758	u2124	m137	STU	My <u>tail</u> itches.
L390757	u2120	m137	JULIE	What's the matter?
L390756	u2124	m137	STU	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
L390755	u2120	m137	JULIE	Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
L390550	u2120	m137	JULIE	It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
L390549	u2124	m137	STU	How was it? I don't recall.
L390490	u2124	m137	STU	Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
L390489	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu?
L390171	u2124	m137	STU	I'd better go report this...
L390170	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
L390166	u2124	m137	STU	Are you okay??
L390165	u2120	m137	JULIE	I don't think so.
L390164	u2124	m137	STU	Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
L390162	u2124	m137	STU	I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
L390161	u2120	m137	JULIE	<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
L390160	u2124	m137	STU	I might wake up.
L390159	u2120	m137	JULIE	"What's the ""bad"" part?"
L390158	u2124	m137	STU	I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
L390157	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
L390156	u2124	m137	STU	The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
L390155	u2120	m137	JULIE	Who?
L390154	u2124	m137	STU	Look at this! He won't let us leave!
L390135	u2124	m137	STU	Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
L390134	u2120	m137	JULIE	Can't you give it to me later?
L390133	u2124	m137	STU	That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
L390132	u2120	m137	JULIE	It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
L390131	u2124	m137	STU	They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
L390130	u2120	m137	JULIE	You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
L390322	u2121	m137	KIMMY	This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
L390321	u2120	m137	JULIE	Kimmy! What's the matter?
L390248	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Give me a date, Doctor.
L390247	u2120	m137	JULIE	It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
L390246	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
L390245	u2120	m137	JULIE	Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
L390235	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
L390234	u2120	m137	JULIE	The ring...
L390233	u2121	m137	KIMMY	I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
L390232	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
L390231	u2121	m137	KIMMY	An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
L390230	u2120	m137	JULIE	When'd you get in?
L390229	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
L390638	u2124	m137	STU	Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
L390637	u2122	m137	KITTY	Go. Just <u>go</u>.
L390636	u2122	m137	KITTY	<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
L390635	u2124	m137	STU	How am I gonna get past the guards?
L390634	u2122	m137	KITTY	You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
L390633	u2124	m137	STU	You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
L390632	u2122	m137	KITTY	Don't ask where I got it.
L390563	u2124	m137	STU	Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
L390562	u2122	m137	KITTY	You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
L390561	u2124	m137	STU	Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
L390560	u2122	m137	KITTY	I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
L390276	u2124	m137	STU	Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
L390275	u2122	m137	KITTY	Hypnos?
L390272	u2122	m137	KITTY	Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
L390271	u2124	m137	STU	Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
L390481	u2124	m137	STU	Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
L390480	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
L390479	u2124	m137	STU	You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
L390478	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
L390477	u2124	m137	STU	It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
L390476	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
L390475	u2124	m137	STU	You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
L390467	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Isn't that Lulu?
L390466	u2124	m137	STU	What?
L390465	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu...LOOK!
L390464	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	There's a thing here! There's a switch!
L390463	u2124	m137	STU	IT'S NOT WORKING.
L390462	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu...Stu...
L390420	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I don't <u>know</u>.
L390419	u2124	m137	STU	Where'd he go??
L390418	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
L390417	u2124	m137	STU	He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
L390408	u2124	m137	STU	Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
L390407	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
L390406	u2124	m137	STU	All right. You can come.
L390405	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
L390404	u2124	m137	STU	No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
L390403	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
L390402	u2124	m137	STU	<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
L390401	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
L390400	u2124	m137	STU	Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
L390399	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
L390382	u2124	m137	STU	Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
L390381	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
L390376	u2124	m137	STU	Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
L390375	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
L390362	u2124	m137	STU	Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
L390361	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
L390360	u2124	m137	STU	How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
L390325	u2124	m137	STU	Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
L390324	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
L390307	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
L390306	u2124	m137	STU	I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
L390305	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
L390304	u2124	m137	STU	<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
L390303	u2124	m137	STU	<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
L390302	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
L390301	u2124	m137	STU	He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
L390291	u2124	m137	STU	Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
L390290	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
L390288	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
L390287	u2124	m137	STU	<u>What</u> union?
L390286	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I'm reportin' this to my union!!

L390283	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
L390280	u2124	m137	STU	<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
L390279	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
L390274	u2124	m137	STU	I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
L390273	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
L390267	u2124	m137	STU	Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
L390266	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.

L390263	u2124	m137	STU	Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
L390262	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.

L41066	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	"Together in Paris! Oh, when can we be ""together in Paris?!"
L41065	u3674	m242	TATIANA	It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
L41064	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
L41063	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I know, but I had to because . . .
L41062	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
L41061	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	How to read.
L41060	u3674	m242	TATIANA	What were you showing her?
L41059	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I was showing Sonya something . . .
L41058	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Why were you so late tonight
L41132	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then come find me.
L41131	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
L41130	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
L41129	u3670	m242	GREGOR	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
L41128	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have to go now, before it gets light.
L41123	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm not sure but look. . .
L41122	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Where is your home, Anya?
L41117	u3667	m242	ANYA	No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
L41116	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Are you running away?
L41592	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
L41591	u3667	m242	ANYA	Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
L41590	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
L41586	u3667	m242	ANYA	Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
L41585	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41584	u3667	m242	ANYA	Poor Meetoo!
L41583	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41582	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
L41397	u3667	m242	ANYA	Not you. Him.
L41396	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I shant!
L41395	u3667	m242	ANYA	You'll laugh.
L41394	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Come out! I can do alterations.
L41393	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I look ridiculous!
L41383	u3667	m242	ANYA	You must have.
L41382	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Did I tell you that?
L41373	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
L41372	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We're just going to refresh your memory...
L41368	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
L41367	u3667	m242	ANYA	Who's Sophie?
L41366	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
L41356	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm fine.
L41355	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Is everyone all right?
L41348	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
L41347	u3667	m242	ANYA	Noooo....
L41242	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
L41241	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
L41201	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Good day!
L41200	u3667	m242	ANYA	Well, I don't have any money . . .
L41199	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
L41198	u3667	m242	ANYA	I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
L41197	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Who did you hear it from?
L41633	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'll never let go!
L41632	u3667	m242	ANYA	Don't let me go!
L41621	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya... where are we?
L41620	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri?
L41559	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
L41497	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
L41496	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No! Well, yes, but
L41495	u3667	m242	ANYA	Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
L41494	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya, wait!
L41486	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Don't be
L41485	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm so scared...
L41447	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
L41446	u3667	m242	ANYA	Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
L41445	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Nervous?
L41434	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's okay. Didn't hurt..
L41433	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh! I'm sorry...
L41412	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
L41411	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry.
L41410	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
L41409	u3667	m242	ANYA	I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
L41408	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
L41407	u3667	m242	ANYA	Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
L41406	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Sad?
L41405	u3667	m242	ANYA	It's so beautiful ... and sad.
L41400	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's not you - it's the dress!
L41399	u3667	m242	ANYA	You said you wouldn't laugh!
L41389	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
L41388	u3667	m242	ANYA	What a beautiful ship!
L41386	u3667	m242	ANYA	The dessert fork!
L41385	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's the best fork of all
L41384	u3667	m242	ANYA	...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
L41381	u3667	m242	ANYA	Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
L41380	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Every Russian family has one..
L41371	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You are the Princess.
L41370	u3667	m242	ANYA	You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
L41354	u3667	m242	ANYA	You shouldn't have pushed us!
L41353	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You must enjoy causing me pain!
L41351	u3667	m242	ANYA	No!
L41350	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on!
L41346	u3667	m242	ANYA	HUH?!
L41345	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Now just get off the train.
L41344	u3667	m242	ANYA	Forged papers! Now, what?!
L41342	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Trying... to... breathe...
L41341	u3667	m242	ANYA	Just what do you think you're doing?!
L41340	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why?
L41339	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on up!
L41334	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
L41333	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm going to stretch my legs
L41318	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I was all out of dynamite!
L41317	u3667	m242	ANYA	By pulling my hair?!
L41316	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
L41315	u3667	m242	ANYA	Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
L41314	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
L41248	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
L41247	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You never thought of the possibility?
L41245	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
L41244	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have my reasons.
L41243	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Why do you want to go to Paris?
L41239	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
L41238	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
L41237	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
L41236	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
L41235	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What happened to your parents?
L41234	u3669	m242	DMITRI	People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
L41222	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Who are you?!
L41221	u3667	m242	ANYA	AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
L41195	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
L41194	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
L41193	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Ouch!  That really hurt!
L41605	u3674	m242	TATIANA	And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
L41604	u3667	m242	ANYA	I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
L41602	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Yes, you do. You do.
L41601	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
L41600	u3674	m242	TATIANA	This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
L41599	u3667	m242	ANYA	And this is my future. This is who I am!
L41598	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
L41597	u3667	m242	ANYA	I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
L41596	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Is it? Is this what you want?
L41595	u3667	m242	ANYA	If I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
L41594	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
L41593	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why does everyone have to act that way?
L41589	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
L41588	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri didn't want the money?
L41579	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
L41578	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
L41577	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't you, child?
L41533	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
L41532	u3667	m242	ANYA	No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
L41531	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
L41525	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
L41524	u3667	m242	ANYA	... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
L41519	u3667	m242	ANYA	THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
L41518	u3674	m242	TATIANA	PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
L41514	u3667	m242	ANYA	I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
L41513	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Do you remember this?
L41512	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
L41511	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Who are you, child?
L41474	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Shut up!
L41473	u3668	m242	BARTOK	PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
L41431	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
L41430	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
L41427	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
L41426	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
L41417	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
L41416	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
L41415	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok... a question.
L41414	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting a chest cold..
L41361	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
L41360	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
L41288	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
L41287	u3668	m242	BARTOK	You'd lose your security deposit?
L41286	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
L41281	u3668	m242	BARTOK	"My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said ""Curses were made to be broken"". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound..."
L41280	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I cursed then all!
L41279	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
L41275	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	How do you know?
L41274	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Trust me, it's her!
L41272	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
L41271	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
L41270	u3668	m242	BARTOK	So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
L41268	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
L41267	u3668	m242	BARTOK	No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
L41266	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
L41264	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
L41263	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
L41262	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What?
L41565	u3669	m242	DMITRI	She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
L41564	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	So where will you go?
L41563	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Watch me.
L41562	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
L41470	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
L41469	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you mean?
L41468	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
L41466	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you feeling all right?
L41464	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
L41439	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It worked in Odessa...
L41438	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"The ""Odessa Dunk""?"
L41437	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"If I used the word ""bleak"" I would be optimistic."
L41436	u3669	m242	DMITRI	How is our current financial status?
L41377	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah! Let us begin!
L41376	u3669	m242	DMITRI	See? The Princess is under there ...
L41331	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Pray he's color-blind...
L41330	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	What do we do now?
L41325	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
L41324	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
L41323	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
L41322	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're a princess...
L41309	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness""."
L41308	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Wake up, your highness - we should start getting used to saying it.
L41307	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
L41305	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
L41304	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hurry up with those papers.
L41231	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ew. . .  the honest type.
L41230	u3669	m242	DMITRI	"She doesn't want to do anything ""dishonest"". . ."
L41227	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Look!
L41226	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	He's her?
L41225	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's her.
L41213	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
L41212	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What was that?
L41191	u3669	m242	DMITRI	We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
L41190	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
L41624	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Run, Anya -  go...
L41623	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I'll show you!
L41572	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
L41571	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
L41570	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
L41569	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you want?!
L41568	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
L41567	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Rasputin!
L41566	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
L41558	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
L41557	u3669	m242	DMITRI	And tell me that she's happy.
L41556	u3674	m242	TATIANA	She does.
L41555	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Promise me she'll have her home.
L41554	u3674	m242	TATIANA	That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
L41553	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I should go
L41552	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You are the boy ...
L41549	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
L41548	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
L41547	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No. Empress, you --
L41546	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
L41507	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
L41506	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
L41502	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
L41501	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
L41491	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Remove him at once.
L41490	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Please, if you'd just listen...
L41489	u3674	m242	TATIANA	How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
L41488	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
L41074	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
L41073	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I did no such thing!
L41072	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	You gave the orders!
L41071	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I had nothing to do with it!
L41070	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
L41069	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
L41462	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
L41461	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Perhaps you could convince her?
L41460	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
L41459	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
L41458	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
L41457	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
L41449	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
L41448	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
L45646	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
L45645	u3725	m245	Z	This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
L45644	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Break's over.
L45643	u3725	m245	Z	Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
L45642	u3716	m245	AZTECA	No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
L45641	u3725	m245	Z	The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
L45640	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
L45639	u3725	m245	Z	Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
L45972	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Right...because every ant's important!
L45971	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Someone who follows his heart!
L45968	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No -- an <u>individual</u>!
L45967	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Invisible!
L45966	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
L45963	u3716	m245	AZTECA	That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
L45962	u3724	m245	WEAVER	You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
L45875	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
L45874	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
L45862	u3716	m245	AZTECA	I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
L45861	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
L45860	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Are you asking me out to dinner?
L45859	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
L45858	u3716	m245	AZTECA	I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
L45852	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
L45851	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
L45850	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Tell me about it.
L45849	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I'm new...I was born yesterday.
L45848	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
L46149	u3717	m245	BALA	Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
L46148	u3720	m245	FORMICA	You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
L46147	u3717	m245	BALA	Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
L46146	u3720	m245	FORMICA	It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
L46145	u3717	m245	BALA	He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
L45677	u3717	m245	BALA	Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
L45676	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well...  I declared war!
L45675	u3717	m245	BALA	So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
L45672	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
L45671	u3717	m245	BALA	General -- we have to talk sometime!
L46263	u3717	m245	BALA	A <u>few</u>?
L46262	u3725	m245	Z	I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
L46181	u3725	m245	Z	I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
L46180	u3717	m245	BALA	Z!  what are you doing?
L46179	u3717	m245	BALA	Oh no...
L46178	u3725	m245	Z	Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
L46176	u3717	m245	BALA	There's something going on, Z --
L46175	u3725	m245	Z	Why do they have you tied up here?
L46115	u3725	m245	Z	Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
L46114	u3717	m245	BALA	You held onto this all that time?
L46113	u3725	m245	Z	Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
L46112	u3725	m245	Z	"Well, ""trouble"" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night."
L46111	u3717	m245	BALA	Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
L46110	u3725	m245	Z	So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
L46094	u3725	m245	Z	"Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. ""Insectopia""."
L46093	u3717	m245	BALA	Come on, Z.
L46079	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
L46078	u3725	m245	Z	Yes?
L46077	u3717	m245	BALA	Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
L46043	u3725	m245	Z	Let's dig in!
L46042	u3717	m245	BALA	You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
L46041	u3725	m245	Z	We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
L46039	u3717	m245	BALA	What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
L46038	u3725	m245	Z	Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
L46037	u3717	m245	BALA	Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
L46004	u3717	m245	BALA	Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
L46003	u3725	m245	Z	So what makes you so special?
L46002	u3717	m245	BALA	Well...no, but --
L46001	u3725	m245	Z	And only you can become a Queen?
L46000	u3717	m245	BALA	Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
L45999	u3725	m245	Z	Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
L45998	u3717	m245	BALA	General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
L45997	u3725	m245	Z	Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
L45994	u3717	m245	BALA	Stop fooling around in there.
L45993	u3725	m245	Z	Hlllllllp!
L45992	u3717	m245	BALA	Out here I'm just what?
L45991	u3725	m245	Z	"Listen, ""Princess"", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --"
L45990	u3717	m245	BALA	Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
L45989	u3725	m245	Z	This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
L45986	u3717	m245	BALA	Wait, I hear something!
L45985	u3725	m245	Z	Want a list?
L45984	u3717	m245	BALA	Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
L45982	u3725	m245	Z	Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
L45981	u3717	m245	BALA	We're going to die!
L45979	u3725	m245	Z	<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
L45978	u3717	m245	BALA	My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
L45977	u3725	m245	Z	Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
L45976	u3717	m245	BALA	Water...water...
L45958	u3717	m245	BALA	That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
L45957	u3725	m245	Z	I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
L45956	u3717	m245	BALA	Worker!  Come back here now!
L45955	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
L45954	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
L45953	u3725	m245	Z	Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
L45952	u3717	m245	BALA	Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
L45951	u3717	m245	BALA	I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
L45950	u3725	m245	Z	Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
L45949	u3717	m245	BALA	I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
L45948	u3725	m245	Z	Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
L45947	u3717	m245	BALA	Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
L45946	u3725	m245	Z	Well I guess that makes us even.
L45945	u3717	m245	BALA	I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
L45944	u3725	m245	Z	Look around, sweetheart.
L45943	u3717	m245	BALA	"No!  There's no such thing as ""just two ants.""  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!"
L45942	u3725	m245	Z	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
L45941	u3717	m245	BALA	Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
L45940	u3725	m245	Z	Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
L45939	u3717	m245	BALA	How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
L45938	u3725	m245	Z	Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
L45937	u3717	m245	BALA	I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
L45936	u3717	m245	BALA	Climb up that tree and get a better view!
L45935	u3725	m245	Z	Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
L45934	u3725	m245	Z	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
L45933	u3717	m245	BALA	I order you to find out where we are!
L45932	u3725	m245	Z	How should <u>I know</u>?
L45931	u3717	m245	BALA	What <u>was</u> that thing?
L45918	u3717	m245	BALA	SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
L45917	u3725	m245	Z	-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
L45916	u3717	m245	BALA	Quiet -- sshhh!!
L45915	u3725	m245	Z	That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
L45914	u3717	m245	BALA	I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
L45913	u3725	m245	Z	Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
L45912	u3717	m245	BALA	OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
L45911	u3725	m245	Z	No...as a matter of fact...
L45910	u3717	m245	BALA	He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
L45908	u3717	m245	BALA	No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
L45907	u3725	m245	Z	Divinely?
L45906	u3717	m245	BALA	You dance...
L45905	u3725	m245	Z	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
L45904	u3717	m245	BALA	No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
L45898	u3725	m245	Z	Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
L45897	u3717	m245	BALA	Yes.
L45896	u3725	m245	Z	Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
L45895	u3717	m245	BALA	I'm Princess Bala.
L45894	u3725	m245	Z	And you are...?
L45893	u3725	m245	Z	Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
L45892	u3717	m245	BALA	You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
L45761	u3717	m245	BALA	Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
L45760	u3725	m245	Z	Wait!  When can I see you again?
L45759	u3717	m245	BALA	Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
L45750	u3717	m245	BALA	Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
L45749	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
L45748	u3717	m245	BALA	You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
L45746	u3717	m245	BALA	Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
L45745	u3725	m245	Z	You -- you think I'm right?
L45744	u3717	m245	BALA	You're right!
L45743	u3725	m245	Z	Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
L45742	u3717	m245	BALA	Really?
L45741	u3725	m245	Z	Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
L45740	u3717	m245	BALA	Are you sure this is a real dance?
L45737	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>What</u>?
L45736	u3725	m245	Z	The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
L45735	u3717	m245	BALA	I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
L45734	u3725	m245	Z	So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
L45732	u3717	m245	BALA	Wanna dance?
L45731	u3725	m245	Z	What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
L45721	u3717	m245	BALA	Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
L45720	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course not --
L45719	u3717	m245	BALA	And do Princesses do improper things?
L45718	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course --
L45717	u3717	m245	BALA	I'm the Princess, aren't I?
L45716	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
L45693	u3717	m245	BALA	The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
L45692	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
L45691	u3717	m245	BALA	The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
L46192	u3717	m245	BALA	Mom!
L46191	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Bala!
L45794	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
L45793	u3717	m245	BALA	Who is that idiot?
L45684	u3717	m245	BALA	Yes...he's wonderful...
L45683	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
L45682	u3717	m245	BALA	You did?
L45681	u3723	m245	QUEEN	I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
L45667	u3717	m245	BALA	It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
L45666	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
L45847	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
L45846	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
L45845	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	I wonder...what...was it all...for...
L45844	u3725	m245	Z	Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
L45843	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
L45842	u3725	m245	Z	No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
L45841	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
L45840	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus!
L45839	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus?
L45838	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Z!  Over here!
L45826	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't get all sappy about it!
L45825	u3725	m245	Z	BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
L45819	u3725	m245	Z	Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
L45818	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
L45814	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Superior numbers, kid!
L45813	u3725	m245	Z	So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
L45811	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
L45810	u3725	m245	Z	Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
L45805	u3725	m245	Z	Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
L45804	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	No -- we're going to attack the termites!
L45803	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
L45802	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
L45799	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
L45798	u3725	m245	Z	I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
L45797	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	You new, kid?
L46250	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
L46249	u3720	m245	FORMICA	What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
L46035	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Ant Team Six...
L46034	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
L46033	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
L46032	u3720	m245	FORMICA	"What do we have on this ""Insectopia""?"
L46014	u3720	m245	FORMICA	No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
L46013	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
L46012	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
L46008	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
L46007	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
L45679	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Duty calls!
L45678	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
L45674	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Outstanding.  Princess...?
L45673	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
L45664	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
L45663	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
L46027	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No, sir!
L46026	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Not that one.  Or that one.
L46025	u3724	m245	WEAVER	That's correct, sir!
L46024	u3720	m245	FORMICA	We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
L46023	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Okay, son.
L46022	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I...I have no idea, sir.
L46021	u3720	m245	FORMICA	So tell me.  Where's Z?
L46020	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Thank you, sir.
L46019	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Good.  You're a good soldier.
L46018	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Oh, no, sir!
L46017	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
L46016	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
L46015	u3720	m245	FORMICA	So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
L45922	u3725	m245	Z	Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
L45921	u3720	m245	FORMICA	ARREST HIM!
L45920	u3725	m245	Z	Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
L45919	u3720	m245	FORMICA	What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
L45903	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, of course --
L45902	u3720	m245	FORMICA	May I cut in?
L45889	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
L45888	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
L45887	u3725	m245	Z	"Well I, I don't think ""living it up"" is the right term -- how about ""working themselves to death""?"
L45886	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
L45885	u3725	m245	Z	...Not enough food?
L45884	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
L45883	u3725	m245	Z	Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
L45882	u3720	m245	FORMICA	In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
L45881	u3725	m245	Z	So...you two are in love?
L45880	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Affirmative.
L45879	u3725	m245	Z	Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
L45878	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
L45877	u3725	m245	Z	Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
L45876	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
L45873	u3725	m245	Z	ONE TO NOTHING!
L45872	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
L45871	u3725	m245	Z	Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
L45870	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
L45869	u3725	m245	Z	No -- you -- you don't understand!
L45788	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
L45787	u3725	m245	Z	Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
L45786	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
L45785	u3725	m245	Z	Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
L46188	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Alright, let's move out!
L46187	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
L46186	u3720	m245	FORMICA	'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
L46185	u3723	m245	QUEEN	But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
L46184	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
L45901	u3720	m245	FORMICA	They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
L45900	u3723	m245	QUEEN	All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
L45670	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
L45669	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
L45668	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
L45661	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
L45660	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
L45659	u3723	m245	QUEEN	No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
L45658	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
L45657	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes, what else?
L45656	u3720	m245	FORMICA	We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
L45655	u3723	m245	QUEEN	General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
L45635	u3725	m245	Z	But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
L45634	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	"You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, ""Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."""
L45633	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
L45632	u3725	m245	Z	...Ants...
L45631	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	What do you see out there?
L45630	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	I'm glad you asked me that question!
L45629	u3725	m245	Z	Why are we so successful?
L45628	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Ask me why we're so successful.
L45626	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	"YES!!!  You know, people ask me, ""Doctor, why are you always happy?"" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?"
L45625	u3725	m245	Z	...I should?
L45624	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
L45623	u3725	m245	Z	I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
L46222	u3724	m245	WEAVER	You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
L46221	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
L45777	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
L45776	u3725	m245	Z	What do I do?
L45775	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah, I know.
L45774	u3725	m245	Z	You're a real buddy.
L45773	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Wear this.
L45772	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
L45771	u3725	m245	Z	You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
L45770	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
L45769	u3725	m245	Z	Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
L45768	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I can't think of any.
L45767	u3725	m245	Z	You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
L45766	u3725	m245	Z	What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
L45765	u3724	m245	WEAVER	It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
L45764	u3725	m245	Z	Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
L45763	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
L45726	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
L45725	u3725	m245	Z	I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
L45724	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Time to cut a rug, Z!
L45715	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
L45714	u3725	m245	Z	Hey, did you hear what he said?!
L45709	u3725	m245	Z	Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
L45708	u3724	m245	WEAVER	And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
L45707	u3725	m245	Z	Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
L45706	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
L45705	u3725	m245	Z	I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
L45704	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
L45703	u3725	m245	Z	Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
L45702	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
L45701	u3725	m245	Z	Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
L45700	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
L45699	u3725	m245	Z	Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
L45696	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I'll be back.
L45695	u3725	m245	Z	We declared war again?  Are you scared?
L69988	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"Right.  Sure.  And ""Peace on earth, good will toward men."""
L69987	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
L69986	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Yes, I suppose that we did.
L69985	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I guess this mean we won.
L69860	u3912	m259	BRUCE	You'll never guess.
L69859	u3910	m259	ALFRED	"Ah.  ""Who"", may I ask, are you going ""as""?"
L69858	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
L69857	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
L69839	u3910	m259	ALFRED	I think I'll take the stairs.
L69838	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Affair ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
L69837	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
L69781	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Alright, thanks.
L69780	u3910	m259	ALFRED	I will relay the message.
L69779	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb ""Be my girlfriend way,"" but --"
L69778	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
L69777	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
L69517	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No, actually I feel worse.
L69516	u3910	m259	ALFRED	I suppose you feel better now, sir.
L69508	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
L69507	u3910	m259	ALFRED	It's vichyssoise, sir.
L69506	u3912	m259	BRUCE	It's cold.
L69479	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
L69478	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
L69958	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Wrong on both counts.
L69957	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
L69956	u3911	m259	BATMAN	First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
L69809	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
L69808	u3911	m259	BATMAN	I tried to grab you -- save you --
L69807	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
L69806	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
L69805	u3911	m259	BATMAN	A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
L69794	u3911	m259	BATMAN	We do.
L69793	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
L69673	u3911	m259	BATMAN	...four, five.
L69672	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
L69671	u3911	m259	BATMAN	I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
L69670	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	"Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on ""them"" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?"
L69669	u3911	m259	BATMAN	"A ""he-man""?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of."
L69667	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
L69666	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Hanging on every word.
L69665	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
L69664	u3911	m259	BATMAN	I'm -- sorry, I --
L69663	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	How could you?  I'm a woman...
L69662	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Shreck's.  You --
L69661	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Where's the fire?
L69944	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Maybe you're right.
L69943	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
L69658	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Things change.
L69657	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
L69656	u3911	m259	BATMAN	What're you really after?
L69655	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Better than you know, Bat-boy.
L69654	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
L69653	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
L69652	u3911	m259	BATMAN	You're not the Mayor.
L69651	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
L69650	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Admiring your handiwork?
L69893	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
L69892	u3918	m259	SELINA	... What do we do?
L69888	u3912	m259	BRUCE	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
L69887	u3918	m259	SELINA	A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
L69886	u3918	m259	SELINA	I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
L69885	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
L69884	u3918	m259	SELINA	Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
L69879	u3918	m259	SELINA	You first.
L69878	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
L69877	u3918	m259	SELINA	Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
L69876	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Y'mean take off our costumes?
L69875	u3918	m259	SELINA	There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
L69873	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No hard feelings?
L69872	u3918	m259	SELINA	'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
L69871	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
L69772	u3912	m259	BRUCE	What're you doing three dates from now?
L69771	u3918	m259	SELINA	Nor I, on the second.
L69770	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
L69769	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
L69768	u3918	m259	SELINA	"It's the so-called ""normal"" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited."
L69767	u3912	m259	BRUCE	If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
L69766	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Well?  Was ""Vicki"" right?  About your difficulty with duality?"
L69765	u3918	m259	SELINA	Sure.
L69764	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Photojournalist.
L69763	u3918	m259	SELINA	Vicki.  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
L69762	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
L69761	u3918	m259	SELINA	And the truth frightened her?
L69760	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Nope, I told her everything.
L69759	u3918	m259	SELINA	What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
L69758	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Had one.  Didn't work.
L69757	u3918	m259	SELINA	Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
L69756	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
L69755	u3918	m259	SELINA	I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
L69748	u3918	m259	SELINA	Yes and no...
L69747	u3912	m259	BRUCE	... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
L69746	u3918	m259	SELINA	We?  You and...
L69745	u3912	m259	BRUCE	... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
L69744	u3918	m259	SELINA	Yeah?  Me too...
L69743	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
L69742	u3918	m259	SELINA	No darker than yours, Bruce.
L69741	u3912	m259	BRUCE	You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
L69740	u3918	m259	SELINA	I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
L69739	u3912	m259	BRUCE	You almost sound enthusiastic.
L69738	u3918	m259	SELINA	-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
L69737	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
L69736	u3918	m259	SELINA	"You're not coming to that, are you?  ""The Relighting of the Tree"" thing?"
L69735	u3918	m259	SELINA	"I heard on TV, ""Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds.""  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?"
L69734	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"And it's not even accurate ... I mean, ""Batman Blows It""?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage."
L69733	u3918	m259	SELINA	The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
L69731	u3918	m259	SELINA	Treat to be here.
L69730	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
L69729	u3918	m259	SELINA	Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
L69728	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
L69586	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Oh.  ""Kyle."""
L69585	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
L69584	u3918	m259	SELINA	Pouring myself into my work.
L69580	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I'm tempted.
L69579	u3918	m259	SELINA	I'm listed.
L69578	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Well, I could ... free up some time...
L69577	u3918	m259	SELINA	Well that's a ... long story ...
L69576	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
L69575	u3918	m259	SELINA	You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
L69570	u3918	m259	SELINA	Yes and no ...
L69569	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Didn't I say that?
L69568	u3918	m259	SELINA	You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
L69567	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
L69566	u3918	m259	SELINA	Have we?
L69565	u3912	m259	BRUCE	We've met.
L69869	u3916	m259	MAX	Yawn.
L69868	u3912	m259	BRUCE	It does to me.
L69867	u3916	m259	MAX	"I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the ""mayor""?"
L69866	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
L69865	u3916	m259	MAX	Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
L69572	u3916	m259	MAX	Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
L69571	u3912	m259	BRUCE	What happened?
L69559	u3916	m259	MAX	Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
L69558	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Oswald is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
L69557	u3916	m259	MAX	Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
L69556	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"Not compared to that ""Cobblepot"" person you're promoting..."
L69555	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I'm not scared of you, Max.
L69554	u3916	m259	MAX	Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
L69553	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
L69552	u3916	m259	MAX	If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
L69547	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
L69546	u3916	m259	MAX	I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
L69545	u3916	m259	MAX	Weird, huh?
L69544	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No.  No glass on the inside.
L69543	u3916	m259	MAX	Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
L69542	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
L69967	u3916	m259	MAX	One way to find out?
L69966	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
L69965	u3916	m259	MAX	Was.
L69964	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
L69963	u3916	m259	MAX	Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
L69954	u3916	m259	MAX	Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
L69953	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
L69952	u3916	m259	MAX	Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
L69951	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
L69950	u3916	m259	MAX	My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
L69949	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Your blood, Max.
L69948	u3916	m259	MAX	I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
L69818	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
L69817	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
L69816	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
L69815	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
L69814	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
L69813	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Let's consummate our fiendish union!
L69721	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
L69720	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
L69719	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
L69718	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
L69717	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
L69711	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
L69710	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Y'mean frame him?
L69709	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
L69708	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
L69707	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
L69706	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
L69705	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
L69703	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
L69702	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
L69701	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
L69700	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
L69699	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
L69589	u3916	m259	MAX	Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
L69588	u3914	m259	CHIP	"You buy this ""blurry"" business?"
L69539	u3914	m259	CHIP	PMS.
L69538	u3916	m259	MAX	Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
L69537	u3914	m259	CHIP	She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
L69536	u3916	m259	MAX	I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
L69417	u3914	m259	CHIP	Dad!  Save yourself!
L69416	u3916	m259	MAX	Son!
L69941	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	My lips are sealed.
L69940	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	But who could've ... no, don't say it.
L69939	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
L69935	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	All is shrill, all is blight...
L69934	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Silent night, violent night...
L69933	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	... eight, seven...
L69932	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
L69931	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	Ten, nine...
L69907	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
L69906	u3916	m259	MAX	I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
L69905	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I don't.  So, no.
L69904	u3916	m259	MAX	Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
L69903	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
L69847	u3916	m259	MAX	I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
L69846	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
L69831	u3916	m259	MAX	Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
L69830	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
L69633	u3916	m259	MAX	Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
L69632	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
L69631	u3916	m259	MAX	Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
L69630	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
L69629	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
L69628	u3916	m259	MAX	Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
L69626	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot.  ""Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.""  ""I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"""
L69625	u3916	m259	MAX	That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
L69624	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
L69623	u3916	m259	MAX	Oswald:  We need one more thing.
L69622	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	"I could teach her my ""French flipper"" trick..."
L69621	u3916	m259	MAX	We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
L69620	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Wonder if it's worth my time.
L69610	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
L69609	u3916	m259	MAX	Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
L69608	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
L69606	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
L69605	u3916	m259	MAX	Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
L69469	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
L69468	u3916	m259	MAX	You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
L69466	u3916	m259	MAX	Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
L69465	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
L69464	u3916	m259	MAX	If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
L69463	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
L69462	u3916	m259	MAX	Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
L69460	u3916	m259	MAX	And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
L69459	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	"Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my ""human"" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted."
L69455	u3916	m259	MAX	Well it's not working.
L69454	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	No, just give you a splitting headache.
L69453	u3916	m259	MAX	"What, is that supposed to ""hypnotize"" me?"
L69449	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
L69448	u3916	m259	MAX	My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
L69447	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
L69685	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Actually I have to split.  Take a ""personal day.""  You don't mind? Max, you're tops."
L69684	u3916	m259	MAX	I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
L69683	u3918	m259	SELINA	Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
L69564	u3916	m259	MAX	Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
L69563	u3918	m259	SELINA	That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
L69562	u3916	m259	MAX	Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
L69533	u3916	m259	MAX	Actually, it's a lot like that.
L69532	u3918	m259	SELINA	Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
L69531	u3916	m259	MAX	I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
L69530	u3918	m259	SELINA	It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
L69529	u3918	m259	SELINA	Too good?
L69528	u3916	m259	MAX	And a very, very good one.
L69527	u3918	m259	SELINA	I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
L69526	u3916	m259	MAX	... Where did curiosity get the cat?
L69524	u3916	m259	MAX	And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
L69523	u3918	m259	SELINA	Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
L69522	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Well I figured that your password was ""Finster.""  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant..."
L69521	u3916	m259	MAX	Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
L69520	u3918	m259	SELINA	No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
L69519	u3916	m259	MAX	Working late?  I'm touched.
L77397	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...

L76827	u3977	m264	MARTHA	You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
L76826	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
L76808	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Oh, that's nice.
L76807	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
L76804	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
L76803	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
L76802	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
L76801	u3977	m264	MARTHA	I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
L76800	u3970	m264	BEAVIS	Yeah, we're gonna score.
L76799	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
L77349	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Thrr...
L77348	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
L77347	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	...Two...
L77343	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
L77342	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
L77341	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
L77340	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
L77337	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
L77336	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
L77335	u3971	m264	BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
L77334	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
L77333	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Who knows?
L77332	u3972	m264	BORK	Where are his pants?
L77331	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
L77329	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
L77328	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, look!
L77327	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
L77326	u3972	m264	BORK	We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
L77319	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Not now Bork.
L77318	u3972	m264	BORK	Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
L77296	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Agent Hurley...
L77295	u3972	m264	BORK	Not on him, Chief.
L77253	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
L77252	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
L77251	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
L77199	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
L77198	u3972	m264	BORK	D.C., Chief.
L77197	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
L77194	u3972	m264	BORK	Where did these guys come from?
L77193	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
L77129	u3972	m264	BORK	We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
L77128	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	That's better. Yes?
L77127	u3972	m264	BORK	Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
L77126	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
L77125	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
L77093	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Deep and hard.
L77092	u3972	m264	BORK	Cavity search...?
L77034	u3972	m264	BORK	It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
L77033	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
L77031	u3972	m264	BORK	Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
L77030	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
L77029	u3972	m264	BORK	Cut the power!
L77028	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
L77027	u3972	m264	BORK	I see it. I don't get it.
L77026	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	You see what I see, Bork?
L77003	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
L77002	u3972	m264	BORK	They look like a couple of kids chief.
L77001	u3972	m264	BORK	Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
L77000	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
L76999	u3972	m264	BORK	Ah, the witness?
L76998	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Did you give him a full cavity search?
L76997	u3972	m264	BORK	Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
L76996	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Talk ta me, Bork.
L76978	u3976	m264	FLEMMING	Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
L76977	u3972	m264	BORK	We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
L77173	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
L77172	u3978	m264	MUDDY	Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
L76784	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
L76783	u3978	m264	MUDDY	She sure does.
L76782	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
L76781	u3978	m264	MUDDY	One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
L76778	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
L76777	u3978	m264	MUDDY	She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
L76776	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
L76775	u3978	m264	MUDDY	Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
L76767	u3978	m264	MUDDY	That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
L76766	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Do her? Huh huh.
L76763	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, Butt-Head.
L76762	u3978	m264	MUDDY	Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
L77201	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
L77200	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
L76969	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
L76968	u3977	m264	MARTHA	Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
L76966	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
L76965	u3977	m264	MARTHA	This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
L76964	u3977	m264	MARTHA	That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
L76963	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Cool, huh huh huh.
L76806	u3977	m264	MARTHA	It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
L76805	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Cool. Huh huh huh.
L77142	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
L77141	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
L77140	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
L77138	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
L77137	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	You scored with two chicks?!
L77136	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
L77135	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Really? That's where we're from.
L77132	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Yup. Huh huh.
L77131	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
L77117	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
L77116	u3975	m264	DUMB GUY	Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
L76924	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
L76923	u3974	m264	DALLAS	Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
L76922	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, ten uh...
L76921	u3974	m264	DALLAS	Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
L76920	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
L76919	u3974	m264	DALLAS	Who sent ya?
L76918	u3973	m264	BUTT-HEAD	Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
L76917	u3974	m264	DALLAS	You got two seconds!
L191966	u5104	m337	VADER	And code the signal to my private chamber.
L191965	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	Yes, My Lord.
L191964	u5104	m337	VADER	Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
L191963	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
L191962	u5104	m337	VADER	The Emperor?
L191961	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	It was .... the Emperor ....
L192205	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
L192204	u5104	m337	VADER	Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
L192203	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
L191932	u5104	m337	VADER	Yes, Admiral .... soon.
L191931	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Soon, Lord Vader.
L191930	u5104	m337	VADER	Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
L191929	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
L191928	u5104	m337	VADER	Come in, Admiral.
L191927	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	My lord.
L192357	u5105	m337	YODA	No ... there is another.
L192356	u5092	m337	BEN	The boy is our last hope.
L192355	u5105	m337	YODA	Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
L192353	u5105	m337	YODA	Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
L192352	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
L192345	u5092	m337	BEN	You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
L192344	u5105	m337	YODA	Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
L192086	u5092	m337	BEN	We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
L192085	u5105	m337	YODA	Will he finish what he begins?
L192083	u5105	m337	YODA	He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
L192082	u5092	m337	BEN	He'll learn.
L192079	u5105	m337	YODA	This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
L192078	u5092	m337	BEN	He can do it.
L192073	u5092	m337	BEN	We've discussed this before.
L192072	u5105	m337	YODA	Much anger in him, like in his father.
L192071	u5092	m337	BEN	He will learn patience.
L192343	u5092	m337	BEN	Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
L192342	u5100	m337	LUKE	You won't.
L192341	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
L192340	u5100	m337	LUKE	And that is why I must go.
L192339	u5092	m337	BEN	Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
L192336	u5092	m337	BEN	But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
L192335	u5100	m337	LUKE	I feel The Force.
L192334	u5092	m337	BEN	You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
L192333	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can help them!
L192332	u5092	m337	BEN	You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
L192331	u5100	m337	LUKE	But Han and Leia will surely die.
L192330	u5092	m337	BEN	... Luke, you must not go.
L191662	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke ... you are the only hope.
L191661	u5100	m337	LUKE	Ben ... Ben ...
L191660	u5092	m337	BEN	You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
L191659	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm cold ... so cold ...
L191658	u5092	m337	BEN	You must survive, Luke.
L191657	u5092	m337	BEN	You must.  Luke, look at me!
L191656	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can't ...
L192541	u5098	m337	LANDO	We're not out of this yet.
L192540	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
L192531	u5098	m337	LANDO	Okay, okay.
L192530	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
L192527	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
L192526	u5098	m337	LANDO	Three patrol ships are heading our way.
L192440	u5098	m337	LANDO	What's wrong with him?
L192439	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks a blue streak.
L192315	u5098	m337	LANDO	Everyone's invited, of course.
L192314	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
L192258	u5098	m337	LANDO	Right.
L192257	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Growls a reserved greeting.
L192256	u5098	m337	LANDO	How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
L192415	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
L192414	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks a doleful farewell.
L192376	u5097	m337	HAN	No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
L192375	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his concern.
L192324	u5097	m337	HAN	Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
L192323	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at Han.
L192306	u5097	m337	HAN	Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
L192305	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
L192243	u5097	m337	HAN	That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
L192242	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks and growls at his boss.
L192241	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, it's been awhile.
L192549	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
L192548	u5099	m337	LEIA	Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
L192525	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
L192524	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his consternation.
L192482	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
L192481	u5099	m337	LEIA	... the power?
L192476	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his ?right on!
L192475	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
L192472	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
L192471	u5099	m337	LEIA	We should have stayed and finished them off.
L192300	u5099	m337	LEIA	What happened?
L192299	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at his master.
L192068	u5100	m337	LUKE	How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
L192067	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
L192066	u5100	m337	LUKE	Because of my father, I guess.
L192065	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
L192064	u5100	m337	LUKE	Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
L192063	u5094	m337	CREATURE	It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
L192062	u5100	m337	LUKE	Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
L192061	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Patience.  It's time to eat.
L192060	u5100	m337	LUKE	... I told you, I'm not hungry.
L192019	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
L192018	u5100	m337	LUKE	You know the Jedi Master?
L192017	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
L192016	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
L192015	u5094	m337	CREATURE	No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
L192014	u5100	m337	LUKE	Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
L192013	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mine, mine.
L192010	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
L192009	u5100	m337	LUKE	I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
L192008	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
L192007	u5100	m337	LUKE	Give me that!
L192006	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
L192005	u5100	m337	LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
L192001	u5094	m337	CREATURE	A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
L192000	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm looking for a great warrior.
L191999	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
L191998	u5100	m337	LUKE	Yeah ...
L191997	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
L191996	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
L191995	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
L191994	u5100	m337	LUKE	... Like we're being watched.
L191655	u5097	m337	HAN	Then I'll see you in Hell.
L191654	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
L191653	u5097	m337	HAN	You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
L191652	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	The temperature is dropping too fast.
L191651	u5097	m337	HAN	We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
L191650	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
L191649	u5097	m337	HAN	Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
L191648	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
L191642	u5097	m337	HAN	Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
L191641	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
L191640	u5097	m337	HAN	Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
L191639	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	Yes sir!
L192100	u5104	m337	VADER	He will join us or die, My Master.
L192099	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
L192098	u5104	m337	VADER	But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
L192097	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
L192096	u5104	m337	VADER	He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
L192095	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
L192094	u5104	m337	VADER	Our destruction?  Who?
L192093	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
L192092	u5104	m337	VADER	I have felt it.
L192091	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
L192090	u5104	m337	VADER	What is thy bidding, My Master?
L191711	u5097	m337	HAN	Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
L191710	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
L191709	u5097	m337	HAN	Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
L191603	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
L191602	u5097	m337	HAN	Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
L191601	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
L191600	u5097	m337	HAN	That's right.
L191598	u5097	m337	HAN	The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
L191597	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
L191596	u5097	m337	HAN	He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
L191595	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Good, and Commander Skywalker?
L191594	u5097	m337	HAN	There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
L191593	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
L192157	u5097	m337	HAN	Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
L192156	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
L192126	u5097	m337	HAN	Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
L192125	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
L192106	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm going to see what it is.
L192105	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	It sounds like it's trying to get in.
L191988	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
L191987	u5097	m337	HAN	You, too, golden rod.
L191969	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
L191968	u5097	m337	HAN	What are you so grouchy about?
L191907	u5097	m337	HAN	We're in trouble!
L191906	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
L191905	u5097	m337	HAN	I think we're in trouble.
L191897	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	It can wait.
L191896	u5097	m337	HAN	Sit down, and shut up!
L191895	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, I was wondering ...
L191857	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
L191856	u5097	m337	HAN	Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
L191686	u5097	m337	HAN	The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
L191685	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
L191684	u5097	m337	HAN	He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
L191644	u5097	m337	HAN	Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
L191643	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
L191636	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
L191635	u5097	m337	HAN	I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
L191634	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
L191633	u5097	m337	HAN	What is it?
L191632	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
L192417	u5097	m337	HAN	... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
L192416	u5099	m337	LEIA	... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
L192379	u5097	m337	HAN	Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
L192378	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
L192377	u5097	m337	HAN	I was worried about you.
L192308	u5097	m337	HAN	Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
L192307	u5099	m337	LEIA	No thanks.
L192304	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
L192303	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
L192302	u5099	m337	LEIA	Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
L192301	u5097	m337	HAN	He found him in a junk pile ...
L192298	u5097	m337	HAN	Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
L192297	u5099	m337	LEIA	I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
L192296	u5097	m337	HAN	Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
L192295	u5099	m337	LEIA	Has Threepio turned up yet?
L192294	u5097	m337	HAN	You look great.
L192293	u5099	m337	LEIA	You look silly.
L192292	u5097	m337	HAN	Who's staring?
L192291	u5099	m337	LEIA	What are you staring at?
L192250	u5097	m337	HAN	It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
L192249	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't like this.
L192228	u5097	m337	HAN	Let er go, Chewie.
L192227	u5099	m337	LEIA	You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
L192225	u5097	m337	HAN	No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
L192224	u5099	m337	LEIA	Can you trust him?
L192223	u5097	m337	HAN	A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
L192222	u5099	m337	LEIA	A mining colony.
L192221	u5097	m337	HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
L192220	u5099	m337	LEIA	Never heard of that system.
L192219	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
L192218	u5099	m337	LEIA	You keep logs?  My, how organized.
L192217	u5097	m337	HAN	Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
L192216	u5097	m337	HAN	Here ... near the Anoat system.
L192215	u5099	m337	LEIA	That depends.  Where are we?
L192214	u5097	m337	HAN	Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
L192213	u5099	m337	LEIA	Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
L192212	u5097	m337	HAN	The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
L192211	u5099	m337	LEIA	What'd you have in mind for your next move?
L192210	u5097	m337	HAN	Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
L192209	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
L192208	u5097	m337	HAN	Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
L192207	u5099	m337	LEIA	You could have warned him before you shut him off.
L192166	u5099	m337	LEIA	You're going to attack them?!!!
L192165	u5097	m337	HAN	Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
L192162	u5097	m337	HAN	It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
L192161	u5099	m337	LEIA	No lightspeed?
L192160	u5097	m337	HAN	Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
L192124	u5099	m337	LEIA	The entrance is collapsing!
L192123	u5097	m337	HAN	I see it Chewie, hang on.
L192122	u5099	m337	LEIA	But the tremors have stopped.
L192121	u5097	m337	HAN	Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
L192120	u5099	m337	LEIA	Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
L192112	u5097	m337	HAN	There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
L192111	u5099	m337	LEIA	Looks like some kind of Mynock.
L192108	u5097	m337	HAN	Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
L192107	u5099	m337	LEIA	Are you crazy!
L192104	u5099	m337	LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
L192103	u5097	m337	HAN	Where?
L192102	u5099	m337	LEIA	There's something out there!
L192057	u5097	m337	HAN	Try and control this ...
L192056	u5099	m337	LEIA	I do not!
L192055	u5097	m337	HAN	You mean a man you can control.
L192054	u5099	m337	LEIA	There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
L192053	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
L192052	u5099	m337	LEIA	Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
L192049	u5099	m337	LEIA	Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
L192048	u5097	m337	HAN	What are you afraid of?
L192046	u5097	m337	HAN	Why?
L192045	u5099	m337	LEIA	Stop that.
L192044	u5097	m337	HAN	That's quite a compliment.
L192043	u5099	m337	LEIA	Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
L192042	u5097	m337	HAN	You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
L192041	u5099	m337	LEIA	Yes, you do.
L192040	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
L192039	u5099	m337	LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
L192038	u5097	m337	HAN	Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
L192035	u5099	m337	LEIA	Where have I heard that before?
L192034	u5097	m337	HAN	They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
L192033	u5099	m337	LEIA	They're moving away.
L192031	u5099	m337	LEIA	Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
L192030	u5097	m337	HAN	That was no earthquake.
L191984	u5097	m337	HAN	Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
L191983	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
L191982	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, I hope you don't expect more.
L191981	u5099	m337	LEIA	Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
L191979	u5097	m337	HAN	Beautiful.
L191978	u5099	m337	LEIA	How do I look?
L191977	u5097	m337	HAN	You don't look angry.
L191976	u5099	m337	LEIA	Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
L191975	u5097	m337	HAN	Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
L191947	u5097	m337	HAN	That should do nicely.
L191946	u5099	m337	LEIA	What is it?
L191945	u5097	m337	HAN	There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
L191941	u5097	m337	HAN	Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
L191940	u5099	m337	LEIA	Now you're making sense.
L191939	u5097	m337	HAN	We've got to get out of this shower.
L191938	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm against that.
L191937	u5097	m337	HAN	But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
L191936	u5099	m337	LEIA	Good.
L191935	u5097	m337	HAN	That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
L191934	u5099	m337	LEIA	I take it back.
L191933	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
L191924	u5097	m337	HAN	Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
L191923	u5099	m337	LEIA	To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
L191922	u5097	m337	HAN	Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
L191921	u5099	m337	LEIA	Probably an asteroid field ....
L191920	u5097	m337	HAN	Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
L191919	u5099	m337	LEIA	Or you ran into something ....
L191918	u5097	m337	HAN	That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
L191894	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
L191893	u5097	m337	HAN	Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
L191892	u5097	m337	HAN	I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
L191874	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
L191873	u5097	m337	HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
L191872	u5099	m337	LEIA	This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
L191869	u5097	m337	HAN	Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
L191868	u5099	m337	LEIA	Would it help if I got out and pushed?
L191851	u5099	m337	LEIA	Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
L191850	u5097	m337	HAN	Hey!  Someone's still in here.
L191771	u5097	m337	HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
L191770	u5099	m337	LEIA	Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
L191769	u5097	m337	HAN	Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
L191768	u5099	m337	LEIA	You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
L191765	u5097	m337	HAN	Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
L191764	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't know what he's talking about.
L191759	u5099	m337	LEIA	I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
L191758	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
L191716	u5097	m337	HAN	Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
L191715	u5099	m337	LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
L191714	u5097	m337	HAN	Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
L191713	u5099	m337	LEIA	What was it?
L191712	u5097	m337	HAN	.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
L191691	u5097	m337	HAN	No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
L191690	u5099	m337	LEIA	Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
L191688	u5097	m337	HAN	Forget it.
L191687	u5099	m337	LEIA	Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
L191627	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
L191626	u5099	m337	LEIA	And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
L191625	u5097	m337	HAN	Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
L191624	u5099	m337	LEIA	We are fighting for a cause much ...
L191623	u5097	m337	HAN	There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
L191622	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
L191621	u5097	m337	HAN	Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
L191619	u5099	m337	LEIA	I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
L191618	u5097	m337	HAN	You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
L191617	u5099	m337	LEIA	And what are they, pray tell?
L191616	u5097	m337	HAN	You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
L191615	u5099	m337	LEIA	Me?  I don't know what you mean.
L191614	u5097	m337	HAN	Not you?
L191613	u5099	m337	LEIA	Yes.
L191612	u5097	m337	HAN	We?
L191611	u5099	m337	LEIA	Han, we need you here.
L191610	u5097	m337	HAN	He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
L191609	u5099	m337	LEIA	Does Luke know?
L191608	u5097	m337	HAN	That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
L191607	u5099	m337	LEIA	You said you were going to stay. What happened?
L191606	u5097	m337	HAN	Yes, Your Highness?
L191798	u5097	m337	HAN	Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
L191797	u5100	m337	LUKE	I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
L191767	u5097	m337	HAN	Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
L191766	u5100	m337	LUKE	About what?
L191761	u5097	m337	HAN	That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
L191760	u5100	m337	LUKE	Probe?  What probe?
L191757	u5097	m337	HAN	That's two you owe me, junior.
L191756	u5100	m337	LUKE	Thanks to you.
L191755	u5097	m337	HAN	Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
L191588	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
L191587	u5097	m337	HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
L191586	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
L191585	u5097	m337	HAN	Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
L192396	u5097	m337	HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
L192395	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
L192392	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
L192391	u5097	m337	HAN	All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
L192388	u5097	m337	HAN	Luke?  I don't get it.
L192387	u5098	m337	LANDO	He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
L192386	u5097	m337	HAN	You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
L192383	u5098	m337	LANDO	Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
L192382	u5097	m337	HAN	This ought to be good.
L192381	u5098	m337	LANDO	Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
L192380	u5097	m337	HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
L192327	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm sorry too.
L192326	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
L192272	u5097	m337	HAN	Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
L192271	u5098	m337	LANDO	Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
L192270	u5097	m337	HAN	How's your mining operation going?
L192269	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
L192268	u5097	m337	HAN	Hyperdrive.
L192267	u5098	m337	LANDO	That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
L192265	u5098	m337	LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
L192264	u5097	m337	HAN	Repairs ...
L192263	u5098	m337	LANDO	That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
L192255	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll bet.
L192254	u5097	m337	HAN	I always said you were a gentleman.
L192253	u5098	m337	LANDO	Are you kidding?
L192252	u5097	m337	HAN	No hard feelings?
L192251	u5098	m337	LANDO	Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
L192426	u5104	m337	VADER	I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
L192425	u5098	m337	LANDO	That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
L192424	u5104	m337	VADER	Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
L192423	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll take what's mine now.
L192403	u5104	m337	VADER	I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
L192402	u5098	m337	LANDO	We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
L192370	u5104	m337	VADER	Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
L192369	u5098	m337	LANDO	No.
L192368	u5104	m337	VADER	I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
L192367	u5098	m337	LANDO	That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
L192366	u5104	m337	VADER	You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
L192365	u5098	m337	LANDO	What about Leia and the Wookiee?
L192547	u5099	m337	LEIA	That sounds familiar.
L192546	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
L192543	u5099	m337	LEIA	Are the coordinates set?
L192542	u5098	m337	LANDO	The deflector shields are gone.
L192535	u5099	m337	LEIA	It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
L192534	u5098	m337	LANDO	Someone's falling.
L192529	u5098	m337	LANDO	Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
L192528	u5099	m337	LEIA	No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
L192523	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke needs help.  We must go back.
L192522	u5098	m337	LANDO	What?
L192521	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke!
L192520	u5098	m337	LANDO	I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
L192517	u5098	m337	LANDO	I didn't say anything?
L192516	u5099	m337	LEIA	What'd you say?
L192499	u5098	m337	LANDO	His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
L192498	u5099	m337	LEIA	We've got to find Luke.
L192489	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
L192488	u5099	m337	LEIA	You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
L192480	u5099	m337	LEIA	What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
L192479	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
L192478	u5099	m337	LEIA	You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
L192477	u5098	m337	LANDO	Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
L192446	u5098	m337	LANDO	There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
L192445	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
L192438	u5098	m337	LANDO	This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
L192437	u5099	m337	LEIA	We have no use for your kind.
L192436	u5098	m337	LANDO	Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
L192435	u5099	m337	LEIA	And when do you betray us again?
L192434	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
L192433	u5099	m337	LEIA	What's going on?
L192390	u5099	m337	LEIA	... we're the bait.
L192389	u5098	m337	LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
L192385	u5098	m337	LANDO	I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
L192384	u5099	m337	LEIA	What about Han?
L192322	u5098	m337	LANDO	Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
L192321	u5099	m337	LEIA	It's a lovely outpost.
L192320	u5098	m337	LANDO	Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
L192319	u5099	m337	LEIA	You're part of the mining guild then?
L192318	u5098	m337	LANDO	.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
L192313	u5098	m337	LANDO	Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
L192312	u5099	m337	LEIA	Thanks.
L192311	u5098	m337	LANDO	I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
L192310	u5099	m337	LEIA	Not really.
L192309	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
L192260	u5099	m337	LEIA	You may call me Leia.
L192259	u5098	m337	LANDO	Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
L191823	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
L191822	u5099	m337	LEIA	Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
L191702	u5099	m337	LEIA	What is it?
L191701	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
L191695	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Not yet.  They're working on it now.
L191694	u5099	m337	LEIA	Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
L191677	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
L191676	u5099	m337	LEIA	Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
L191675	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
L191674	u5099	m337	LEIA	I understand.
L191673	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
L192514	u5099	m337	LEIA	Let's go.
L192513	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
L192240	u5099	m337	LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
L192239	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Rather touchy, aren't they.
L192164	u5099	m337	LEIA	Well, what now?
L192163	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
L192128	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Oh my, no!
L192127	u5099	m337	LEIA	What??
L191972	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
L191971	u5099	m337	LEIA	A tremor!
L191943	u5099	m337	LEIA	Closer?!
L191942	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Closer?!
L191926	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
L191925	u5099	m337	LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
L191739	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'll be back later.
L191738	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
L191737	u5099	m337	LEIA	You rest now.
L192545	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've never seen it fail.
L192544	u5099	m337	LEIA	This hyperdrive had better work.
L192539	u5100	m337	LUKE	He'll survive.
L192538	u5099	m337	LEIA	Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
L192428	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke, no!  It's a trap.
L192427	u5100	m337	LUKE	Leia!
L191752	u5100	m337	LUKE	Snow creatures ... they're here?!
L191751	u5099	m337	LEIA	I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
L191750	u5100	m337	LUKE	Jabba the Hutt?
L191749	u5099	m337	LEIA	He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
L191748	u5100	m337	LUKE	Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
L191747	u5100	m337	LUKE	Han's leaving?
L191746	u5099	m337	LEIA	First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
L191745	u5100	m337	LUKE	What are you talking about?
L191744	u5099	m337	LEIA	That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
L191743	u5100	m337	LUKE	I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
L191742	u5099	m337	LEIA	Where are you going?
L191741	u5099	m337	LEIA	What did you say?!
L191740	u5100	m337	LUKE	Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
L191731	u5099	m337	LEIA	Me too.  I was afraid.
L191730	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
L191729	u5099	m337	LEIA	The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
L192347	u5105	m337	YODA	If it must be.  Yes.
L192346	u5100	m337	LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
L192338	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
L192337	u5105	m337	YODA	Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
L192290	u5105	m337	YODA	Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
L192289	u5100	m337	LUKE	They're my friends.
L192288	u5105	m337	YODA	Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
L192287	u5100	m337	LUKE	Will they die?
L192286	u5105	m337	YODA	It is the future you see.
L192285	u5100	m337	LUKE	I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
L192284	u5105	m337	YODA	Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
L192283	u5100	m337	LUKE	I see a city in the clouds.
L192282	u5105	m337	YODA	Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
L192281	u5100	m337	LUKE	My mind fills with so many images.
L192280	u5105	m337	YODA	Free your mind and return he will.
L192279	u5100	m337	LUKE	Ben?  Ben?
L192235	u5105	m337	YODA	Only what you take with you.
L192234	u5100	m337	LUKE	What's in there?
L192233	u5105	m337	YODA	This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
L192232	u5100	m337	LUKE	I feel cold.
L192230	u5100	m337	LUKE	Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
L192229	u5105	m337	YODA	Four this time!  The Force you feel.
L192199	u5105	m337	YODA	No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
L192198	u5100	m337	LUKE	But tell me why ...
L192197	u5105	m337	YODA	You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
L192196	u5100	m337	LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
L192195	u5105	m337	YODA	No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
L192194	u5100	m337	LUKE	Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
L192193	u5105	m337	YODA	The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
L192192	u5100	m337	LUKE	Price?  What do you mean?
L192191	u5105	m337	YODA	Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
L192190	u5100	m337	LUKE	But I feel The Force flowing!
L192189	u5105	m337	YODA	No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
L192187	u5105	m337	YODA	That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
L192186	u5100	m337	LUKE	They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
L192185	u5105	m337	YODA	That they are.
L192184	u5100	m337	LUKE	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
L192183	u5105	m337	YODA	Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
L192151	u5105	m337	YODA	That is why you fail.
L192150	u5100	m337	LUKE	I don't believe it.
L192147	u5105	m337	YODA	Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
L192146	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
L192145	u5105	m337	YODA	No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
L192144	u5100	m337	LUKE	Okay.  I'll give it a try.
L192143	u5105	m337	YODA	No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
L192142	u5100	m337	LUKE	Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
L192134	u5105	m337	YODA	Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
L192133	u5100	m337	LUKE	I thought I was in good shape.
L192132	u5105	m337	YODA	It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
L192088	u5105	m337	YODA	You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
L192087	u5100	m337	LUKE	I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
L192081	u5105	m337	YODA	You are reckless!
L192080	u5100	m337	LUKE	I have followed my feelings.
L192077	u5105	m337	YODA	To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
L192076	u5100	m337	LUKE	Why not me?
L192075	u5105	m337	YODA	Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
L192508	u5100	m337	LUKE	Never.
L192507	u5104	m337	VADER	There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
L192506	u5100	m337	LUKE	No! .... Never ....
L192505	u5104	m337	VADER	The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
L192458	u5100	m337	LUKE	Time will tell.
L192457	u5104	m337	VADER	All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
L192456	u5104	m337	VADER	That won't be necessary.
L192455	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'll die first.
L192454	u5104	m337	VADER	There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
L192453	u5100	m337	LUKE	No!
L192452	u5104	m337	VADER	Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
L192451	u5104	m337	VADER	And I too.
L192450	u5100	m337	LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
L192449	u5104	m337	VADER	The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
L191889	u5104	m337	VADER	I want that ship.
L191888	u5101	m337	PIETT	It won't get through the blockade.
L191887	u5104	m337	VADER	Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
L191886	u5101	m337	PIETT	Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
L191782	u5104	m337	VADER	Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
L191781	u5101	m337	PIETT	Yes, My Lord.
L191723	u5101	m337	PIETT	Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
L191722	u5104	m337	VADER	The Hoth System?
L330610	u6151	m410	AJAY	No.  I feel something.
L330609	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You hear something?
L330401	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
L330400	u6151	m410	AJAY	Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
L330376	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It certainly does.
L330375	u6151	m410	AJAY	It matches the pictures.
L330232	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
L330231	u6151	m410	AJAY	You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
L330230	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Sorry.  We were saying?
L330222	u6159	m410	ROLAND	A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
L330221	u6151	m410	AJAY	How do you mean?
L330220	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Just a little bit too much, I think.
L330219	u6151	m410	AJAY	But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
L330218	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
L330217	u6151	m410	AJAY	I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
L330216	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
L330215	u6151	m410	AJAY	You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
L330214	u6159	m410	ROLAND	That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
L330213	u6151	m410	AJAY	How did you know?
L330383	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
L330382	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
L330302	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
L330301	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there an antidote?
L330254	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
L330253	u6152	m410	EDDIE	It doesn't matter what I think.
L330252	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
L330251	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
L330250	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You are an academic.
L330249	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
L330248	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Minimal is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
L330247	u6152	m410	EDDIE	Minimal.
L330246	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Any damage?
L330197	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
L330196	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm not going, John.
L330194	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
L330193	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John . . .
L330192	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
L330191	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So what?
L330190	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
L330189	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
L330188	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
L330187	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
L330186	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
L330185	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't believe you.
L330184	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
L330183	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What are you talking about?
L330182	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
L330181	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330180	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
L330179	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
L330178	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
L330177	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't know you -- weren't well.
L330176	u6153	m410	HAMMOND	When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
L330175	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Resentful.
L330533	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Everyone, keep your voices down!
L330532	u6158	m410	NICK	Are you looking for a problem?
L330395	u6158	m410	NICK	You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
L330394	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	But he's the head of InGen!
L330390	u6158	m410	NICK	Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
L330389	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
L330337	u6158	m410	NICK	-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
L330336	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
L330304	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	-- my --
L330303	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh --
L330324	u6160	m410	SARAH	We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
L330323	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
L330322	u6160	m410	SARAH	Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
L330321	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
L330320	u6160	m410	SARAH	And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
L330316	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
L330315	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
L330312	u6160	m410	SARAH	Not without a shot of the nest.
L330311	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
L330309	u6154	m410	JUTTSON	I want to see the nesting ground!
L330308	u6160	m410	SARAH	That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
L330710	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Come on!
L330709	u6155	m410	KELLY	Dad!
L330526	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm fine... I'm fine...
L330525	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
L330524	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
L330425	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
L330424	u6155	m410	KELLY	What are you guys gonna do?
L330388	u6155	m410	KELLY	On the side of that one truck.
L330387	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where does it say that?
L330386	u6155	m410	KELLY	InGen.  What's InGen?
L330349	u6155	m410	KELLY	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
L330348	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	How could you possibly?
L330279	u6155	m410	KELLY	You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
L330278	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
L330277	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
L330276	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
L330275	u6155	m410	KELLY	I could come with you.
L330274	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That Richard.
L330273	u6155	m410	KELLY	No.  Richard talked to his parents.
L330272	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, is he?
L330271	u6155	m410	KELLY	That was about a year ago.
L330270	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
L330269	u6155	m410	KELLY	Which one?
L330268	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Is that kid still bothering you?
L330267	u6155	m410	KELLY	No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
L330266	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
L330265	u6155	m410	KELLY	I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
L330264	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
L330263	u6155	m410	KELLY	My vacation is over in a week.
L330262	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
L330261	u6155	m410	KELLY	Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
L330260	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
L330259	u6155	m410	KELLY	I don't even know this woman.
L330258	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
L330256	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Kelly!  What are you doing here?
L330255	u6155	m410	KELLY	Hi, Dad.
L330677	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
L330676	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
L330675	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
L330674	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	It's... behind... us.
L330672	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why?
L330671	u6159	m410	ROLAND	We took to the rock.
L330662	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Possible.
L330661	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
L330650	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good.
L330649	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
L330644	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Operations building.  Far end of the street.
L330643	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Where's the power and radio setup?
L330637	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Piss.
L330636	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What is that?
L330550	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	The velociraptors.
L330549	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What is?
L330450	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Isn't it obvious?
L330449	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What in Christ's name is going on?!
L330443	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
L330442	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You've broken its leg!
L330441	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
L330439	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
L330438	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What?
L330437	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
L330436	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
L330435	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
L330434	u6159	m410	ROLAND	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
L330433	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You rally think this'll draw the parent?
L330431	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
L330430	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
L330429	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	How close do you have to be?
L330428	u6159	m410	ROLAND	My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
L330427	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What kind of gun is that?
L330379	u6159	m410	ROLAND	To collect my fee.
L330378	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Where do you think you're going?!
L330364	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Good lad.
L330363	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Okay.
L330362	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
L330361	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
L330360	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
L330359	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	What?  Why?
L330358	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Cancel that, Dieter.
L330652	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Piss.
L330651	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What's he got in there?
L330210	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
L330209	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
L330208	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
L330207	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
L330206	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You version of it.
L330205	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
L330204	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
L330203	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
L330202	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
L330201	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
L330200	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
L330665	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
L330664	u6160	m410	SARAH	You're going too?
L330663	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	You know how to work a radio, don't you?
L330654	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
L330653	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?
L330537	u6160	m410	SARAH	Oh, God.
L330536	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Their what?
L330529	u6160	m410	SARAH	Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
L330528	u6156	m410	LUDLOW	Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
L330706	u6158	m410	NICK	Look!  Sarah!
L330705	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Something's wrong.
L330701	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
L330700	u6158	m410	NICK	I think she's with Sarah!
L330699	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I have to find Kelly!
L330698	u6158	m410	NICK	Head for the roof!
L330697	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
L330696	u6158	m410	NICK	It'll hold!
L330695	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
L330694	u6158	m410	NICK	"We're sure as hell not going back out there"""
L330693	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We can't stay in here!
L330691	u6158	m410	NICK	She's with Sarah!
L330690	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Where's Kelly?
L330689	u6158	m410	NICK	Come on!
L330648	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't know.
L330647	u6158	m410	NICK	What are they?
L330646	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330645	u6158	m410	NICK	Lava?
L330501	u6158	m410	NICK	No way.
L330500	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.
L330485	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What do you think they want?!
L330484	u6158	m410	NICK	What do they want?!
L330458	u6158	m410	NICK	No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
L330457	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
L330456	u6158	m410	NICK	It has a broken leg!
L330455	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	?!
L330423	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
L330422	u6158	m410	NICK	There' no reason for name calling.
L330420	u6158	m410	NICK	I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
L330419	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Our chance to do what?
L330418	u6158	m410	NICK	Then this is our chance.
L330345	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
L330344	u6158	m410	NICK	Do you see any family resemblance here?
L330326	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, my God.
L330325	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No way.
L330314	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	She's nuts.
L330313	u6158	m410	NICK	She's gutty.
L330667	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
L330666	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
L330631	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
L330630	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Four, counting the one in the chamber.
L330629	u6159	m410	ROLAND	How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
L330577	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
L330576	u6159	m410	ROLAND	"You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, ""why did you go up there to die?""  And he said ""I didn't.  I went up there to live."""
L330575	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	But why?
L330574	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
L330572	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
L330571	u6159	m410	ROLAND	So the truth is more important to you than your life?
L330570	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
L330569	u6159	m410	ROLAND	It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
L330568	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Because it exists.
L330567	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why should they?
L330566	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	So that others would know about this place?
L330565	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Why did you come here?
L330564	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
L330563	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Feeling a bit blue, are we?
L330562	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
L330561	u6159	m410	ROLAND	What's that?
L330560	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
L330556	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
L330555	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
L330554	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
L330686	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Birdshit?
L330685	u6160	m410	SARAH	These formations.  They're dried --
L330684	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	What?
L330683	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian.  It's guano.
L330590	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
L330589	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Maybe.  Maybe not.
L330588	u6160	m410	SARAH	You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
L330510	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	They're pushing us over the cliff.
L330509	u6160	m410	SARAH	What?!
L330508	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Oh, God.
L330504	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
L330503	u6160	m410	SARAH	They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
L330502	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
L330492	u6160	m410	SARAH	I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
L330491	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Are you insane?!
L330490	u6160	m410	SARAH	Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
L330487	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
L330486	u6160	m410	SARAH	That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
L330470	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Think fast, Sarah.
L330469	u6160	m410	SARAH	It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
L330468	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	Can you set up?
L330393	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	John Hammond.
L330392	u6160	m410	SARAH	Funded by whom?
L330391	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
L330342	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	I'm her father.
L330341	u6160	m410	SARAH	Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
L330340	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
L330335	u6160	m410	SARAH	What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
L330334	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
L330318	u6157	m410	MALCOLM	That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
L330317	u6160	m410	SARAH	No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
L330712	u6160	m410	SARAH	Where's Ian?
L330711	u6158	m410	NICK	Where's Kelly?
L330621	u6158	m410	NICK	JUMP!
L330620	u6160	m410	SARAH	WHAT ARE YOU-
L330499	u6160	m410	SARAH	No.
L330498	u6158	m410	NICK	"There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One ""no"" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:"
L330479	u6158	m410	NICK	I'm trying!
L330478	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hold it down, Nick!
L330474	u6160	m410	SARAH	We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
L330473	u6158	m410	NICK	Give it more morphine!
L330467	u6160	m410	SARAH	That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
L330466	u6158	m410	NICK	That little black line?
L330385	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
L330384	u6158	m410	NICK	Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
L330351	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
L330350	u6158	m410	NICK	The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
L330328	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, no!
L330327	u6160	m410	SARAH	-- way we could safely --
L330293	u6160	m410	SARAH	I believe in him.
L330292	u6158	m410	NICK	He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
L330291	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ian's a very good friend of mine.
L330290	u6158	m410	NICK	Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
L330289	u6160	m410	SARAH	You think this is all a joke?
L330288	u6158	m410	NICK	Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
L330287	u6160	m410	SARAH	Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
L330286	u6158	m410	NICK	Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
L330285	u6160	m410	SARAH	That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
L330284	u6158	m410	NICK	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
L330283	u6160	m410	SARAH	So what's your story, Nick?
L330660	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
L330659	u6160	m410	SARAH	You've got to be kidding.
L330633	u6159	m410	ROLAND	Can the kid walk?
L330632	u6160	m410	SARAH	Ask her.
L330600	u6159	m410	ROLAND	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
L330599	u6160	m410	SARAH	We have to send someone to look for him!
L330543	u6160	m410	SARAH	Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
L330542	u6159	m410	ROLAND	If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
L330541	u6159	m410	ROLAND	None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
L330540	u6160	m410	SARAH	Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
L410762	u6841	m457	3JANE	Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
L410761	u6851	m457	MOLLY	My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
L410760	u6841	m457	3JANE	You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
L410758	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Don't play with me.
L410757	u6841	m457	3JANE	He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
L410756	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Take this off.
L410754	u6841	m457	3JANE	Then we would have talked, you and I.
L410753	u6851	m457	MOLLY	No. I only needed the code from you.
L410752	u6841	m457	3JANE	Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
L410621	u6841	m457	3JANE	Of course.
L410620	u6851	m457	MOLLY	They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
L410619	u6841	m457	3JANE	I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
L410618	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Let me get you another glass of wine.
L410616	u6841	m457	3JANE	I'm fine.
L410615	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
L410796	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Of course...
L410795	u6841	m457	3JANE	What about her?
L410794	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
L410793	u6841	m457	3JANE	You're hurt...
L410742	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
L410741	u6841	m457	3JANE	Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
L410733	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
L410732	u6841	m457	3JANE	She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
L410782	u6845	m457	CASE	No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
L410781	u6842	m457	AEROL	Ghost a steppin' razor...
L410747	u6845	m457	CASE	A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410746	u6842	m457	AEROL	What you lookin' for, mon?
L410728	u6842	m457	AEROL	Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
L410727	u6845	m457	CASE	What the hell is that?
L410717	u6842	m457	AEROL	Straylight. Kitchen dock.
L410716	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
L410672	u6845	m457	CASE	If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
L410671	u6842	m457	AEROL	Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
L410670	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you get us into Straylight?
L410565	u6842	m457	AEROL	The Elders, mon...
L410564	u6845	m457	CASE	What are you doing in here?
L410543	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
L410542	u6851	m457	MOLLY	How's the villa's security?
L410541	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
L410534	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
L410533	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
L410476	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
L410475	u6851	m457	MOLLY	A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
L410234	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
L410233	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's an A.I.
L410229	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
L410228	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Easy...
L410547	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	And how do you suggest I do that?
L410546	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
L410518	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What?
L410517	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
L410516	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
L410510	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
L410509	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
L410508	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
L410502	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Why not?
L410501	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Alright. Let's talk business.
L410607	u6845	m457	CASE	I find out now.
L410606	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
L410600	u6845	m457	CASE	This ain't Bangkok, chief.
L410599	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You've got your orders.
L410597	u6845	m457	CASE	The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
L410596	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What are you talking about?
L410595	u6845	m457	CASE	As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
L410594	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
L410593	u6845	m457	CASE	Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
L410538	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
L410537	u6845	m457	CASE	That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
L410474	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
L410473	u6845	m457	CASE	The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
L410472	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
L410471	u6845	m457	CASE	He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
L410470	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
L410469	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You see the couple up in the balcony?
L410468	u6845	m457	CASE	Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
L410356	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
L410355	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah, well it's working.
L410349	u6845	m457	CASE	Linked?
L410348	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You'll be linked during the entire operation.
L410347	u6845	m457	CASE	That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
L410346	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	"Offworld. The A.I.... this ""Wintermute"" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems."
L410345	u6845	m457	CASE	Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
L410344	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Prepping your trip.
L410343	u6845	m457	CASE	He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
L410342	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What about McCoy?
L410341	u6845	m457	CASE	Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
L410340	u6845	m457	CASE	No, but it traced me.
L410339	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Did you trace it?
L410338	u6845	m457	CASE	Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
L410337	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What's this?
L410333	u6845	m457	CASE	What's he doing to my gear?
L410332	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
L410331	u6845	m457	CASE	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
L410330	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You ran without us.
L410251	u6845	m457	CASE	It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
L410250	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
L410249	u6845	m457	CASE	And then?
L410248	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
L410247	u6845	m457	CASE	Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
L410246	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
L410245	u6845	m457	CASE	What are you talking about?
L410244	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
L410243	u6845	m457	CASE	That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
L410242	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I've arranged for him to work with us.
L410241	u6845	m457	CASE	Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
L410240	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Dixie McCoy
L410239	u6845	m457	CASE	I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
L410238	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	It hasn't yet.
L410237	u6845	m457	CASE	Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
L410236	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
L410235	u6845	m457	CASE	First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
L410232	u6845	m457	CASE	Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
L410231	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
L410230	u6845	m457	CASE	Why'd you do it, Armitage?
L410227	u6845	m457	CASE	You son of a bitch...
L410226	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
L410225	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Good, because you've got a new one.
L410224	u6845	m457	CASE	Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
L410223	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
L410222	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
L410221	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
L410177	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
L410176	u6845	m457	CASE	Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
L410175	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
L410174	u6845	m457	CASE	It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
L410173	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
L410172	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
L410171	u6845	m457	CASE	I'd say you were full of shit.
L410170	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
L410169	u6845	m457	CASE	My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
L410168	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
L410167	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
L410166	u6845	m457	CASE	Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
L410165	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
L410164	u6845	m457	CASE	What does this have to do with me?
L410163	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
L410160	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Very well.
L410159	u6845	m457	CASE	You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
L410158	u6843	m457	ARMITAGE	Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
L410712	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
L410711	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
L410710	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
L410709	u6845	m457	CASE	What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
L410708	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
L410707	u6845	m457	CASE	The access code to your mainframe.
L410706	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	The words?
L410705	u6845	m457	CASE	Tell me the words.
L410703	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
L410702	u6845	m457	CASE	Are you even really alive?
L410701	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	"You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote ""Wintermute""."
L410698	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
L410697	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you read my mind?
L410696	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
L410695	u6845	m457	CASE	I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
L410694	u6844	m457	BAO/WINTERMUTE	An odd selection, Mr Case.
L410105	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah.
L410104	u6852	m457	RATZ	Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
L410103	u6845	m457	CASE	You're pleasant tonight.
L410102	u6852	m457	RATZ	Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
L410101	u6852	m457	RATZ	No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
L410100	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't have a girl.
L410099	u6852	m457	RATZ	I saw your girl yesterday.
L410095	u6845	m457	CASE	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
L410094	u6852	m457	RATZ	Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
L410306	u6845	m457	CASE	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
L410305	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
L410304	u6845	m457	CASE	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
L410303	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
L410302	u6845	m457	CASE	That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
L410301	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
L410300	u6845	m457	CASE	As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
L410299	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
L410298	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah. That was me.
L410297	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
L410296	u6845	m457	CASE	Fine, Dixie. Fine.
L410295	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
L410294	u6845	m457	CASE	It's Case. Remember me?
L410293	u6850	m457	MCCOY	Hey, bro.
L410906	u6845	m457	CASE	Maybe so...
L410905	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Jah guides us.
L410904	u6845	m457	CASE	Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
L410902	u6845	m457	CASE	We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
L410901	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
L410900	u6845	m457	CASE	Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
L410895	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
L410894	u6845	m457	CASE	Ready?
L410890	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you walk?
L410889	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Four men. Babylon soldiers.
L410787	u6845	m457	CASE	The girl 3Jane. We need her.
L410786	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
L410766	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	This place empty as a tomb, mon.
L410765	u6845	m457	CASE	We're doing fine. Take the next right.
L410674	u6845	m457	CASE	I an' I, man. I an' I.
L410673	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
L410613	u6845	m457	CASE	Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
L410612	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	All things possible in Babylon.
L410611	u6845	m457	CASE	Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
L410610	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
L410609	u6845	m457	CASE	She's ready to go.
L410572	u6849	m457	MAELCOM	Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
L410571	u6845	m457	CASE	What elders?
L410858	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
L410857	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the route to the core?
L410848	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
L410847	u6845	m457	CASE	Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
L410846	u6846	m457	DIXIE	This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
L410845	u6845	m457	CASE	I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
L410844	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You haven't got it?
L410843	u6845	m457	CASE	It's coming.
L410842	u6846	m457	DIXIE	One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
L410841	u6845	m457	CASE	How's the ice?
L410840	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You're late.
L410779	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
L410778	u6845	m457	CASE	Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
L410777	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
L410776	u6845	m457	CASE	Less than thirty minutes.
L410775	u6846	m457	DIXIE	How much time you got left?
L410774	u6845	m457	CASE	Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
L410773	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
L410772	u6845	m457	CASE	How long, Dixie?
L410771	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
L410770	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
L410769	u6845	m457	CASE	How's the ice break?
L410768	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yo.
L410685	u6845	m457	CASE	Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
L410684	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It'll flatline your ass.
L410682	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
L410681	u6846	m457	DIXIE	What are you talkin' about?
L410680	u6845	m457	CASE	You can make your move when it comes after me.
L410679	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
L410678	u6845	m457	CASE	We run. You crack the pattern?
L410677	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
L410676	u6845	m457	CASE	We got problems topside.
L410675	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Where the hell have you been?
L410562	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
L410561	u6845	m457	CASE	The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
L410560	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
L410559	u6845	m457	CASE	No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
L410558	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
L410557	u6845	m457	CASE	So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
L410556	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
L410555	u6845	m457	CASE	Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
L410554	u6846	m457	DIXIE	He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
L410553	u6846	m457	DIXIE	That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
L410552	u6845	m457	CASE	Bright enough to be dangerous.
L410551	u6846	m457	DIXIE	It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
L410550	u6845	m457	CASE	It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
L410431	u6846	m457	DIXIE	You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
L410430	u6845	m457	CASE	I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
L410429	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
L410428	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
L410427	u6845	m457	CASE	Can you take me to it?
L410426	u6846	m457	DIXIE	That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
L410425	u6845	m457	CASE	How are we doing?
L410424	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Yo.
L410383	u6846	m457	DIXIE	When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
L410382	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410381	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
L410380	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
L410379	u6846	m457	DIXIE	No problem, amigo.
L410378	u6845	m457	CASE	I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
L410377	u6845	m457	CASE	Nobody has.

L410374	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Who got you into this?
L410373	u6845	m457	CASE	I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
L410372	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
L410316	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410315	u6846	m457	DIXIE	Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
L410314	u6845	m457	CASE	You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
L410313	u6846	m457	DIXIE	I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
L410312	u6845	m457	CASE	Right...
L410311	u6846	m457	DIXIE	What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
L410810	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	No!... No...
L410809	u6845	m457	CASE	Want to fucking answer them?
L410807	u6845	m457	CASE	The angels... I think they're calling your name.
L410806	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What?
L410805	u6845	m457	CASE	Wait... You hear that?
L410545	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
L410544	u6845	m457	CASE	What about the mainframe's access code?
L410498	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
L410497	u6845	m457	CASE	Case.
L410496	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...

L410876	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Case... are you okay?
L410114	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
L410113	u6845	m457	CASE	Where did you here that?
L410112	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
L410111	u6845	m457	CASE	I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
L410110	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
L410109	u6845	m457	CASE	Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
L410108	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
L410107	u6845	m457	CASE	I thought you already left.
L410106	u6848	m457	LINDA LEE	Hello, Case.
L410455	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
L410454	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
L410452	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
L410451	u6845	m457	CASE	I think you're full of shit.
L410450	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
L410449	u6845	m457	CASE	Why would you want me to kill you?
L410448	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	"I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My ""ice"" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible."
L410447	u6845	m457	CASE	Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
L410446	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
L410445	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
L410444	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
L410443	u6845	m457	CASE	And Linda...
L410442	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	I had to limit your options.
L410441	u6845	m457	CASE	You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
L410440	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	And we really do have to talk.
L410439	u6847	m457	JULIUS/WINTERMUTE	There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
L410438	u6845	m457	CASE	I know who you are.
L410831	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Hold on.
L410830	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm still going in.
L410829	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You're out of time, man.
L410828	u6845	m457	CASE	Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
L410827	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it?
L410826	u6845	m457	CASE	Shit...
L410821	u6845	m457	CASE	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
L410820	u6851	m457	MOLLY	My God... these people are insane.
L410818	u6845	m457	CASE	No we don't...
L410817	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We've still got to find the mainframe.
L410816	u6845	m457	CASE	Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
L410815	u6851	m457	MOLLY	...And if I guess wrong?
L410814	u6845	m457	CASE	The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
L410812	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
L410811	u6845	m457	CASE	Is he going to make it?
L410530	u6845	m457	CASE	No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
L410529	u6851	m457	MOLLY	When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
L410528	u6845	m457	CASE	I know you have. C'mere.
L410527	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
L410525	u6845	m457	CASE	What went down between you and Riviera?
L410524	u6851	m457	MOLLY	I know.
L410483	u6851	m457	MOLLY	For Peter, that's a short trip.
L410482	u6845	m457	CASE	That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
L410481	u6851	m457	MOLLY	He projects with neural implants.
L410466	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
L410465	u6845	m457	CASE	Something exotic I hope.
L410464	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
L410460	u6851	m457	MOLLY	So... did you get a look at heaven?
L410459	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll be okay.
L410458	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
L410457	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
L410456	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Case... Are you alright?
L410418	u6845	m457	CASE	Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
L410417	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's wrong? Don't like flying?
L410410	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Give me five minutes.
L410409	u6845	m457	CASE	Yeah... fine.
L410407	u6845	m457	CASE	They'll cut you down.
L410406	u6851	m457	MOLLY	I'll get the car.
L410402	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Yeah.
L410401	u6845	m457	CASE	I don't sleep much. You packed?
L410400	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Case... it's four a.m.
L410396	u6845	m457	CASE	Shhh...
L410395	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Case...
L410394	u6845	m457	CASE	...Feels like you.
L410393	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Put the gun down, Case.
L410392	u6845	m457	CASE	It sounds like you.
L410391	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
L410390	u6845	m457	CASE	Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
L410325	u6845	m457	CASE	...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
L410324	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You okay?
L410273	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
L410272	u6845	m457	CASE	The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
L410271	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Dixie McCoy didn't.
L410270	u6845	m457	CASE	Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
L410269	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Won't that mean you're dead?
L410268	u6845	m457	CASE	The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
L410266	u6845	m457	CASE	Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
L410265	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Too late?
L410264	u6845	m457	CASE	Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
L410263	u6851	m457	MOLLY	A regular Fagan.
L410262	u6845	m457	CASE	When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
L410261	u6851	m457	MOLLY	So you're a wire junkie.
L410260	u6845	m457	CASE	On a good run... yeah.
L410259	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
L410258	u6845	m457	CASE	I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
L410257	u6851	m457	MOLLY	If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
L410256	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
L410255	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You're not ready yet. They said two days.
L410254	u6845	m457	CASE	I'm going in.
L410217	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Go ahead...
L410216	u6845	m457	CASE	What the fuck... are you serious?
L410215	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
L410214	u6845	m457	CASE	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
L410213	u6851	m457	MOLLY	That's not going to help.
L410212	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Couple of days. They'll examine you.
L410211	u6845	m457	CASE	How soon is soon enough?
L410210	u6851	m457	MOLLY	We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
L410209	u6845	m457	CASE	I gotta know... did it work>
L410208	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Almost two days.
L410207	u6845	m457	CASE	How long have I been out?
L410206	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
L410205	u6845	m457	CASE	Holy shit...
L410199	u6845	m457	CASE	What?
L410198	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You've been calling her name.
L410189	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What's that supposed to mean?
L410188	u6845	m457	CASE	Maybe something's onto him.
L410187	u6851	m457	MOLLY	I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
L410186	u6845	m457	CASE	Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
L410185	u6851	m457	MOLLY	For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
L410184	u6845	m457	CASE	What about before that?
L410183	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Couple of months.
L410182	u6845	m457	CASE	He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
L410181	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
L410180	u6845	m457	CASE	Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
L410150	u6845	m457	CASE	Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
L410149	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
L410148	u6845	m457	CASE	... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
L410147	u6851	m457	MOLLY	What is it?
L410145	u6851	m457	MOLLY	You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
L410144	u6845	m457	CASE	What's my end?
L410143	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
L410142	u6845	m457	CASE	Why should I want to meet him.
L410141	u6851	m457	MOLLY	His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
L410851	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Shut up.
L410850	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What the fuck kind of questions are those?
L410835	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What are you talking about?
L410834	u6851	m457	MOLLY	How are you at riddles, Peter?
L410833	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	What?
L410832	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Get up.
L410739	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
L410738	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Like what?
L410737	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
L410736	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Who?
L410735	u6853	m457	RIVIERA	Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
L410734	u6851	m457	MOLLY	Peter... What do you think you're doing?

L415045	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	He's conducting experiments of his own.
L415044	u6872	m459	SALLY	When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.

L414992	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
L414990	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
L414989	u6872	m459	SALLY	But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
L414987	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
L414986	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
L414985	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Why not?
L414984	u6872	m459	SALLY	No.
L414983	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Taste it.
L414982	u6872	m459	SALLY	But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
L414981	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Taste it.
L414980	u6872	m459	SALLY	Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
L414979	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
L414974	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Good.  I'm hungry.
L414973	u6872	m459	SALLY	Coming...
L414933	u6872	m459	SALLY	Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
L414932	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Just what?
L414931	u6872	m459	SALLY	That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
L414930	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
L414929	u6872	m459	SALLY	I know.
L414928	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
L414927	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
L414926	u6872	m459	SALLY	I can't help it.
L414925	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
L414924	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
L414923	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	If you went away, what would become of me?
L414922	u6872	m459	SALLY	I know.
L414921	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	You're mine, you know.  I made you.
L414919	u6872	m459	SALLY	Yes.
L414918	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
L414917	u6872	m459	SALLY	Yes.
L414916	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	For this.
L414915	u6872	m459	SALLY	Yes.
L414890	u6872	m459	SALLY	No!
L414889	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....

L415075	u6871	m459	LOCK	We're here!  You sent for us!
L443797	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
L443796	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Seal the cave?
L443713	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No sir, I haven't forgotten.
L443712	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
L443711	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
L443702	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
L443701	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	I apologize.
L443700	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
L443699	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
L443678	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
L443677	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
L443676	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
L443674	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
L443673	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	How did you know we'd come here?
L443520	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
L443519	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
L443377	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
L443376	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
L443375	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
L443374	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
L443373	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Dr. Zaius --
L443319	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
L443318	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
L443774	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Good luck then.
L443773	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
L443751	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
L443750	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
L443718	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
L443717	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	What are you doing there?
L443716	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
L443685	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
L443684	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Taylor, I'd rather you -
L443670	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Shut up.
L443669	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
L443668	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
L443662	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Right now, if you like.
L443661	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
L443651	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
L443650	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
L443647	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
L443646	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Where does the river lead?
L443625	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
L443624	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
L443623	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
L443622	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
L443621	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You still don't believe me, do you?
L443620	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
L443617	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
L443616	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	As you wish.
L443613	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Just the same, I want one.
L443612	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	The best. But we won't need them.
L443611	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Do you have any weapons?
L443610	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
L443631	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
L443630	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
L443607	u7074	m473	ZIRA	There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
L443606	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	How did it go?
L443390	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira....
L443389	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
L443372	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
L443371	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
L443370	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
L443369	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Well, maybe they're not.
L443368	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
L443367	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'I am not a missing link.'
L443365	u7074	m473	ZIRA	How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
L443364	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
L443363	u7074	m473	ZIRA	You didn't think so then.
L443362	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	The evidence was very meager --
L443361	u7074	m473	ZIRA	-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
L443360	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's probably wrong --
L443359	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
L443358	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No, they won't -
L443357	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
L443356	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
L443355	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
L443354	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	I don't. And I'm not going to try.
L443353	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'Then how do you account for me?,
L443352	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
L443351	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
L443345	u7074	m473	ZIRA	And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
L443344	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Flight is a scientific impossibility.
L443342	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	And they fell out of the sky with you?
L443341	u7074	m473	ZIRA	'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
L443340	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
L443339	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Now, just a minute --
L443335	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Where did you learn to do this?
L443334	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
L443333	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
L443308	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
L443307	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The blood transfusion.
L443306	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Remembers what?
L443305	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Look -- she remembers.
L443304	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
L443303	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	What's so special about him?
L443302	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
L443301	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Neither do I.
L443300	u7074	m473	ZIRA	No.
L443299	u7063	m473	CORNELIUS	Do you have to work tonight?
L443218	u7064	m473	DODGE	Blessed are the vegetarians.
L443217	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
L443191	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Let's find them all.
L443190	u7064	m473	DODGE	Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
L443172	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
L443171	u7064	m473	DODGE	Taylor -- quit riding him.
L443162	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	None at all.
L443161	u7064	m473	DODGE	Any particular reason?
L443160	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That way.
L443159	u7064	m473	DODGE	Which direction?
L443158	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
L443157	u7064	m473	DODGE	No.
L443156	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Any sign of dangerous ionization?
L443155	u7064	m473	DODGE	Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
L443142	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
L443141	u7064	m473	DODGE	But how long is a day?
L443140	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
L443139	u7064	m473	DODGE	Yo!
L443138	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Geiger counter?
L443137	u7064	m473	DODGE	Yo!
L443136	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Got your sensors?
L443245	u7065	m473	GALEN	They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
L443244	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
L443243	u7065	m473	GALEN	Hmph.
L443242	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
L443241	u7065	m473	GALEN	You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
L443240	u7074	m473	ZIRA	What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
L443239	u7065	m473	GALEN	But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
L443234	u7065	m473	GALEN	These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
L443233	u7074	m473	ZIRA	This place is dirty, doctor.
L443230	u7065	m473	GALEN	I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
L443229	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Will he live?
L443228	u7065	m473	GALEN	Him.
L443227	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
L443539	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
L443538	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
L443528	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.
L443527	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection!
L443522	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
L443521	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
L443499	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
L443498	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
L443473	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
L443472	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
L443468	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
L443467	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
L443466	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
L443464	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
L443463	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
L443448	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
L443447	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
L443479	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Show this to the President.
L443478	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
L443477	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
L443476	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
L443475	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
L443474	u7066	m473	HONORIUS	Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
L443331	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Do as I say.
L443330	u7067	m473	JULIUS	He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
L443329	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
L443324	u7067	m473	JULIUS	I'll see.
L443323	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
L443322	u7067	m473	JULIUS	What happened?
L443266	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
L443265	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He's trying to form words.
L443264	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Huh?
L443263	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Did you see that? It's remarkable!
L443261	u7067	m473	JULIUS	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
L443260	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
L443256	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
L443255	u7067	m473	JULIUS	You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
L443252	u7067	m473	JULIUS	No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
L443251	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
L443250	u7067	m473	JULIUS	Good morning, Dr. Zira.
L443220	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
L443219	u7068	m473	LANDON	We got off at the wrong stop.
L443209	u7068	m473	LANDON	Try telling them our names.
L443208	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No cigar.
L443201	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay.
L443200	u7068	m473	LANDON	Can we take a dip?
L443197	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Let's take a look.
L443196	u7068	m473	LANDON	Scarecrows?
L443186	u7068	m473	LANDON	I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
L443185	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	But I'm not prepared to die.
L443184	u7068	m473	LANDON	Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
L443183	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Don't bother
L443182	u7068	m473	LANDON	Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
L443181	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
L443179	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
L443178	u7068	m473	LANDON	Climb off me, will you!
L443177	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
L443175	u7068	m473	LANDON	I'm prepared to die.
L443174	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
L443173	u7068	m473	LANDON	All right --
L443170	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
L443169	u7068	m473	LANDON	If only we could get a fix.
L443154	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
L443153	u7068	m473	LANDON	Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
L443152	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
L443151	u7068	m473	LANDON	long pause) You know it.
L443150	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
L443149	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	By our time.  You've turned gray.
L443148	u7068	m473	LANDON	Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
L443147	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
L443146	u7068	m473	LANDON	You don't seem very cut up about it.
L443145	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Air leak. Died in her sleep.
L443144	u7068	m473	LANDON	Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
L443143	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Landon! Join the expedition.
L443130	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
L443129	u7068	m473	LANDON	Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
L443128	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're here to stay.
L443127	u7068	m473	LANDON	Gone.
L443123	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Forget it. Abandon ship.
L443122	u7068	m473	LANDON	It's no use ... there she goes.
L443118	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	To Earth! That we've landed!
L443117	u7068	m473	LANDON	What signal?
L443116	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Landon! Send a last signal.
L443783	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
L443782	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	What?
L443781	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
L443780	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	I think you're making a mistake.
L443779	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Lucius.
L443762	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
L443761	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
L443738	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Yes, I can do that.
L443737	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
L443736	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	What is it?
L443735	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
L443734	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
L443733	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
L443694	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Relax. You'll see it all later.
L443693	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
L443692	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
L443659	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
L443658	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
L443653	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm for that.
L443652	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Shouldn't we be moving on?
L443585	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Fine. Just let her out.
L443584	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
L443583	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I want her.
L443582	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Zira doesn't want your female.
L443581	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	She comes along too.
L443579	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Come on. Get me out of here.
L443578	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
L443577	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Who are you?
L443640	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	To scare off humans?
L443639	u7074	m473	ZIRA	The Hunt Club.
L443638	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Who put them up?
L443592	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
L443591	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	Gorilla hunters ...
L443588	u7074	m473	ZIRA	All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
L443587	u7069	m473	LUCIUS	He wouldn't leave her.
L443586	u7074	m473	ZIRA	I told you not to bring the other one.
L443446	u7074	m473	ZIRA	At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
L443445	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
L443444	u7074	m473	ZIRA	My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
L443443	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
L443383	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We're -- conducting a new experiment.
L443382	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	Why special?
L443381	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
L443380	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
L443379	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A man, Dr. Maximus.
L443378	u7070	m473	MAXIMUS	What is that?
L443514	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
L443513	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
L443494	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
L443493	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	One is in a museum!
L443462	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
L443461	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
L443460	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
L443459	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My name is Taylor.
L443458	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
L443532	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
L443531	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained.
L443526	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
L443525	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	How so?
L443485	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
L443484	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	This is a joke in very poor taste.
L443483	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
L443482	u7074	m473	ZIRA	"'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."""
L443481	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Read it yourself.
L443480	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
L443471	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
L443470	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Mind your tongue, madame.
L443469	u7074	m473	ZIRA	That?s a lie!
L443454	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
L443453	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
L443442	u7074	m473	ZIRA	By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
L443441	u7071	m473	PRESIDENT	Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
L443790	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
L443789	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
L443788	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
L443787	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
L443786	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
L443785	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
L443769	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
L443768	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
L443766	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
L443765	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then there is another jungle?
L443753	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
L443752	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
L443729	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Cease fire! Withdraw!
L443728	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Tell him to pull back!
L443723	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
L443722	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
L443691	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Okay.Up to the cave.
L443690	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course.
L443689	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
L443688	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Twelve hundred years ago.
L443687	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
L443686	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	What is your proposal?
L443683	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
L443682	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
L443667	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
L443666	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Stop right there.
L443566	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
L443565	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
L443564	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
L443563	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I don't know.
L443562	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
L443561	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
L443560	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
L443559	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then you admit --
L443558	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
L443557	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
L443556	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course.
L443555	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
L443553	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
L443552	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
L443551	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What about it?
L443550	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
L443549	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
L443548	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	You lied. Where is your tribe?
L443547	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
L443546	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
L443545	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
L443544	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	No.
L443543	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
L443542	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What about me?
L443505	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Identify him, then. Speak to him.
L443504	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	With one of them.
L443503	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
L443778	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	God bless you.
L443777	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
L443776	u7074	m473	ZIRA	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
L443775	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
L443772	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's better than going to prison for heresy.
L443771	u7074	m473	ZIRA	We can't.
L443770	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Would you like to come along?
L443749	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
L443748	u7074	m473	ZIRA	It's humiliating.
L443747	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Why not?
L443746	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
L443742	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, you can't.
L443741	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
L443710	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
L443709	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor! Tell him.
L443681	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
L443680	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor, please --
L443679	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
L443655	u7074	m473	ZIRA	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
L443654	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
L443637	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
L443636	u7074	m473	ZIRA	You want her that much?
L443635	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Maybe not.
L443634	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
L443633	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Yes.
L443632	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Are you going to take her with you?
L443619	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
L443618	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
L443590	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
L443589	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Listen-
L443510	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
L443509	u7074	m473	ZIRA	No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
L443508	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	You! ... You knew about this?
L443502	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Second from the left.
L443501	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Which one?
L443500	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	It's him...Landon.
L443436	u7074	m473	ZIRA	A hearing.
L443435	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	What is this?
L443434	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Shhhh!
L443433	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
L443281	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
L443280	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
L443278	u7074	m473	ZIRA	There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
L443277	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
L443259	u7072	m473	TAYLOR	Listen, listen -- I can speak --
L443258	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
L443799	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
L443798	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But the proof? The doll?
L443764	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
L443763	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
L443706	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	What?
L443705	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But there's the doll, sir.
L443704	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
L443524	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
L443523	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
L443497	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
L443496	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He doesn't know.
L443495	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
L443492	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Where are they now?
L443491	u7074	m473	ZIRA	This is his assertion.
L443490	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
L443489	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Like you, I find it difficult.
L443488	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Do you believe him?
L443487	u7074	m473	ZIRA	I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
L443486	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
L443385	u7074	m473	ZIRA	Yes, Sir.
L443384	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
L443288	u7074	m473	ZIRA	But perhaps he understood --
L443287	u7073	m473	ZAIUS	Of course. He saw you moving yours.
L443286	u7074	m473	ZIRA	He's moving his fingers!
L470995	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	So what's your next move, Valiant?
L470994	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Well, I'll be...
L470993	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
L470981	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
L470980	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Oh, a ladies man, huh?
L470973	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah...
L470972	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You serve martinis, doncha?
L470971	u7288	m492	DOLORES	We don't serve formula. Snookums.
L470992	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
L470991	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
L470988	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
L470987	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it then?
L470986	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
L470983	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
L470982	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
L470978	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
L470977	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
L470976	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
L470975	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
L470974	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
L470863	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
L470862	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
L470861	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
L470860	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Shoulda guessed.
L470859	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
L470858	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
L470857	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
L470856	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
L470855	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
L470788	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
L470787	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
L470786	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
L470785	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
L470783	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
L470782	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A tweeting bird?
L470781	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	What's this, Roger?
L471319	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
L471318	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
L471317	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
L471316	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
L471315	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
L471314	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'll bet.
L471313	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
L471208	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, no...
L471207	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Sounds like singin'.
L471206	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's that comin' from the bar?
L471205	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
L471204	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
L471203	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
L471202	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon, right?
L471201	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
L471200	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
L471199	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
L471198	u7295	m492	VALIANT	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
L471197	u7288	m492	DOLORES	What was <u>that</u>?
L471083	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
L471082	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
L471079	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
L471078	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
L471073	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
L471072	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So what's the scam, Eddie?
L471066	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
L471065	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
L471057	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
L471056	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you decided to help him after all?
L471055	u7288	m492	DOLORES	It's all yours.
L471054	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
L471053	u7288	m492	DOLORES	He's a riot.
L471048	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
L471047	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
L470998	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's a Toon... who cares?
L470997	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
L470990	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
L470989	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
L470985	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L470984	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
L470969	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
L470968	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Do you think the rabbit did it?
L470962	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Bastards put him on notice.
L470961	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
L470960	u7288	m492	DOLORES	A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
L470957	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
L470956	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
L470835	u7288	m492	DOLORES	R.K. Maroon.
L470834	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Check the scrawl.
L470833	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Is this paper even good?
L470832	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
L470831	u7288	m492	DOLORES	This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
L470830	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
L470829	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
L471487	u7289	m492	DOOM	That's right, me.
L471486	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You?
L471483	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
L471482	u7289	m492	DOOM	Surprised?
L471481	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
L471447	u7289	m492	DOOM	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
L471446	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
L471445	u7289	m492	DOOM	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
L471444	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell's a freeway?
L471443	u7289	m492	DOOM	Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
L471441	u7289	m492	DOOM	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
L471440	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
L471427	u7289	m492	DOOM	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
L471426	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
L471425	u7289	m492	DOOM	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
L471424	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So you're Cloverleaf?
L471423	u7289	m492	DOOM	No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
L471411	u7289	m492	DOOM	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
L471410	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
L471409	u7289	m492	DOOM	These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
L471258	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
L471257	u7289	m492	DOOM	Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
L471253	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
L471252	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
L471145	u7289	m492	DOOM	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
L471144	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
L471143	u7289	m492	DOOM	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
L471142	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
L471141	u7289	m492	DOOM	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
L471140	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
L471139	u7289	m492	DOOM	Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
L471138	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
L471137	u7289	m492	DOOM	They?
L471136	u7295	m492	VALIANT	They must've taken it off me.
L471132	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
L471131	u7289	m492	DOOM	Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
L471128	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Ask her...
L471127	u7289	m492	DOOM	Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
L470933	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
L470932	u7289	m492	DOOM	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
L470931	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
L470930	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
L470929	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
L470925	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
L470924	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
L470923	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
L471160	u7290	m492	EARL	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
L471159	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
L471158	u7290	m492	EARL	Does it hurt?
L471157	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No...
L471156	u7290	m492	EARL	You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
L471155	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What am I, Earl?
L471154	u7290	m492	EARL	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
L471153	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Toon cops worked me over.
L471152	u7290	m492	EARL	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
L471151	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
L471150	u7290	m492	EARL	Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
L471406	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Eddie, come on.
L471405	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hold on a second.
L471397	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	He made me laugh.
L471396	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
L471395	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
L471394	u7295	m492	VALIANT	A joker to the end.
L471393	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
L471392	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it?
L471391	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
L471390	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How did you get onto Doom?
L471387	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's right here in the...
L471386	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Where is he?
L471385	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
L471384	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I didn't know who I could trust.
L471383	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why didn't you tell me?
L471382	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
L471379	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
L471378	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
L471377	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
L471376	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You shot Roger.
L471187	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
L471186	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
L471185	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
L471184	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So altruistic.
L471182	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
L471181	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
L471180	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
L471179	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
L471178	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
L471177	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	No, no, no... I love my husband.
L471176	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
L471175	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
L471174	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
L471173	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Toons aren't given imperfections.
L471172	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
L471170	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
L471169	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
L471168	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's because I don't have a doorbell.
L471167	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
L471130	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
L471129	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
L471493	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
L471492	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Doom.
L471491	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	What the hell is that?
L470951	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
L470950	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's with the dip?
L470940	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
L470939	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
L470910	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Wait here...
L470909	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What a gasser.
L470908	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
L470906	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
L470905	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Now what?
L470903	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what you woke me up for?
L470902	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
L471349	u7293	m492	MAROON	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
L471348	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Take it easy.
L471347	u7293	m492	MAROON	You tricked me, damn you!
L471346	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, I don't.
L471345	u7293	m492	MAROON	You got the will in there, don't ya?
L471343	u7293	m492	MAROON	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
L471342	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
L471341	u7293	m492	MAROON	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
L471340	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
L471339	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That was the idea.
L471338	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant!  You surprised me.
L471324	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stop what?
L471323	u7293	m492	MAROON	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
L471322	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe.  Why?
L471321	u7293	m492	MAROON	Have you got the will?
L471320	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
L471099	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
L471098	u7293	m492	MAROON	I've already seen your photographs.
L471097	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
L471096	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
L471095	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
L470894	u7293	m492	MAROON	Sure, Valiant, sure...
L470893	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
L470888	u7293	m492	MAROON	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
L470887	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
L470820	u7295	m492	VALIANT	As soon as is humanly possible.
L470819	u7293	m492	MAROON	When will I hear from you?
L470818	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aren't you the lucky one...
L470817	u7293	m492	MAROON	I got him on loan from Disney.
L470813	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So's the job.
L470812	u7293	m492	MAROON	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
L470811	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
L470810	u7293	m492	MAROON	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
L470809	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't work in Toontown.
L470808	u7293	m492	MAROON	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
L470807	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So what do you want me to do?
L470806	u7293	m492	MAROON	"Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up."
L470805	u7293	m492	MAROON	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
L470804	u7295	m492	VALIANT	One too many safes dropped on his head?
L470803	u7293	m492	MAROON	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
L470802	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
L470801	u7293	m492	MAROON	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
L470795	u7293	m492	MAROON	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
L470794	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
L470793	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
L471518	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	From this box here...
L471517	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
L471516	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only time will tell.
L471515	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
L471514	u7295	m492	VALIANT	By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
L471512	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
L471511	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, kid, you're a real hero.
L471508	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
L471507	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Keep reading...
L471505	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Good idea.
L471504	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you oughta read it to her.
L471503	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471502	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
L471498	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah...
L471497	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
L471496	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
L471456	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
L471455	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
L471369	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
L471368	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin' in there?
L471335	u7295	m492	VALIANT	... I'd head for Cucamonga.
L471334	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471333	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I don't make it back here by ten...
L471332	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I rest my case.
L471331	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Two bits.
L471330	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
L471329	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
L471328	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Forget it.
L471327	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
L471326	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
L471325	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
L471311	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, it's not.
L471310	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Wrong number?
L471309	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Get away from there.
L471308	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I'll get it.
L471307	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
L471306	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Safe?
L471305	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
L471304	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
L471303	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
L471302	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A Toon?  Noooo.
L471301	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
L471300	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
L471299	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
L471296	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What is this, Twenty Questions?
L471295	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
L471294	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Me.
L471293	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Say, who's this guy laughin'?
L471291	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We can't do anything till it's dark.
L471290	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
L471289	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My brother.  Get inside.
L471288	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
L471264	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
L471263	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
L471261	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
L471260	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
L471259	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
L471256	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
L471255	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
L471254	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
L471225	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
L471224	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
L471223	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
L471222	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
L471221	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
L471220	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
L471219	u7295	m492	VALIANT	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
L471218	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
L471217	u7295	m492	VALIANT	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
L471216	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
L471215	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
L471214	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, don't I get an encore?
L471081	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
L471080	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
L471077	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
L471076	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	How do you know that?
L471075	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
L471074	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	The habeus corpus is thickening.
L471071	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
L471070	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
L471069	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
L471064	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
L471063	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
L471062	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
L471061	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
L471060	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
L471059	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, that's better.
L471058	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Does this help?
L471039	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't ever forget that.
L471038	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
L471037	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
L471034	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
L471033	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
L471019	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
L471018	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
L471017	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
L471016	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
L471008	u7295	m492	VALIANT	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
L471007	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
L471006	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
L471005	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
L471004	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
L471003	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
L471002	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin'?
L471001	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Aah!
L471000	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aah!
L470897	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Divorce?  Never!
L470896	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
L470882	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
L470881	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Pattycake!  Pattycake!
L525108	u7752	m525	BIG THING	Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

L524228	u7753	m525	CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES	Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-

L524137	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	I hate the environment.
L524136	u7763	m525	MR. GARRISON	That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
L524135	u7763	m525	MR. GARRISON	Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.

L524752	u7761	m525	KYLE	Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
L524748	u7761	m525	KYLE	I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
L524747	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	Come on, just get to the message board!
L524710	u7761	m525	KYLE	And she's getting worse...

L524245	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
L524244	u7761	m525	KYLE	Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
L524185	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

L524066	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
L524051	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
L524050	u7761	m525	KYLE	Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
L524049	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.

L524482	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
L524433	u7754	m525	CARTMAN	God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
L524432	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Mkay.
L524418	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.

The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
L524670	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
L524669	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
L524668	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Huh?
L524667	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What about air strikes?
L524666	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
L524665	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
L525197	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh God... What have I done...
L525196	u7769	m525	SATAN	SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
L525195	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
L525194	u7769	m525	SATAN	Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
L525191	u7769	m525	SATAN	YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
L525190	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh.
L525189	u7769	m525	SATAN	SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
L525188	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
L525187	u7769	m525	SATAN	I am the dark master!
L525186	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What the hell is going on?!
L525185	u7769	m525	SATAN	You're all part of Satan's army now!
L524202	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
L524201	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	But I-
L524200	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
L524199	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
L524198	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
L524197	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
L524196	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	We must take action on this immediately.
L524191	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
L524190	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
L524189	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	What is Terrance and Phillip?
L524188	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
L524178	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
L524177	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	The F word?!
L524176	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	No, it was worse than that...
L524175	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
L524497	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Alright, I'll make the call...
L524496	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
L524495	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
L524494	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
L524493	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
L524492	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
L524491	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
L524490	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	How is the children's progress?
L524431	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
L524430	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Uh, we're just, starting our program...
L525246	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
L525245	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
L525162	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Terrance! NO!
L525161	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	AGH!
L525158	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	You did? Just now?
L525157	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
L525121	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Canada is saving us!!
L525120	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	What's going on Terrance?
L525063	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	I know, Terrance. I know.
L525062	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
L525058	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
L525057	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
L524478	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	You would know, dummy.
L524477	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Oh, you are such a maroon!
L524452	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
L524451	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
L524446	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Don't believe the hype!!
L524445	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
L524444	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Fight the power!
L524347	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
L524346	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
L524345	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
L524333	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Cheers, Terrance!
L524332	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
L524325	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Hello, Brooke Shields!
L524324	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Hello, Conan!
L524241	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	I sure did, Phillip!!
L524240	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
L524239	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	You bet, Terrance!
L524238	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
L524237	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
L524236	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
L524088	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
L524087	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
L524086	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	YOU'D fuck your uncle!
L524085	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	You'd fuck your uncle!
L524079	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
L524078	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
L524077	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	It's from your mother.
L524076	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
L524075	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
L524073	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Oh yeah!

L524071	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
L525241	u7769	m525	SATAN	THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
L525240	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
L525238	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.

L525235	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
L525234	u7769	m525	SATAN	If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
L525233	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
L525232	u7769	m525	SATAN	Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
L525210	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?

L524692	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.

L524682	u7769	m525	SATAN	It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
L524677	u7769	m525	SATAN	I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
L524676	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
L524564	u7769	m525	SATAN	I am.
L524563	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Who's my cream puff?

L524559	u7769	m525	SATAN	I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
L524554	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.

L621471	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
L621470	u8534	m579	ANDY	I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
L621469	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay...
L621468	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
L621467	u8534	m579	ANDY	But Mom, I can't find him!
L621466	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
L621464	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	No, I haven't seen him.
L621463	u8534	m579	ANDY	Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
L621422	u8534	m579	ANDY	Just one?
L621421	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	You can bring ONE toy...
L621420	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can I bring some toys?
L621418	u8534	m579	ANDY	Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
L621417	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
L621416	u8534	m579	ANDY	To infinity and beyond!
L621271	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, yeah!
L621270	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
L621137	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay.
L621136	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
L621135	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yeah!
L621134	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, sure, we can leave it up.
L621133	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can we leave this up 'til we move?
L621132	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
L621131	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Whadda ya think?
L621130	u8534	m579	ANDY	Wow!  Cool!
L621990	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Mm-hmmmmm.
L621989	u8545	m579	WOODY	Say, isn't that mistletoe?
L621988	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
L621987	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
L621943	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Rocky!  The ramp!
L621942	u8545	m579	WOODY	We're almost there.
L621752	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
L621751	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	What are you doing over there?
L621363	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
L621362	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
L621315	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
L621314	u8545	m579	WOODY	You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
L621175	u8545	m579	WOODY	Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
L621174	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
L621173	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, hey - it was nothing.
L621172	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
L621171	u8545	m579	WOODY	Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
L622000	u8545	m579	WOODY	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
L621999	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
L621974	u8536	m579	BUZZ	We're not aiming for the truck!
L621973	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
L621972	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
L621971	u8536	m579	BUZZ	This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
L621970	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
L621968	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Not today!
L621967	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
L621962	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
L621961	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha-ha!!
L621960	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hold still, Buzz!
L621959	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody?!  What are you doing?
L621956	u8545	m579	WOODY	The match!
L621955	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  The rocket!
L621954	u8545	m579	WOODY	Great!
L621935	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look out!!
L621934	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, thanks for the ride.
L621916	u8536	m579	BUZZ	NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
L621915	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
L621914	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hold on, Woody!
L621902	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!
L621901	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
L621878	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's ok.  Everything's under control.
L621877	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What?!
L621876	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shhhhhhh!
L621842	u8545	m579	WOODY	We've got to get out of here...NOW.
L621841	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  It's the moving van.
L621839	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes Sir!
L621838	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
L621837	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
L621832	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
L621831	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But why would Andy want me?
L621830	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
L621829	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yeah, right.
L621828	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
L621827	u8536	m579	BUZZ	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
L621826	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
L621825	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
L621824	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
L621823	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
L621822	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
L621729	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Years of Academy training...wasted!!
L621728	u8545	m579	WOODY	Come on, this way!
L621727	u8545	m579	WOODY	Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
L621726	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
L621725	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
L621724	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
L621723	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Oh, I'm a sham!!
L621719	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
L621718	u8545	m579	WOODY	I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
L621717	u8536	m579	BUZZ	One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
L621716	u8545	m579	WOODY	What happened to you?
L621672	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shhh!
L621671	u8545	m579	WOODY	Don't tell me what to do!
L621670	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
L621667	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
L621666	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, stop it!!
L621665	u8545	m579	WOODY	Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
L621664	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
L621663	u8545	m579	WOODY	Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
L621662	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
L621661	u8536	m579	BUZZ	It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
L621660	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shield your eyes!
L621659	u8545	m579	WOODY	They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
L621658	u8545	m579	WOODY	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
L621657	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, we don't know what's out there!
L621655	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
L621654	u8545	m579	WOODY	I sure hope this isn't permanent.
L621633	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
L621632	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I've set my laser from stun to kill.
L621574	u8545	m579	WOODY	YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
L621573	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
L621555	u8545	m579	WOODY	Alright Buzz, get ready...
L621554	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Spaceship.
L621553	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where is it?  I don't see the --
L621552	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
L621551	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
L621550	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean it has hyperdrive?
L621549	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
L621542	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sorry.
L621541	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ow!  Watch where you're going!
L621524	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
L621523	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
L621522	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Well, then let's climb abroad.
L621521	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
L621520	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
L621516	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Go away.
L621515	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
L621503	u8545	m579	WOODY	WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
L621502	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
L621501	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
L621500	u8536	m579	BUZZ	My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
L621499	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
L621498	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
L621497	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
L621496	u8536	m579	BUZZ	According to my nava-computer, the --
L621487	u8545	m579	WOODY	No.
L621486	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But we're not on my planet, are we?
L621485	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh.  Oh, that's good.
L621484	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
L621483	u8545	m579	WOODY	Right?  Buddy?
L621429	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Then we've no time to lose!!
L621428	u8545	m579	WOODY	Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
L621427	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Trouble?!  Where?!
L621426	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
L621414	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
L621413	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I could have stopped him.
L621401	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean that happy child?
L621400	u8545	m579	WOODY	THAT is Sid!
L621399	u8545	m579	WOODY	No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
L621398	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sure is a hairy fellah.
L621397	u8545	m579	WOODY	That's why.  Sid.
L621396	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
L621395	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I'd better take a look anyway.
L621394	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
L621393	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's going on?
L621379	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where?
L621378	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
L621377	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You're mocking me, aren't you?
L621376	u8545	m579	WOODY	"You actually think you're THE ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!"
L621373	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
L621372	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't even think about it, cowboy!
L621371	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
L621370	u8545	m579	WOODY	And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
L621369	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
L621368	u8545	m579	WOODY	Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
L621346	u8545	m579	WOODY	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
L621345	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
L621340	u8536	m579	BUZZ	All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
L621339	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
L621338	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
L621337	u8545	m579	WOODY	Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
L621336	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Can!
L621335	u8545	m579	WOODY	You can't!
L621334	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yes, I can.
L621333	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, you can't.
L621332	u8536	m579	BUZZ	They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
L621329	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me.
L621328	u8545	m579	WOODY	He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
L621325	u8545	m579	WOODY	The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
L621324	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
L621323	u8545	m579	WOODY	T-O-Y.  Toy.
L621322	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Toy?
L621301	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
L621300	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
L621296	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Watch yourself!!
L621295	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
L621294	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
L621293	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
L621290	u8536	m579	BUZZ	HO-YAAAHH!!!
L621289	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hello-o-o...
L621773	u8545	m579	WOODY	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
L621772	u8537	m579	HAMM	Something's screwy here.
L621742	u8537	m579	HAMM	Everyone, it's Woody!
L621741	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hi!
L621331	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
L621330	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
L621319	u8537	m579	HAMM	What's with him?
L621318	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
L621259	u8545	m579	WOODY	Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
L621258	u8537	m579	HAMM	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
L621257	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
L621199	u8545	m579	WOODY	Stay calm, everyone!!
L621198	u8537	m579	HAMM	Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
L621197	u8545	m579	WOODY	It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
L621779	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Murderer!
L621778	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, that is disgusting.
L621740	u8537	m579	HAMM	He's in the psycho's bedroom!
L621739	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Son of a building block, it's Woody!
L621737	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	How 'bout three out of five?
L621736	u8537	m579	HAMM	No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
L621735	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
L621734	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Are you peeking?

L621446	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
L621388	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
L621387	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Who is it this time?

L621195	u8541	m579	REX	But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
L621194	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
