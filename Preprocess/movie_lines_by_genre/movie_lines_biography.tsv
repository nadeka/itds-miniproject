L2181	u12	m1	ALONSO	Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
L2180	u23	m1	SAILOR	We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
L2179	u12	m1	ALONSO	We should have seen land.
L2177	u23	m1	SAILOR	We'll all go crazy...
L2176	u12	m1	ALONSO	He's the devil's child...
L2175	u12	m1	ALONSO	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
L2174	u23	m1	SAILOR	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
L2173	u12	m1	ALONSO	What are you listening to, chicken ass?
L2172	u12	m1	ALONSO	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
L2171	u23	m1	SAILOR	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
L2170	u12	m1	ALONSO	I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
L2025	u13	m1	AROJAZ	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
L2024	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
L2023	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
L2022	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
L2020	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
L2019	u13	m1	AROJAZ	If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
L2016	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
L2015	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
L2014	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
L2012	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If they agree to follow me, yes.
L2011	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Your life, and that of others!
L2010	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
L2006	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Excellency, you are right.
L2005	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
L1993	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
L1992	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am, Your Eminence
L1991	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
L1990	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
L1989	u13	m1	AROJAZ	You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
L2524	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
L2523	u13	m1	AROJAZ	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
L2522	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You can see for yourself.
L2275	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
L2274	u13	m1	AROJAZ	It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
L2031	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
L2030	u13	m1	AROJAZ	He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
L2029	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
L2028	u13	m1	AROJAZ	The Judgment is ours!
L2027	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
L2540	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
L2539	u14	m1	BEATRIX	What is it, now?  Tell me...
L2538	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I am busy inside.
L2537	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Can't you stay with us a little?
L2474	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
L2473	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They took everything...
L2472	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They tried... but I didn't let them.
L2471	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
L2320	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
L2319	u14	m1	BEATRIX	You don't usually ask.
L2318	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
L2123	u14	m1	BEATRIX	That's something you can't decide.
L2122	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't want you to wait for me.
L2121	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
L2119	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Thank God...
L2118	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	She said yes.
L1986	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I find that hard to believe.
L1985	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
L1984	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
L1983	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Are we going to argue?
L1982	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
L1981	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I haven't given you much of a life.
L1980	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I know.
L1979	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I could be gone for years.
L2432	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
L2431	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
L2430	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
L2429	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How far from here?
L2426	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
L2425	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Viceroy of the West Indies.
L2424	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Appointment to what?
L2423	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	My letters of appointment.
L2422	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... I remember...
L2421	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
L2293	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
L2292	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	May I ask by whom?
L2291	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
L2290	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
L2552	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
L2551	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
L2550	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
L2549	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
L2548	u17	m1	FERNANDO	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
L2547	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What does he say?
L2542	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
L2541	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What are you listening to?
L2501	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
L2500	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Father...
L2485	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Not bad.
L2484	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How are you feeling, Fernando?
L2440	u17	m1	FERNANDO	This time with me!
L2439	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to explore the mainland.
L2131	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
L2130	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
L2129	u17	m1	FERNANDO	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
L2128	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There'll be a time.
L2127	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want to go with you!
L2469	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them created by people like me.
L2468	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
L2467	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you see?
L2466	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Look out of that window.
L2465	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
L2464	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Call them.
L2463	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	All I have to do is call the guards.
L2301	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
L2300	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What...?  Do I have so many already?
L2299	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
L2297	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
L2296	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
L2295	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
L2287	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... for a commoner?
L2286	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You defend yourself admirably...
L2282	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
L2281	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
L2110	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
L2109	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
L2108	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Then you are too ambitious.
L2107	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'm not bargaining!
L2106	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
L2105	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
L2104	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	No?
L2103	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No...
L2410	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You never learned how to speak my language.
L2409	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
L2394	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You did the same to your God!
L2393	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
L2343	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ask him if he will help.
L2342	u25	m1	UTAPAN	He understands.
L2341	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
L2260	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
L2259	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says...
L2258	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... and also to bring medicine.
L2257	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- he has a God.
L2256	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To bring the word of God.
L2255	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Why?
L2254	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thousands.
L2253	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- how many?
L2251	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
L2250	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief knows.
L2249	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell the Chief we thank him.
L2248	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You come!  You speak first!
L2239	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Island.  Far.
L2238	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
L2237	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Say not here!  Cuba!
L2535	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
L2534	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Oh?  So you are a new man?
L2533	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	New worlds create new people.
L2532	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I knew you would.
L2531	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to disagree.
L2526	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll always be older than me, Father.
L2525	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I suppose we're both old men now.
L2145	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Give me absolution.
L2144	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I believed in you...
L2143	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You are bound by an oath, Father.
L2142	u19	m1	MARCHENA	My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
L2141	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
L2140	u19	m1	MARCHENA	May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
L2139	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
L2138	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How long?
L2137	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
L2136	u19	m1	MARCHENA	What are you saying?
L2135	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
L2134	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I am listening, my son.
L2133	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
L2132	u19	m1	MARCHENA	In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
L2046	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!  Don't!
L2045	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them!  Just lies!
L2042	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
L2041	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!
L2040	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn God!
L2039	u19	m1	MARCHENA	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
L2038	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
L2037	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
L1969	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
L1968	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
L1967	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
L1966	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Passion is something one cannot control!
L1965	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Father Marchena!
L1964	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
L1963	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
L1962	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	So was Christ!
L1961	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Esdras is a Jew.
L1960	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
L1959	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?
L1958	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
L1957	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
L1952	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
L1951	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Why do you wish to sail west?
L1950	u19	m1	MARCHENA	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
L1949	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How did you manage it?
L1948	u19	m1	MARCHENA	That's what it says.
L1947	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... That's in a week!
L1943	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
L1942	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
L2459	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
L2458	u18	m1	ISABEL	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
L2457	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thank you.
L2456	u18	m1	ISABEL	But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
L2280	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
L2279	u18	m1	ISABEL	Do they have such thoughts?
L2086	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
L2085	u18	m1	ISABEL	How old are you, Senor Colon?
L2082	u18	m1	ISABEL	A woman?
L2081	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
L2080	u18	m1	ISABEL	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
L2079	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	May I speak freely?
L2077	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Surely you can do anything you want.
L2076	u18	m1	ISABEL	I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
L2075	u18	m1	ISABEL	That she was impregnable.
L2074	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What did they say about Granada before today?
L2073	u18	m1	ISABEL	The ocean is uncrossable?
L2072	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
L2071	u18	m1	ISABEL	I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
L2389	u21	m1	MOXICA	You will regret this.
L2388	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
L2387	u21	m1	MOXICA	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
L2386	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
L2348	u21	m1	MOXICA	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
L2347	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
L2346	u21	m1	MOXICA	My horse doesn't work.
L2345	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We can't raise the wheel without it.
L2333	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
L2332	u21	m1	MOXICA	We don't need to know.
L2331	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
L2329	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
L2328	u21	m1	MOXICA	We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
L2278	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
L2277	u21	m1	MOXICA	And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
L2492	u20	m1	MENDEZ	We can't be.
L2491	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
L2490	u20	m1	MENDEZ	What's he doing?
L2165	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Twenty eight.
L2164	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you read?
L2160	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Come over here.
L2159	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
L2158	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And what do you think Mendez?
L2157	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
L2155	u20	m1	MENDEZ	God be with us admiral.
L2154	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
L2211	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You're right.  Let the men decide.
L2210	u22	m1	PINZON	You tell that to them!
L2209	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
L2208	u22	m1	PINZON	You bloody...
L2207	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
L2206	u22	m1	PINZON	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
L2205	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
L2204	u22	m1	PINZON	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
L2203	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The land is there.  I know it!
L2202	u22	m1	PINZON	We're lost!
L2201	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You think I don't know that?
L2200	u22	m1	PINZON	We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
L2199	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
L2198	u22	m1	PINZON	You must be mad...!
L2197	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Six days ago, yes.
L2196	u22	m1	PINZON	You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
L2065	u22	m1	PINZON	Immediately.
L2064	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Where can I meet this man?

L2418	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	He must be replaced.
L2417	u18	m1	ISABEL	Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
L2415	u18	m1	ISABEL	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
L2414	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
L2377	u18	m1	ISABEL	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
L2376	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
L2116	u18	m1	ISABEL	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!

L30088	u243	m16	ARCO	Indeed.
L30087	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
L30086	u255	m16	MOZART	Certainly!
L30085	u243	m16	ARCO	Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
L30321	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Meaning you didn't like it.
L30320	u260	m16	SALIERI	Extremely clever.
L30319	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	What did you think of the music?

L30313	u260	m16	SALIERI	What?
L30312	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Did you know? Had you heard?
L30251	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.

L30249	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Why?

L30246	u260	m16	SALIERI	Perhaps.
L30245	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
L30244	u260	m16	SALIERI	My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
L30243	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
L30242	u260	m16	SALIERI	A Turkish brothel.
L30241	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Oh!
L30240	u260	m16	SALIERI	A brothel.
L30239	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	What's that?

L30237	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Where?
L30236	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?

L30234	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
L30233	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	How do you know?
L30232	u260	m16	SALIERI	No.
L30231	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Is there a part for me?
L30230	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L30229	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
L30228	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
L30227	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
L30226	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
L30225	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
L30224	u260	m16	SALIERI	Good morning.
L30223	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Maestro.
L30337	u255	m16	MOZART	Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
L30336	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
L30332	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
L30331	u255	m16	MOZART	What??
L30330	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Is she a good fuck?
L30325	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	I'm so relieved.
L30324	u255	m16	MOZART	No, she's fine.
L30323	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
L30322	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh - excuse me!
L30305	u255	m16	MOZART	I'll be right back.
L30304	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Don't bother.
L30303	u255	m16	MOZART	What?
L30302	u244	m16	CAVALIERI	Don't bother!
L30301	u255	m16	MOZART	Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
L30356	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
L30355	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	You have leave to try.
L30354	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
L30353	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	And how will you make him keep it?
L30352	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
L30351	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
L30350	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Sir -
L30349	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
L30348	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
L30347	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Hardly.
L30346	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
L30345	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	No! I won't have him back.
L30102	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
L30101	u255	m16	MOZART	No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
L30100	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
L30099	u255	m16	MOZART	If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
L30098	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
L30097	u255	m16	MOZART	Humiliated?
L30096	u245	m16	COLLOREDO	Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
L30095	u255	m16	MOZART	Why what, sir?

L31324	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
L31323	u260	m16	SALIERI	No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
L31322	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	This is not his handwriting.
L31317	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	And I'm asking you -
L31316	u260	m16	SALIERI	He asked me to stay.
L31315	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
L31314	u260	m16	SALIERI	He needs me, ma'am.
L31313	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
L31312	u260	m16	SALIERI	I was at hand.
L31311	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Why you?
L31310	u260	m16	SALIERI	Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
L31309	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	What are you doing here?
L30482	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
L30481	u260	m16	SALIERI	What?
L30480	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
L30464	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
L30463	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	But! I'm a married woman!
L30462	u260	m16	SALIERI	It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
L30461	u260	m16	SALIERI	Isn't it obvious?
L30460	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	What do you mean?
L30459	u260	m16	SALIERI	Some service deserves service in return. No?
L30458	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	What for?
L30457	u260	m16	SALIERI	Alone.
L30456	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Tonight?
L30455	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come back tonight.
L30454	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh, thank you, sir!
L30453	u260	m16	SALIERI	Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
L30451	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
L30450	u260	m16	SALIERI	It is miraculous.
L30445	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
L30444	u260	m16	SALIERI	These are originals?
L30443	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Yes.
L30442	u260	m16	SALIERI	Originals?
L30441	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
L30440	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
L30439	u260	m16	SALIERI	Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
L30438	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
L30434	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
L30433	u260	m16	SALIERI	I see.
L30432	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	No, sir. This is my own idea.
L30431	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then he didn't send you?
L30430	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
L30429	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really?
L30428	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
L30427	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
L30426	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
L30425	u260	m16	SALIERI	I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
L30424	u260	m16	SALIERI	I understand.
L30423	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	He's terribly busy, sir.
L30422	u260	m16	SALIERI	How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
L30421	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
L30420	u260	m16	SALIERI	Frau Mozart?
L30419	u260	m16	SALIERI	Madame. How can I help you?
L30418	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Excellency!
L31115	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
L31114	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
L31113	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Money! Money!
L31112	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
L31111	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
L31110	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
L31109	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	He's doing his best.
L31108	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
L31107	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Leave him alone!
L31106	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
L31085	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I hope so. I need it immediately.
L31084	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
L31083	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Where's our friend?
L31082	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Not at all.
L31081	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Am I interrupting something?
L31017	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
L31016	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	How much will you pay him?
L30740	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Do you hear him? Do you?
L30739	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
L30738	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
L30737	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
L30736	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
L30723	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
L30722	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
L30721	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
L30659	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	In three months! Papa.
L30658	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	When, may I ask?
L30657	u247	m16	CONSTANZE	Oh, yes.
L30656	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I see that you're expecting.
L30998	u263	m16	SECOND LADY	Behold!
L30997	u248	m16	FIRST LADY	Behold!
L30991	u263	m16	SECOND LADY	Hey!
L30990	u248	m16	FIRST LADY	Hey!
L30976	u263	m16	SECOND LADY	Behold!
L30975	u248	m16	FIRST LADY	Behold!
L30963	u263	m16	SECOND LADY	Adorable!
L30962	u248	m16	FIRST LADY	He's adorable!
L30957	u263	m16	SECOND LADY	Be careful!
L30956	u248	m16	FIRST LADY	Be careful!
L30268	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
L30267	u249	m16	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
L30264	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
L30263	u249	m16	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
L30262	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
L30261	u249	m16	FLUNKY	I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
L30260	u254	m16	MADAME WEBER	Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
L30617	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Yes. He is a little strange.
L30616	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	What a strange young man.
L30606	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Michael!
L30605	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	I said play!
L30582	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
L30581	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
L30580	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
L30579	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Gertrude!
L30578	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
L30575	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	You can't be Herr Mozart!
L30574	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Gertrude!
L30573	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Upstairs.
L30602	u255	m16	MOZART	Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
L30601	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
L30600	u255	m16	MOZART	Who was your teacher?
L30599	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Just one year.
L30589	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Wine?
L30588	u255	m16	MOZART	I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
L30587	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
L30584	u250	m16	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	Ah, now! Here she comes.
L30583	u255	m16	MOZART	Really?
L30889	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, look at them.
L30888	u260	m16	SALIERI	It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
L30887	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Do you like this, Salieri?
L30521	u260	m16	SALIERI	Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
L30520	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes?
L30519	u260	m16	SALIERI	As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
L30518	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Really?
L30517	u260	m16	SALIERI	I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
L30516	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Of course not.
L30515	u260	m16	SALIERI	Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
L30514	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Oh?
L30513	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
L30512	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Why not?
L30511	u260	m16	SALIERI	Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
L30510	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
L30378	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well. There it is.
L30377	u260	m16	SALIERI	Sire.
L30376	u251	m16	JOSEPH	You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
L30375	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
L30374	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
L30373	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
L30372	u251	m16	JOSEPH	And the result satisfies.
L30371	u260	m16	SALIERI	You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
L30370	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes?
L30369	u260	m16	SALIERI	An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
L30368	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
L30367	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
L30365	u260	m16	SALIERI	Your Highness.
L30364	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
L30204	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
L30203	u260	m16	SALIERI	Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
L30202	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, I'm glad to hear that.
L30179	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
L30178	u260	m16	SALIERI	My pleasure.
L30170	u260	m16	SALIERI	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
L30169	u251	m16	JOSEPH	And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
L30156	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha!
L30155	u260	m16	SALIERI	A-flat, Majesty.
L30154	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
L30153	u260	m16	SALIERI	You do me too much honour, Sire.
L30152	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
L30151	u260	m16	SALIERI	Majesty.
L30150	u251	m16	JOSEPH	May I try it?
L30149	u260	m16	SALIERI	It's just a trifle, of course.
L30148	u251	m16	JOSEPH	What a charming idea. May I see?
L30124	u251	m16	JOSEPH	You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
L30123	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
L30833	u255	m16	MOZART	Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
L30832	u251	m16	JOSEPH	You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
L30831	u255	m16	MOZART	Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
L30821	u255	m16	MOZART	Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
L30820	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
L30819	u255	m16	MOZART	Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
L30818	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I have no idea.
L30817	u255	m16	MOZART	But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
L30816	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah, love again.
L30815	u255	m16	MOZART	But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
L30814	u251	m16	JOSEPH	I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
L30813	u255	m16	MOZART	Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
L30812	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
L30809	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
L30808	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Would you tell me why?
L30807	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, yes, I admit it is.
L30806	u251	m16	JOSEPH	It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
L30805	u255	m16	MOZART	Who told you this, Majesty?
L30804	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
L30803	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, Sire.
L30802	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
L30768	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah! By all means.
L30767	u255	m16	MOZART	May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
L30766	u251	m16	JOSEPH	What is it?
L30765	u255	m16	MOZART	Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
L30762	u255	m16	MOZART	Thank you, Sire!
L30761	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
L30296	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
L30295	u255	m16	MOZART	Twenty-six.
L30294	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Excuse me, but how old are you?
L30293	u255	m16	MOZART	Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
L30292	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
L30290	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Enchanted, Madame.
L30289	u255	m16	MOZART	Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
L30285	u255	m16	MOZART	Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
L30284	u251	m16	JOSEPH	My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
L30281	u251	m16	JOSEPH	My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
L30280	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
L30277	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
L30276	u255	m16	MOZART	What do you mean, Sire?
L30275	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
L30274	u255	m16	MOZART	So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
L30273	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
L30272	u255	m16	MOZART	And German?
L30271	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes, indeed.
L30270	u255	m16	MOZART	It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
L30213	u255	m16	MOZART	I think so, Sire, yes.
L30212	u251	m16	JOSEPH	What? On one hearing only?
L30211	u255	m16	MOZART	Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
L30195	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha.
L30194	u255	m16	MOZART	In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
L30193	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes, where?
L30192	u255	m16	MOZART	It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
L30191	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
L30187	u255	m16	MOZART	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
L30186	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Why so?
L30181	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
L30180	u255	m16	MOZART	Majesty!
L30177	u255	m16	MOZART	Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
L30176	u251	m16	JOSEPH	And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
L30168	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
L30167	u251	m16	JOSEPH	The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
L30166	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, thank you.
L30162	u251	m16	JOSEPH	No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
L30161	u255	m16	MOZART	Your Majesty!
L30146	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
L30145	u267	m16	VON STRACK	He's here.
L30144	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Yes, what about him?
L30143	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
L30142	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well, what do you have for me today?
L30126	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Well. There it is.
L30125	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Yes, sir.
L30119	u267	m16	VON STRACK	In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
L30118	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
L30115	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
L30114	u267	m16	VON STRACK	I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
L30113	u251	m16	JOSEPH	Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
L30775	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
L30774	u255	m16	MOZART	Father -
L30735	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	She does. She says I sleep all day.
L30734	u255	m16	MOZART	No one calls you that.
L30733	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
L30732	u255	m16	MOZART	Papa!
L30731	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
L30716	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
L30715	u255	m16	MOZART	Are you playing a trick on me?
L30714	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Mine?
L30713	u255	m16	MOZART	Papa, is this your idea?
L30683	u255	m16	MOZART	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
L30682	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
L30679	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
L30678	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
L30673	u255	m16	MOZART	This is just a game, Papa.
L30672	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	No, really!
L30669	u255	m16	MOZART	Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
L30668	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
L30662	u255	m16	MOZART	Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
L30661	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
L30660	u255	m16	MOZART	Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
L30652	u255	m16	MOZART	It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
L30651	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	You don't have secrets from me.
L30650	u255	m16	MOZART	It's a secret.
L30649	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Why not?
L30648	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, let's not talk about it.
L30647	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	What's that?
L30646	u255	m16	MOZART	This one will.
L30645	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
L30644	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
L30643	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	How many?
L30642	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes.
L30641	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Yes.
L30640	u255	m16	MOZART	Pupils?
L30639	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	How many pupils do you have?
L30638	u255	m16	MOZART	Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
L30637	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	They say you're in debt.
L30636	u255	m16	MOZART	What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
L30635	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	That's not what I hear.
L30634	u255	m16	MOZART	It couldn't be better.
L30633	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	How is your financial situation?
L30632	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
L30631	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Don't you have a maid?
L30630	u255	m16	MOZART	She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
L30627	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
L30626	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Do you always live like this?
L30625	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
L30624	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Is she not here?
L30623	u255	m16	MOZART	Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
L30621	u255	m16	MOZART	Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
L30620	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	Am I not welcome?
L30619	u255	m16	MOZART	Why are you here?
L30359	u255	m16	MOZART	I will.
L30358	u252	m16	LEOPOLD	I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
L31131	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you sure it's an opera?
L31130	u253	m16	LORL	Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
L31129	u260	m16	SALIERI	Opera? Opera!
L31128	u253	m16	LORL	I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
L31127	u260	m16	SALIERI	Is he working?
L31126	u253	m16	LORL	I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
L31125	u260	m16	SALIERI	Is he working?
L31124	u253	m16	LORL	Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
L31123	u260	m16	SALIERI	Where?
L31122	u253	m16	LORL	I don't know. He has pains.
L31121	u260	m16	SALIERI	What medicine?
L31120	u253	m16	LORL	You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
L31119	u260	m16	SALIERI	Why? What has happened?
L31118	u253	m16	LORL	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
L31117	u260	m16	SALIERI	Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
L30760	u253	m16	LORL	In there, sir.
L30759	u260	m16	SALIERI	Where does he work?
L30757	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes what?
L30756	u253	m16	LORL	I think I've found out about the money, sir.
L30754	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
L30753	u253	m16	LORL	Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
L30752	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really? What is it he's writing?
L30751	u253	m16	LORL	Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
L30750	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
L30749	u253	m16	LORL	Not that I've seen.
L30748	u260	m16	SALIERI	Do any pupils come to the house?
L30747	u253	m16	LORL	Oh, thank you, sir.
L30222	u260	m16	SALIERI	Bene.
L30221	u253	m16	LORL	Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
L30135	u260	m16	SALIERI	Bene! Bene!
L30134	u253	m16	LORL	Yes, thank you, sir.
L30133	u260	m16	SALIERI	Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
L30132	u253	m16	LORL	I will, sir.
L30131	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
L30130	u260	m16	SALIERI	What have you got for me today? Let me see.
L30129	u253	m16	LORL	Good morning, sir.
L30128	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
L30712	u253	m16	LORL	Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
L30711	u255	m16	MOZART	Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
L30708	u253	m16	LORL	They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
L30707	u255	m16	MOZART	What?
L30706	u253	m16	LORL	My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
L30705	u255	m16	MOZART	That's right.
L30704	u253	m16	LORL	Are you Herr Mozart?
L30703	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes?
L31104	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	So let me see it. Where is it?
L31103	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, we can.
L31102	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
L31101	u255	m16	MOZART	Because there's nothing to see.
L31100	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Why not?
L31099	u255	m16	MOZART	No.
L31098	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Can I see it?
L31097	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes.
L31096	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
L31095	u255	m16	MOZART	What?
L31094	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
L31093	u255	m16	MOZART	Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
L31092	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	What is this?
L31091	u255	m16	MOZART	Put it down!
L31090	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Wolfi!
L31089	u255	m16	MOZART	Leave that alone!
L31015	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	So there you are. What do you say?
L31014	u255	m16	MOZART	No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
L31013	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
L31012	u255	m16	MOZART	German!
L31011	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
L31010	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
L31009	u255	m16	MOZART	Animals?
L31008	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
L31007	u255	m16	MOZART	I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
L31006	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
L31005	u255	m16	MOZART	I liked the horse.
L31004	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Yes, well, it's all good fun.
L31003	u255	m16	MOZART	Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
L30920	u255	m16	MOZART	That kind of music should be punishable by death.
L30919	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Sublime! Utterly sublime!
L30918	u255	m16	MOZART	Well?
L30681	u255	m16	MOZART	Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
L30680	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	What did he say? What did he say?
L30496	u255	m16	MOZART	Sssh! Stay here.
L30495	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
L30494	u255	m16	MOZART	Sssh!
L31043	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	My answer is no, Mozart.
L31042	u255	m16	MOZART	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
L31041	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	I'm sorry. No.
L31040	u255	m16	MOZART	No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
L31039	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
L31038	u255	m16	MOZART	If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
L31037	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	What for?
L31036	u255	m16	MOZART	Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
L31035	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
L31034	u255	m16	MOZART	Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
L31033	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
L31032	u255	m16	MOZART	Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
L31031	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
L30615	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
L30614	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
L30598	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
L30597	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
L30586	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
L30585	u255	m16	MOZART	Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
L30577	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
L30576	u255	m16	MOZART	I'm afraid I am.
L30572	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
L30571	u255	m16	MOZART	Madame.
L30570	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
L30568	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
L30567	u255	m16	MOZART	And which one of them do you want me to teach?
L30566	u262	m16	SCHLUMBERG	Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
L31308	u255	m16	MOZART	I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
L31307	u260	m16	SALIERI	What for?
L31306	u255	m16	MOZART	I am so ashamed.
L31305	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm not leaving you.
L31304	u255	m16	MOZART	Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
L31303	u260	m16	SALIERI	I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
L31302	u255	m16	MOZART	We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
L31301	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
L31300	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you want to rest a bit?
L31299	u255	m16	MOZART	Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
L31298	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31297	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you have it?
L31296	u260	m16	SALIERI	You go fast!
L31295	u255	m16	MOZART	And that's it. Do you have it?
L31292	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes!
L31291	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, and on 'dictis'.
L31290	u260	m16	SALIERI	Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
L31289	u255	m16	MOZART	C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
L31288	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
L31287	u260	m16	SALIERI	That's wonderful!
L31285	u255	m16	MOZART	Show me.
L31284	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think so.
L31283	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you have me?
L31281	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
L31280	u260	m16	SALIERI	And that's all?
L31279	u255	m16	MOZART	Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
L31278	u260	m16	SALIERI	Also identical?
L31277	u255	m16	MOZART	With the tenors.
L31276	u260	m16	SALIERI	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
L31275	u255	m16	MOZART	It couldn't be simpler.
L31274	u260	m16	SALIERI	Please! Just one moment.
L31273	u255	m16	MOZART	Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
L31272	u255	m16	MOZART	Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
L31271	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31270	u255	m16	MOZART	Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
L31269	u255	m16	MOZART	Sing it back.
L31268	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think so.
L31267	u255	m16	MOZART	Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
L31266	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31265	u255	m16	MOZART	Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
L31264	u255	m16	MOZART	Common time.
L31263	u260	m16	SALIERI	What time?
L31262	u255	m16	MOZART	The Fire.
L31261	u255	m16	MOZART	So now - A minor. Suddenly.
L31260	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L31259	u255	m16	MOZART	We ended in F Major?
L31258	u260	m16	SALIERI	Confutatis Maledictis.
L31257	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come. Let's begin.
L31256	u255	m16	MOZART	Strange!
L31255	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh, yes.
L31254	u255	m16	MOZART	A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
L31253	u260	m16	SALIERI	What?
L31252	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you believe in it?
L31251	u260	m16	SALIERI	Consigned to flames of woe.
L31250	u255	m16	MOZART	So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
L31249	u260	m16	SALIERI	The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
L31248	u255	m16	MOZART	Where did I stop?
L31238	u255	m16	MOZART	A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
L31237	u260	m16	SALIERI	Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
L31236	u255	m16	MOZART	You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
L31235	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course.
L31234	u255	m16	MOZART	But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
L31233	u260	m16	SALIERI	My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
L31232	u255	m16	MOZART	Would you? Actually, you could.
L31231	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
L31230	u255	m16	MOZART	Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
L31211	u255	m16	MOZART	He knows. He knows!
L31210	u260	m16	SALIERI	Finish what?
L31209	u255	m16	MOZART	Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
L31207	u260	m16	SALIERI	What man?
L31206	u255	m16	MOZART	The man. He's here.
L31205	u260	m16	SALIERI	Who?
L31204	u255	m16	MOZART	No! No, it's him!
L31203	u260	m16	SALIERI	Shall I answer it?
L31202	u255	m16	MOZART	I'm too young to be so sick.
L31201	u260	m16	SALIERI	What?
L31200	u255	m16	MOZART	The doctor thinks I am. But -
L31199	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you ill?
L31198	u255	m16	MOZART	I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
L31197	u260	m16	SALIERI	I do.
L31196	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you mean that?
L31195	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
L31194	u255	m16	MOZART	This is only a vaudeville.
L31193	u260	m16	SALIERI	I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
L31192	u255	m16	MOZART	I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
L31191	u260	m16	SALIERI	No, please.
L31190	u255	m16	MOZART	You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
L31189	u260	m16	SALIERI	You mean she's not coming back?
L31188	u255	m16	MOZART	Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
L31187	u260	m16	SALIERI	Where is your wife?
L31183	u255	m16	MOZART	No, no. I have to get back. I have -
L31182	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
L31181	u255	m16	MOZART	What happened? Is it over?
L31134	u255	m16	MOZART	No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
L31133	u260	m16	SALIERI	Are you neglecting my request?
L31132	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
L31062	u260	m16	SALIERI	Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
L31061	u255	m16	MOZART	How long will you give me?
L31059	u255	m16	MOZART	How much?
L31058	u260	m16	SALIERI	I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
L31057	u255	m16	MOZART	Who are you?
L31056	u260	m16	SALIERI	A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
L31055	u255	m16	MOZART	What dead? Who is dead?
L31054	u260	m16	SALIERI	A Mass for the dead.
L31053	u255	m16	MOZART	What work?
L31052	u260	m16	SALIERI	I have come to commission work from you.
L30929	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
L30928	u260	m16	SALIERI	You flatter me.
L30927	u255	m16	MOZART	I never knew that music like that was possible.
L30926	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes?
L30925	u255	m16	MOZART	How could it not, Excellency?
L30924	u260	m16	SALIERI	Did my work please you?
L30923	u255	m16	MOZART	How could I not?
L30922	u260	m16	SALIERI	Mozart. It was good of you to come.
L30915	u255	m16	MOZART	Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
L30914	u260	m16	SALIERI	Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
L30913	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
L30912	u260	m16	SALIERI	I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
L30911	u255	m16	MOZART	I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
L30910	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
L30909	u255	m16	MOZART	It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
L30908	u260	m16	SALIERI	I think it's marvelous. Truly.
L30907	u255	m16	MOZART	What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
L30906	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
L30905	u255	m16	MOZART	But what is it they don't like?
L30904	u260	m16	SALIERI	I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
L30903	u255	m16	MOZART	Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
L30880	u255	m16	MOZART	Thank you! Oh, thank you.
L30879	u260	m16	SALIERI	With all my heart, Mozart.
L30878	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, Excellency, would you?
L30877	u260	m16	SALIERI	But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
L30876	u255	m16	MOZART	It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
L30875	u260	m16	SALIERI	How fortunate.
L30874	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
L30873	u260	m16	SALIERI	You burned the score?
L30872	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
L30871	u260	m16	SALIERI	Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
L30870	u255	m16	MOZART	I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
L30869	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really? Why?
L30868	u255	m16	MOZART	It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
L30867	u260	m16	SALIERI	Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
L30565	u260	m16	SALIERI	I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
L30564	u255	m16	MOZART	I can't say. Really
L30563	u260	m16	SALIERI	What exactly are you working on?
L30562	u255	m16	MOZART	Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
L30561	u260	m16	SALIERI	Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
L30560	u255	m16	MOZART	Ah. Italian?
L30559	u260	m16	SALIERI	Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
L30558	u255	m16	MOZART	Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
L30557	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
L30556	u255	m16	MOZART	I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
L30555	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
L30554	u255	m16	MOZART	Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
L30553	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm afraid not.
L30552	u255	m16	MOZART	Do you have a daughter?
L30551	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course not.
L30550	u255	m16	MOZART	They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
L30549	u260	m16	SALIERI	How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
L30548	u255	m16	MOZART	How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
L30547	u260	m16	SALIERI	It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
L30546	u255	m16	MOZART	No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
L30545	u260	m16	SALIERI	You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
L30544	u255	m16	MOZART	Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
L30543	u260	m16	SALIERI	An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
L30542	u255	m16	MOZART	But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
L30541	u260	m16	SALIERI	No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
L30540	u255	m16	MOZART	Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
L30539	u260	m16	SALIERI	Herr Sommer.
L30538	u255	m16	MOZART	Whom did they choose?
L30537	u260	m16	SALIERI	My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
L30536	u255	m16	MOZART	Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
L30535	u260	m16	SALIERI	I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
L30534	u255	m16	MOZART	Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
L30533	u260	m16	SALIERI	Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
L30532	u255	m16	MOZART	So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
L30531	u260	m16	SALIERI	I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
L30530	u255	m16	MOZART	She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
L30529	u260	m16	SALIERI	So you are. How is your pretty wife?
L30528	u255	m16	MOZART	Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
L30527	u260	m16	SALIERI	Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
L30329	u255	m16	MOZART	It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
L30328	u260	m16	SALIERI	How could I not?
L30327	u255	m16	MOZART	Did you like it, then?
L30326	u260	m16	SALIERI	Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
L30283	u255	m16	MOZART	But this is absurd!
L30282	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
L30206	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
L30205	u255	m16	MOZART	Love, Sire!
L30175	u255	m16	MOZART	A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
L30174	u260	m16	SALIERI	Ah!
L30173	u255	m16	MOZART	Mio caro Adone.
L30172	u260	m16	SALIERI	Really?
L30171	u255	m16	MOZART	I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
L30895	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
L30894	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
L30864	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Taking out what you should never have put in.
L30863	u255	m16	MOZART	What are you doing, Herr Director?
L30860	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
L30859	u255	m16	MOZART	But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
L30858	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Exactly. A dance.
L30857	u255	m16	MOZART	Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
L30856	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
L30854	u255	m16	MOZART	Certainly, Herr Director.
L30853	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
L30837	u255	m16	MOZART	Just let me tell you how it begins.
L30836	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	That will do, Herr Mozart!
L30811	u255	m16	MOZART	But, Your Majesty -
L30810	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
L30199	u255	m16	MOZART	Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
L30198	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Then why especially does it have to be in German?
L30197	u255	m16	MOZART	Exactly.
L30196	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You mean in Turkey?
L30190	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	I think you'd better.
L30189	u255	m16	MOZART	I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
L30188	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Oh? Have I seen it?
L30839	u255	m16	MOZART	May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
L30838	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Herr Mozart -
L30397	u255	m16	MOZART	Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
L30396	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
L30395	u255	m16	MOZART	Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
L30394	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Mozart -
L30393	u255	m16	MOZART	They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
L30392	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Mozart -
L30391	u255	m16	MOZART	Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
L30390	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
L30389	u255	m16	MOZART	Who is on this committee?
L30388	u267	m16	VON STRACK	A little modesty would suit you better.
L30387	u255	m16	MOZART	No, but I'm the best.
L30386	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
L30385	u255	m16	MOZART	Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
L30384	u267	m16	VON STRACK	On the contrary.
L30383	u255	m16	MOZART	Is the Emperor angry with me?
L30382	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Because His Majesty wishes it.
L30381	u255	m16	MOZART	Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
L30380	u267	m16	VON STRACK	What is what?
L30379	u255	m16	MOZART	What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
L30826	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
L30825	u255	m16	MOZART	Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
L30824	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
L30823	u255	m16	MOZART	Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
L30822	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Mozart -
L30764	u255	m16	MOZART	Baron!
L30763	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
L30201	u255	m16	MOZART	Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
L30200	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
L30185	u255	m16	MOZART	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
L30184	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	I don't think it was really decided, Director.
L31341	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
L31340	u266	m16	VOGLER	Oh my son, my poor son!
L31339	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
L31338	u266	m16	VOGLER	My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
L31337	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	What difference does that make?
L31336	u266	m16	VOGLER	But not his body.
L31335	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I poisoned his life.
L31334	u266	m16	VOGLER	No, you didn't!
L31333	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I did.
L31332	u266	m16	VOGLER	Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
L31076	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
L31075	u266	m16	VOGLER	Yes.
L31074	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
L31073	u266	m16	VOGLER	What?
L30474	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
L30473	u266	m16	VOGLER	I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
L30472	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
L30471	u266	m16	VOGLER	My son, no one can speak for God.
L30470	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
L30469	u266	m16	VOGLER	God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
L30468	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	No? Was Mozart a good man?
L30467	u266	m16	VOGLER	You cannot say that!
L30466	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
L30342	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
L30341	u266	m16	VOGLER	Did you try?
L30340	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
L30029	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
L30028	u266	m16	VOGLER	Do you hear me?
L30026	u266	m16	VOGLER	Should I?
L30025	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Do you believe it?
L30024	u266	m16	VOGLER	Is it true?
L30023	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	And do they believe it?
L30022	u266	m16	VOGLER	All Vienna has heard that.
L30021	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Ah - you've heard that?
L30020	u266	m16	VOGLER	Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
L30019	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
L30018	u266	m16	VOGLER	Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
L30017	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
L30016	u266	m16	VOGLER	I regret it is not too familiar.
L30015	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Well?
L30013	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
L30012	u266	m16	VOGLER	I can't say I do. What is it?
L30011	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Then you must know this.
L30010	u266	m16	VOGLER	Here in Vienna.
L30009	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Where?
L30008	u266	m16	VOGLER	I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
L30007	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	How well are you trained in music?
L30006	u266	m16	VOGLER	My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
L30005	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	I do not seek forgiveness.
L30004	u266	m16	VOGLER	Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
L30003	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Are they?
L30002	u266	m16	VOGLER	That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
L30001	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
L30000	u266	m16	VOGLER	I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
L29999	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	Leave me alone.
L29998	u266	m16	VOGLER	Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
L29997	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	What do you want?
L29996	u266	m16	VOGLER	In the sight of God that is a sin.
L29995	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	So?
L29994	u266	m16	VOGLER	You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
L29993	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	About what?
L29992	u266	m16	VOGLER	I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
L29991	u257	m16	OLD SALIERI	What do you want?
L30852	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, in the third act.
L30851	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
L30850	u260	m16	SALIERI	Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
L30849	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Ballet? What ballet?
L30848	u260	m16	SALIERI	About the ballet.
L30847	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	What anger?
L30844	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	The Emperor has given him permission.
L30843	u260	m16	SALIERI	Incredible.
L30842	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
L30794	u260	m16	SALIERI	Never mind.
L30793	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Where?
L30792	u260	m16	SALIERI	I've seen the manuscript.
L30791	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Are you absolutely sure?
L30787	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You must be mad.
L30786	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.
L30785	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	He's setting that play to music?
L30784	u260	m16	SALIERI	Exactly.
L30783	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	You mean that play?
L30780	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Italian?
L30779	u260	m16	SALIERI	Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
L30778	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Yes?
L30777	u260	m16	SALIERI	I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
L30799	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Ah.
L30798	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
L30797	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Oh yes, yes. And that was?
L30796	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
L30795	u267	m16	VON STRACK	I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
L30183	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Did we?
L30182	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
L30159	u267	m16	VON STRACK	Well done, Sire!
L30158	u258	m16	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	Bravo, Your Majesty!
L31180	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
L31179	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
L31178	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
L31177	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	What do you mean - now?
L31176	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Well, promise then.
L31175	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	I can't wait.
L31174	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
L31173	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
L31172	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
L31171	u259	m16	PAPAGENO	What? Who the devil are you?
L31170	u265	m16	UGLY OLD WOMAN	Here I am, my angel.
L31050	u260	m16	SALIERI	Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
L31049	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
L31048	u260	m16	SALIERI	No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
L31047	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
L31046	u260	m16	SALIERI	I agree, Baron.
L31045	u268	m16	VON SWIETEN	This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
L30526	u260	m16	SALIERI	Come with me. And stay in the room.
L30525	u264	m16	SERVANT	He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
L30524	u260	m16	SALIERI	What does he want?
L30478	u260	m16	SALIERI	Show her in. Then go to bed.
L30477	u264	m16	SERVANT	That lady is back, sir.
L30417	u260	m16	SALIERI	Excuse me, my dear.
L30416	u264	m16	SERVANT	She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
L30415	u260	m16	SALIERI	Who is she?
L30414	u264	m16	SERVANT	Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
L31226	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
L31225	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
L31223	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
L31222	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	I'll call tomorrow.
L31221	u260	m16	SALIERI	Bene.
L31220	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
L31219	u260	m16	SALIERI	Of course.
L31218	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
L31217	u260	m16	SALIERI	Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
L31216	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	But he's all right?
L31215	u260	m16	SALIERI	Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
L31214	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Can we come in?
L31213	u260	m16	SALIERI	Yes, I am looking after him.
L31212	u261	m16	SCHIKANEDER	Herr Salieri.
L109843	u628	m40	ARGYLE	They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
L109842	u632	m40	LEADER	Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
L109841	u628	m40	ARGYLE	My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
L109840	u632	m40	LEADER	What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
L109839	u628	m40	ARGYLE	We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
L109838	u632	m40	LEADER	Someone dead from this household?
L109855	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
L109854	u642	m40	WILLIAM	What are they doing?
L109851	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
L109850	u642	m40	WILLIAM	It was in Latin, sir.
L109849	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
L109848	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
L109847	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I don't want to leave.
L109846	u628	m40	ARGYLE	We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
L110416	u629	m40	CRAIG	He has already agreed to come.
L110415	u641	m40	WALLACE	I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
L110414	u629	m40	CRAIG	We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
L110413	u641	m40	WALLACE	So let the council swear publicly.
L110412	u629	m40	CRAIG	An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
L110411	u641	m40	WALLACE	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
L110410	u629	m40	CRAIG	Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
L110300	u629	m40	CRAIG	It is suicide.
L110299	u641	m40	WALLACE	With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
L110298	u629	m40	CRAIG	We cannot defeat this --
L110297	u641	m40	WALLACE	Peace?!
L110296	u629	m40	CRAIG	We must sue for peace.
L110295	u641	m40	WALLACE	A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
L110212	u629	m40	CRAIG	Invade?! That's impossible, it --
L110211	u641	m40	WALLACE	I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
L110210	u629	m40	CRAIG	But... what will you do?
L110438	u629	m40	CRAIG	You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
L110437	u639	m40	ROBERT	Longshanks promised!
L110428	u639	m40	ROBERT	He will. I know he will.
L110427	u629	m40	CRAIG	He won't come.
L110409	u629	m40	CRAIG	That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
L110408	u639	m40	ROBERT	The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
L110407	u629	m40	CRAIG	Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
L110406	u639	m40	ROBERT	If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
L110403	u629	m40	CRAIG	It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
L110402	u639	m40	ROBERT	He was a modest man.
L110401	u629	m40	CRAIG	May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
L110197	u629	m40	CRAIG	No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
L110196	u639	m40	ROBERT	Does anyone know his politics?
L109897	u639	m40	ROBERT	He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
L109896	u629	m40	CRAIG	A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
L109893	u629	m40	CRAIG	Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
L109892	u639	m40	ROBERT	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
L109891	u629	m40	CRAIG	Young Robert, we are honored --
L110360	u630	m40	EDWARD	You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
L110359	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
L110348	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
L110347	u630	m40	EDWARD	But if we have not caught Wallace --
L110346	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
L110345	u630	m40	EDWARD	The Scots will fight for us?
L110344	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
L110291	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
L110290	u630	m40	EDWARD	The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
L110241	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
L110240	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace has sacked York!
L110239	u630	m40	EDWARD	I have ordered conscriptions...
L110238	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
L110237	u630	m40	EDWARD	Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
L110236	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	What news of the north?
L110023	u630	m40	EDWARD	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
L110022	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
L110471	u630	m40	EDWARD	Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
L110470	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
L110468	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
L110467	u630	m40	EDWARD	You fancy him.
L110466	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
L110436	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
L110435	u638	m40	PRINCESS	When will his trial be?
L110434	u630	m40	EDWARD	Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
L110433	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Is it true? Wallace is captured?
L110370	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
L110369	u630	m40	EDWARD	The little cow is insane --
L110365	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
L110364	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace's followers.
L110363	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
L110362	u630	m40	EDWARD	You mock us with a smile?
L110361	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Good day to you, M'Lords.
L109887	u630	m40	EDWARD	You may.
L109886	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
L109885	u630	m40	EDWARD	Now, my flower, do you understand?
L109884	u630	m40	EDWARD	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
L109883	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No, M'lord.
L109880	u630	m40	EDWARD	All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
L109879	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
L109878	u630	m40	EDWARD	Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
L109876	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Scotland. He intends --
L109875	u630	m40	EDWARD	So I did! And what was so important about it?
L109874	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
L109873	u630	m40	EDWARD	What is it?!
L110426	u641	m40	WALLACE	No. One of us is enough.
L110425	u631	m40	HAMISH	Keep these. We're going too.
L110424	u641	m40	WALLACE	My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
L110423	u631	m40	HAMISH	Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
L110422	u641	m40	WALLACE	We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
L110421	u631	m40	HAMISH	That's just a dream, William!
L110420	u641	m40	WALLACE	Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
L110419	u631	m40	HAMISH	I don't want to be a martyr.
L110418	u641	m40	WALLACE	Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
L110417	u631	m40	HAMISH	You know it's a trap.
L110398	u631	m40	HAMISH	Your rest is making me exhausted.
L110397	u641	m40	WALLACE	I rest.
L110396	u631	m40	HAMISH	Rest, William.
L110376	u631	m40	HAMISH	We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
L110375	u641	m40	WALLACE	Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
L110317	u631	m40	HAMISH	Aye.
L110316	u641	m40	WALLACE	Stephen ready?
L110315	u641	m40	WALLACE	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
L110314	u631	m40	HAMISH	The Bruce is not coming, William.
L110052	u631	m40	HAMISH	Fourteen? --
L110051	u641	m40	WALLACE	We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
L110046	u641	m40	WALLACE	Hamish, I... thank...
L110045	u631	m40	HAMISH	I'll wait... back there.
L109927	u631	m40	HAMISH	I should'a remembered the eggs.
L109926	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Good to see you again.
L109916	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I will not.
L109915	u631	m40	HAMISH	You'll move
L109913	u631	m40	HAMISH	I could crush you like a roach.
L109912	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
L109911	u631	m40	HAMISH	That depends on the man.
L109910	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
L109907	u642	m40	WILLIAM	The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
L109906	u631	m40	HAMISH	Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
L109905	u642	m40	WILLIAM	You win.
L109904	u631	m40	HAMISH	Test of manhood.
L109833	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Aye, we'll get 'em.
L109832	u631	m40	HAMISH	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
L109831	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I wanna have supper waitin'.
L109830	u631	m40	HAMISH	Wanna stay with me tonight?
L109828	u642	m40	WILLIAM	It's up to us, Hamish!
L109827	u631	m40	HAMISH	With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
L109826	u642	m40	WILLIAM	They're English soldiers, ain't they?
L109825	u631	m40	HAMISH	Armed?
L109824	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Three, maybe more!
L109823	u631	m40	HAMISH	How many?
L109822	u642	m40	WILLIAM	They're coming!
L110089	u640	m40	STEPHEN	They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
L110088	u631	m40	HAMISH	We don't split up!
L110087	u640	m40	STEPHEN	We must run in different directions!
L110069	u640	m40	STEPHEN	A patriot!
L110068	u631	m40	HAMISH	A common thief.
L110067	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
L110063	u640	m40	STEPHEN	In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
L110062	u631	m40	HAMISH	Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
L110061	u640	m40	STEPHEN	All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
L110355	u633	m40	LEPER	All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
L110354	u639	m40	ROBERT	In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
L110353	u633	m40	LEPER	We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
L110352	u639	m40	ROBERT	He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
L110351	u633	m40	LEPER	So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
L110350	u639	m40	ROBERT	He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
L110349	u633	m40	LEPER	I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
L110368	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
L110367	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Let her speak.
L110366	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have faced him. Have you?
L110289	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
L110288	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
L110287	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
L110286	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
L110284	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Humbly, M'lord.
L110283	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
L110282	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
L110281	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
L110280	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
L110279	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
L110278	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. He did not.
L110277	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
L109869	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
L109868	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Shall I leave, M'lord?
L109867	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
L109866	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
L109865	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Where is my son?
L110447	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
L110446	u641	m40	WALLACE	I do not confess.
L110445	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
L110444	u641	m40	WALLACE	-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
L110443	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	It matters not, he is thy king!
L110442	u641	m40	WALLACE	Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
L110441	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
L110440	u641	m40	WALLACE	Treason. Against whom?
L109978	u636	m40	MARION	...Tonight!
L109977	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Then when?
L109976	u636	m40	MARION	My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
L109975	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Tonight then.
L109974	u636	m40	MARION	Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
L109973	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I've missed you.
L109967	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I will be with you, like this. Forever.
L109966	u636	m40	MARION	This night is too beautiful to have again.
L109965	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
L109964	u636	m40	MARION	You scare me.
L109963	u642	m40	WILLIAM	But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
L109962	u636	m40	MARION	Nor I!
L109961	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I'm not just saying it!
L109960	u636	m40	MARION	I... accept your proposal!
L109959	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I want... to marry you!
L109958	u642	m40	WILLIAM	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
L109957	u636	m40	MARION	Did it work?
L109956	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
L109955	u636	m40	MARION	You've been here before?
L109944	u636	m40	MARION	You are. And I'll come again.
L109943	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
L109942	u636	m40	MARION	Thank you for inviting.
L109941	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Thank you for accepting.
L109940	u636	m40	MARION	It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
L109939	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Your father doesn't like me, does he?
L110083	u636	m40	MARION	Wake up, William. Wake up!
L110082	u641	m40	WALLACE	I need you so much! I love you!
L110081	u636	m40	MARION	And I with you. But you must wake.
L110080	u641	m40	WALLACE	I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
L110079	u636	m40	MARION	Yes, you are. And you must wake.
L110078	u641	m40	WALLACE	I'm dreaming.
L110122	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...I wouldn't know.
L110121	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
L110120	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
L110119	u638	m40	PRINCESS	This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
L110118	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
L110117	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
L110116	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
L110115	u638	m40	PRINCESS	How do you know this?
L110114	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
L110465	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
L110464	u641	m40	WALLACE	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
L110463	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Drink this! It will dull your pain.
L110462	u641	m40	WALLACE	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
L110461	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You will die! It will be awful!
L110459	u641	m40	WALLACE	If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
L110458	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
L110457	u641	m40	WALLACE	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
L110456	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
L110455	u641	m40	WALLACE	M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
L110393	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
L110392	u641	m40	WALLACE	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
L110391	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
L110390	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
L110389	u641	m40	WALLACE	You have... you have a husband.
L110386	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
L110385	u641	m40	WALLACE	Why did you?
L110380	u638	m40	PRINCESS	It does me good to see you.
L110379	u641	m40	WALLACE	A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
L110274	u641	m40	WALLACE	She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
L110273	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
L110272	u641	m40	WALLACE	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
L110271	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Peace is made is such ways.
L110270	u641	m40	WALLACE	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
L110269	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
L110260	u638	m40	PRINCESS	That is not possible.
L110259	u641	m40	WALLACE	York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
L110258	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
L110257	u641	m40	WALLACE	I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
L110256	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
L110255	u638	m40	PRINCESS	But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
L110254	u641	m40	WALLACE	It's battle I want, not talk.
L110253	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
L110252	u641	m40	WALLACE	Wife of Edward, the king's son?
L110251	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I am the Princess of Wales.
L110309	u641	m40	WALLACE	And I will consult with mine.
L110308	u639	m40	ROBERT	I must... consult with my father.
L110307	u641	m40	WALLACE	Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
L110306	u639	m40	ROBERT	I am trying.
L110305	u641	m40	WALLACE	War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
L110220	u641	m40	WALLACE	Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
L110219	u639	m40	ROBERT	I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
L110218	u641	m40	WALLACE	We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
L110217	u639	m40	ROBERT	No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
L110216	u641	m40	WALLACE	And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
L110215	u639	m40	ROBERT	Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
L110400	u641	m40	WALLACE	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
L110399	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Come, it'll help you sleep.
L110156	u641	m40	WALLACE	Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
L110155	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Fine speech. Now what do we do?
L110107	u641	m40	WALLACE	No English lord would trust an Irishman!
L110106	u640	m40	STEPHEN	I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
L110099	u641	m40	WALLACE	Exactly.
L110098	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Who would do such a thing?
L110097	u641	m40	WALLACE	The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
L110096	u640	m40	STEPHEN	What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
L110095	u641	m40	WALLACE	They've tricked us.
L110094	u640	m40	STEPHEN	We can't stop!
L180382	u832	m53	MERRICK	If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
L180381	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
L180380	u832	m53	MERRICK	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
L180379	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
L180375	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, yes.
L180374	u824	m53	ANNE	I've always thought that myself.
L180373	u832	m53	MERRICK	They have noble faces.
L180370	u832	m53	MERRICK	How lovely.
L180369	u824	m53	ANNE	And here is one of Frederick's mother.
L180352	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh?
L180351	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
L180348	u832	m53	MERRICK	Two, please.
L180347	u824	m53	ANNE	One or two?
L180346	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes please, two.
L180345	u824	m53	ANNE	Mr. Merrick, sugar?
L180508	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh Frederick.
L180507	u838	m53	TREVES	...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
L180506	u824	m53	ANNE	Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
L180505	u838	m53	TREVES	But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
L180504	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
L180503	u838	m53	TREVES	That I am very little different from him.
L180502	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
L180501	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
L180500	u824	m53	ANNE	...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
L180499	u838	m53	TREVES	Hmmm?
L180498	u824	m53	ANNE	More romances for John?
L180497	u824	m53	ANNE	Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
L180496	u838	m53	TREVES	You stay with me.
L180372	u824	m53	ANNE	And here are my mother and father.
L180371	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180350	u824	m53	ANNE	Do you?
L180349	u838	m53	TREVES	John loves the house.
L180168	u838	m53	TREVES	I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
L180167	u824	m53	ANNE	Well, these things take time.
L180166	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
L180165	u824	m53	ANNE	I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
L180164	u838	m53	TREVES	And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
L180163	u824	m53	ANNE	Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
L180162	u838	m53	TREVES	I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
L180161	u824	m53	ANNE	Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
L180160	u838	m53	TREVES	He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
L180159	u824	m53	ANNE	But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
L180158	u838	m53	TREVES	Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
L180157	u824	m53	ANNE	What do you mean?
L180156	u838	m53	TREVES	I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
L180155	u824	m53	ANNE	Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
L179960	u838	m53	TREVES	No, I think a whiskey.
L179959	u824	m53	ANNE	Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
L179958	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
L179957	u824	m53	ANNE	Did it go well, darling?
L179847	u838	m53	TREVES	I'll join you shortly.
L179846	u824	m53	ANNE	You won't be long?
L179972	u838	m53	TREVES	I'll get my bag.
L179971	u825	m53	BOY	Like this. 
L179970	u838	m53	TREVES	What is it?
L179969	u825	m53	BOY	Our man is sick. Come right away.
L179889	u838	m53	TREVES	Did you see it?
L179888	u825	m53	BOY	I found it.
L179887	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes?
L179886	u825	m53	BOY	Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
L180635	u826	m53	BYTES	Shut up!
L180634	u825	m53	BOY	Don't!
L180633	u826	m53	BYTES	I'll show you! I'll show you!
L180632	u825	m53	BOY	What are you going to do?
L180631	u826	m53	BYTES	If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
L180630	u825	m53	BOY	He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
L180629	u826	m53	BYTES	He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
L180628	u825	m53	BOY	Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
L180627	u826	m53	BYTES	You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
L180145	u826	m53	BYTES	Right... Right.
L180144	u838	m53	TREVES	Now I think we really do understand one another.
L180141	u826	m53	BYTES	I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
L180140	u838	m53	TREVES	So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
L180139	u826	m53	BYTES	I want him back!
L180138	u838	m53	TREVES	You don't own this man!
L180137	u826	m53	BYTES	You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
L180136	u838	m53	TREVES	All you do is profit from another man's misery!
L180135	u826	m53	BYTES	He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
L180134	u838	m53	TREVES	I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
L180133	u826	m53	BYTES	Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
L180132	u838	m53	TREVES	You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
L180131	u826	m53	BYTES	DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
L180130	u838	m53	TREVES	He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
L180129	u826	m53	BYTES	Never mind that, I want my man!
L180128	u838	m53	TREVES	Just a moment, how did you get in here?
L180127	u826	m53	BYTES	I want my man back.
L179988	u838	m53	TREVES	Everything will be seen to.
L179987	u826	m53	BYTES	I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
L179985	u838	m53	TREVES	"You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his ""fall"". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab."
L179984	u826	m53	BYTES	Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
L179983	u838	m53	TREVES	This man belongs in hospital.
L179982	u826	m53	BYTES	That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
L179981	u838	m53	TREVES	Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
L179980	u826	m53	BYTES	He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
L179979	u838	m53	TREVES	He must have taken quite a fall.
L179978	u826	m53	BYTES	He fell.  He falls.
L179977	u838	m53	TREVES	What happened?
L179976	u838	m53	TREVES	I intend to.
L179975	u826	m53	BYTES	He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
L179974	u838	m53	TREVES	What do you mean?
L179973	u826	m53	BYTES	What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
L180516	u827	m53	CARR	Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
L180515	u838	m53	TREVES	Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
L180318	u838	m53	TREVES	Please do.
L180317	u827	m53	CARR	Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
L180316	u838	m53	TREVES	But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
L180315	u827	m53	CARR	Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
L180314	u838	m53	TREVES	Has the response picked up?
L180256	u827	m53	CARR	Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
L180255	u838	m53	TREVES	No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
L180254	u827	m53	CARR	Don't we?
L180242	u827	m53	CARR	Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
L180241	u838	m53	TREVES	Do you think they'll go along with us?
L180240	u827	m53	CARR	Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
L180239	u838	m53	TREVES	Well, yes.
L180238	u827	m53	CARR	No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
L180237	u838	m53	TREVES	I could easily arrange...
L180236	u827	m53	CARR	You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
L180235	u827	m53	CARR	No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
L180234	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I think I can.
L180233	u827	m53	CARR	Can you imagine what his life has been like?
L180227	u838	m53	TREVES	Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
L180226	u827	m53	CARR	Treves. Well done.
L180218	u838	m53	TREVES	Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
L180217	u827	m53	CARR	I don't understand.
L180216	u838	m53	TREVES	How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
L180210	u827	m53	CARR	I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
L180209	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
L180208	u827	m53	CARR	It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
L180193	u838	m53	TREVES	And what was that, John?
L180192	u827	m53	CARR	Oh yes?
L180179	u827	m53	CARR	Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
L180178	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
L180177	u827	m53	CARR	He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
L180176	u838	m53	TREVES	...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
L180175	u827	m53	CARR	Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
L180174	u838	m53	TREVES	It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
L180151	u838	m53	TREVES	...Yes, Sir.
L180150	u827	m53	CARR	Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
L180149	u838	m53	TREVES	Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
L180148	u827	m53	CARR	Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
L180147	u838	m53	TREVES	Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
L180146	u827	m53	CARR	Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
L180126	u827	m53	CARR	Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
L180125	u838	m53	TREVES	Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
L180124	u827	m53	CARR	"No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."
L180123	u838	m53	TREVES	I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
L180122	u827	m53	CARR	I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
L180121	u838	m53	TREVES	Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
L180120	u827	m53	CARR	A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
L180119	u838	m53	TREVES	He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
L180118	u827	m53	CARR	Good! How is the patient?
L180117	u838	m53	TREVES	Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
L180116	u827	m53	CARR	Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
L180016	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
L180015	u827	m53	CARR	I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
L180014	u838	m53	TREVES	No, more of an acquaintance.
L180013	u827	m53	CARR	Oh, is he a friend of yours?
L180012	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
L180011	u827	m53	CARR	What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
L180010	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes sir.
L180009	u827	m53	CARR	Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
L180008	u838	m53	TREVES	Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
L180007	u827	m53	CARR	Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
L180006	u838	m53	TREVES	No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
L180005	u827	m53	CARR	A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
L180004	u827	m53	CARR	Indeed!
L180003	u838	m53	TREVES	Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
L180000	u827	m53	CARR	Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
L179999	u838	m53	TREVES	It's quite nutritious, sir.
L179998	u827	m53	CARR	You've acquired a taste for this?
L179997	u838	m53	TREVES	Good morning, sir.
L179996	u827	m53	CARR	Good morning, Treves.
L180222	u827	m53	CARR	I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
L180221	u832	m53	MERRICK	I am very pleased to meet you.
L180220	u827	m53	CARR	It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
L180213	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
L180212	u827	m53	CARR	What is it, Treves?
L180205	u827	m53	CARR	Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
L180204	u832	m53	MERRICK	...everyone has been very kind.
L180203	u827	m53	CARR	Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
L180202	u832	m53	MERRICK	...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
L180189	u832	m53	MERRICK	Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
L180188	u827	m53	CARR	Are you comfortable here?
L180187	u832	m53	MERRICK	I feel much better. Thank you.
L180186	u827	m53	CARR	I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
L180185	u832	m53	MERRICK	I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
L180184	u827	m53	CARR	How are you feeling today?
L179952	u838	m53	TREVES	He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
L179951	u828	m53	FOX	You never mentioned his mental state.
L179934	u828	m53	FOX	Nothing of any importance, eh?
L179933	u838	m53	TREVES	I don't know what I've got.
L179932	u828	m53	FOX	Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
L179931	u838	m53	TREVES	You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
L179930	u828	m53	FOX	Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
L179892	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
L179891	u828	m53	FOX	I say Freddie, what are you about?
L179878	u828	m53	FOX	What a mess.
L179877	u838	m53	TREVES	Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
L179876	u838	m53	TREVES	Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
L179875	u828	m53	FOX	Three quarters of an hour.
L179874	u838	m53	TREVES	How long has this man been here?
L180711	u829	m53	K. HEN	"I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say ""I love you"". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly."
L180710	u830	m53	KATH	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
L180709	u829	m53	K. HEN	What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
L180708	u830	m53	KATH	O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
L180707	u829	m53	K. HEN	An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
L180706	u830	m53	KATH	"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."
L180705	u829	m53	K. HEN	O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
L180704	u830	m53	KATH	Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
L180703	u829	m53	K. HEN	Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
L180436	u831	m53	KENDAL	Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
L180435	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no?
L180434	u831	m53	KENDAL	Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
L180433	u832	m53	MERRICK	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
L180432	u831	m53	KENDAL	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
L180431	u832	m53	MERRICK	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
L180428	u832	m53	MERRICK	No, but I certainly shall.
L180427	u831	m53	KENDAL	Have you read it?
L180426	u831	m53	KENDAL	That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
L180425	u832	m53	MERRICK	Romance!
L180424	u831	m53	KENDAL	It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
L180423	u832	m53	MERRICK	Tell me about it, please!
L180422	u831	m53	KENDAL	Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
L180421	u832	m53	MERRICK	Alas, no.
L180420	u831	m53	KENDAL	You've never been?
L180419	u832	m53	MERRICK	Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
L180418	u831	m53	KENDAL	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
L180417	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
L180416	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180415	u831	m53	KENDAL	She's very pretty, your mother.
L180414	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
L180413	u831	m53	KENDAL	I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
L180412	u831	m53	KENDAL	I knew you'd understand. Here.
L180411	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, no.
L180410	u831	m53	KENDAL	I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
L180409	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good day...!
L180699	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180698	u831	m53	KENDAL	Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
L180697	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
L180696	u831	m53	KENDAL	Is he... dying then?
L180695	u838	m53	TREVES	And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
L180694	u831	m53	KENDAL	How awful for John.
L180693	u838	m53	TREVES	I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
L180692	u831	m53	KENDAL	Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
L180691	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
L180690	u831	m53	KENDAL	It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
L180408	u831	m53	KENDAL	Good day, Mr. Merrick.
L180407	u838	m53	TREVES	John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
L180661	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
L180660	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, yes.
L180659	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
L180658	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no, my friend...
L180657	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
L180646	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Won't be a moment.
L180645	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180644	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Of course! You want out?
L180643	u832	m53	MERRICK	You're English.
L180642	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Want to come out?
L180641	u832	m53	MERRICK	y-y-yes--
L180640	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	You alright?
L180402	u835	m53	NORA	Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
L180401	u832	m53	MERRICK	I'll have to find some more.
L180399	u832	m53	MERRICK	...I learned a long time ago.
L180398	u835	m53	NORA	The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
L180397	u832	m53	MERRICK	The main spire.
L180396	u835	m53	NORA	What's this?
L180395	u835	m53	NORA	It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
L180394	u832	m53	MERRICK	I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
L180393	u835	m53	NORA	The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
L180392	u835	m53	NORA	Where did you get this box?
L180391	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thank you... very much.
L180390	u835	m53	NORA	But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
L180389	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180388	u835	m53	NORA	What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
L180385	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good morning.
L180384	u835	m53	NORA	Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
L180329	u832	m53	MERRICK	No, nothing.
L180328	u835	m53	NORA	Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
L180327	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thank you very much.
L180325	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180324	u835	m53	NORA	Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
L180732	u832	m53	MERRICK	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
L180731	u838	m53	TREVES	Goodnight John. Sleep well.
L180729	u838	m53	TREVES	No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
L180728	u832	m53	MERRICK	Then I shouldn't change anything?
L180727	u838	m53	TREVES	No, John, not one that I can see.
L180726	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
L180725	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes John?
L180723	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
L180722	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh yes! It was wonderful!
L180721	u838	m53	TREVES	Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
L180720	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes, very soon.
L180719	u838	m53	TREVES	Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
L180716	u838	m53	TREVES	It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
L180715	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no, I couldn't.
L180714	u838	m53	TREVES	Stand up, John. Let them see you.
L180689	u838	m53	TREVES	John.... how can you ever forgive me?
L180688	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves! Treves.
L180551	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
L180550	u838	m53	TREVES	Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
L180549	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
L180548	u838	m53	TREVES	Is it the one you wanted?
L180547	u838	m53	TREVES	There is one more thing, John. Here.
L180546	u832	m53	MERRICK	My home.
L180545	u832	m53	MERRICK	Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
L180544	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180543	u832	m53	MERRICK	You did this for me?
L180542	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, John.
L180541	u832	m53	MERRICK	...my... home?
L180483	u832	m53	MERRICK	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
L180482	u838	m53	TREVES	You want a dressing bag, John?
L180481	u838	m53	TREVES	Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
L180480	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
L180479	u838	m53	TREVES	How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
L180478	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
L180477	u838	m53	TREVES	The cathedral is coming along nicely.
L180471	u832	m53	MERRICK	I thought as much.
L180470	u838	m53	TREVES	No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
L180469	u832	m53	MERRICK	...Can you cure me?
L180468	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, John?
L180467	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
L180466	u838	m53	TREVES	Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
L180465	u832	m53	MERRICK	When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
L180406	u838	m53	TREVES	John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
L180405	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good morning.
L180404	u838	m53	TREVES	Good morning, John.
L180378	u832	m53	MERRICK	Here.
L180377	u838	m53	TREVES	Your mother?
L180376	u832	m53	MERRICK	Would you... would you like to see my mother?
L180368	u832	m53	MERRICK	Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
L180367	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
L180366	u832	m53	MERRICK	The Children. Where are your children
L180365	u838	m53	TREVES	Of course.
L180364	u832	m53	MERRICK	The children! May I see?
L180363	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh, our relatives... the children.
L180362	u832	m53	MERRICK	Who are they of?
L180361	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh yes.
L180360	u832	m53	MERRICK	I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
L180359	u838	m53	TREVES	Not at all, John.
L180358	u832	m53	MERRICK	It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
L180357	u838	m53	TREVES	How is your tea, John?
L180356	u832	m53	MERRICK	Ohhh...
L180355	u838	m53	TREVES	That's a canopy, John.
L180354	u832	m53	MERRICK	Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
L180339	u832	m53	MERRICK	I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
L180338	u838	m53	TREVES	John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
L180332	u838	m53	TREVES	When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
L180331	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thank you very much.
L180330	u838	m53	TREVES	You look splendid, John.
L180312	u838	m53	TREVES	I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
L180311	u832	m53	MERRICK	How long will I stay here?
L180310	u838	m53	TREVES	Of course! What did you think?
L180309	u832	m53	MERRICK	The hospital?
L180308	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180307	u832	m53	MERRICK	This... is my new home?
L180297	u838	m53	TREVES	Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
L180296	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
L180295	u838	m53	TREVES	Good evening. How are you feeling?
L180232	u838	m53	TREVES	We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
L180231	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
L180230	u838	m53	TREVES	I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
L180229	u832	m53	MERRICK	You did not ask me.
L180228	u838	m53	TREVES	Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
L180196	u832	m53	MERRICK	But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
L180195	u838	m53	TREVES	...Yes potatoes... but...
L180191	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
L180190	u838	m53	TREVES	Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
L180182	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
L180181	u838	m53	TREVES	John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
L180173	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
L180172	u838	m53	TREVES	"Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say ""May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm."" And you will say..."
L180171	u832	m53	MERRICK	Righteousness for his namesake.
L180170	u838	m53	TREVES	Righteousness...
L180169	u832	m53	MERRICK	The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
L180109	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello, my name is John Merrick.
L180108	u838	m53	TREVES	Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
L180104	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
L180103	u838	m53	TREVES	Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
L180102	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mmmerrick.
L180101	u838	m53	TREVES	"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
L180100	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mmmerrick.
L180099	u838	m53	TREVES	"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
L180098	u832	m53	MERRICK	Merrick...
L180097	u838	m53	TREVES	"Say ""Merrick""."
L180096	u832	m53	MERRICK	John... Merrick
L180095	u838	m53	TREVES	John Merrick.
L180094	u832	m53	MERRICK	My... name is...
L180093	u838	m53	TREVES	My name is...
L180092	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello...
L180091	u838	m53	TREVES	"Excellent! Now, say... ""Hello"""
L180090	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180089	u838	m53	TREVES	Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
L180088	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes!
L180087	u838	m53	TREVES	"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."
L180086	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yyess.
L180085	u838	m53	TREVES	Yyyess.
L180084	u832	m53	MERRICK	...Yyes
L180083	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes John!
L180082	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
L180540	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Welcome home, John.
L180539	u838	m53	TREVES	So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
L180493	u838	m53	TREVES	John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
L180492	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Well...
L180491	u838	m53	TREVES	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
L180490	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	A dressing bag?
L180489	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes. John wants it.
L180488	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Very smart indeed.
L180487	u838	m53	TREVES	A dressing bag.
L180486	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Yes sir.  What's that?
L180485	u838	m53	TREVES	Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
L180484	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
L180463	u838	m53	TREVES	You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
L180462	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
L180461	u838	m53	TREVES	Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
L180460	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
L180459	u838	m53	TREVES	Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
L180458	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
L180457	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
L180456	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
L180455	u838	m53	TREVES	Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
L180453	u838	m53	TREVES	I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
L180452	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Watery headed bunch.
L180113	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
L180112	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
L180111	u838	m53	TREVES	We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
L180110	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
L180076	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
L180075	u838	m53	TREVES	"He's had his share of ""smacks"", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man."
L180071	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
L180070	u838	m53	TREVES	No, he's very upset about something.
L180069	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Won't come out, eh?
L180068	u838	m53	TREVES	Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
L180067	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
L180041	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes! The workhouse!
L180040	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	The workhouse.
L180033	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes... Yes, let's go in.
L180032	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
L180031	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
L180030	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	I've heard.
L180029	u838	m53	TREVES	Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
L180028	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Fine.
L180027	u838	m53	TREVES	Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
L180601	u838	m53	TREVES	YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
L180600	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
L180599	u838	m53	TREVES	YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
L180598	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
L180597	u838	m53	TREVES	HE'S GONE!
L180596	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
L180595	u838	m53	TREVES	Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
L180594	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
L180593	u838	m53	TREVES	WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
L179912	u838	m53	TREVES	I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
L179911	u836	m53	OWNER	Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
L179910	u838	m53	TREVES	So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
L179904	u836	m53	OWNER	Never mind. I'm the owner.
L179903	u838	m53	TREVES	Pardon me?
L179902	u836	m53	OWNER	Handsomely?... Who sent you?
L179901	u838	m53	TREVES	I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
L179900	u836	m53	OWNER	I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
L179899	u838	m53	TREVES	Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
L179898	u836	m53	OWNER	And who might you be, sir?
L179897	u838	m53	TREVES	Are you the proprietor?
L221504	u942	m62	BARNES	I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
L221503	u955	m62	FRANCES	'Forgive'...? For What?
L221502	u942	m62	BARNES	Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
L221501	u955	m62	FRANCES	Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
L221500	u942	m62	BARNES	Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
L221499	u955	m62	FRANCES	Putting on my armor.
L221498	u942	m62	BARNES	What're you doing?
L221497	u955	m62	FRANCES	Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
L221496	u942	m62	BARNES	Frances?  Oh no.
L221479	u942	m62	BARNES	Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
L221478	u955	m62	FRANCES	So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
L221477	u942	m62	BARNES	Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
L221476	u955	m62	FRANCES	You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
L221475	u942	m62	BARNES	Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
L221474	u955	m62	FRANCES	But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
L221473	u942	m62	BARNES	Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
L221472	u955	m62	FRANCES	This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
L221471	u942	m62	BARNES	Well... come on.
L221389	u943	m62	BEBE	I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
L221388	u961	m62	LAWYER	Oh. I mean, good.
L221387	u943	m62	BEBE	That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
L221386	u961	m62	LAWYER	Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
L221385	u943	m62	BEBE	I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
L221384	u961	m62	LAWYER	Excuse me, sir?
L221383	u943	m62	BEBE	I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
L221382	u961	m62	LAWYER	And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
L221161	u943	m62	BEBE	Very fine bone structure.
L221160	u944	m62	CLAIRE	I guess so, sir.
L221159	u943	m62	BEBE	Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
L221158	u944	m62	CLAIRE	Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
L221157	u943	m62	BEBE	Who's this?
L221156	u944	m62	CLAIRE	Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
L221470	u943	m62	BEBE	I'd like nothing better.
L221469	u955	m62	FRANCES	Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
L221230	u943	m62	BEBE	That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
L221229	u955	m62	FRANCES	But I'm the one up there on the screen.
L221228	u943	m62	BEBE	No, I'm concerned with everything.
L221227	u955	m62	FRANCES	But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
L221226	u943	m62	BEBE	Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
L221225	u943	m62	BEBE	Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
L221224	u955	m62	FRANCES	Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
L221223	u943	m62	BEBE	"Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called ""Come and Get It."""
L221222	u943	m62	BEBE	I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
L221221	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thank you --
L221220	u943	m62	BEBE	I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
L221219	u943	m62	BEBE	You see: We've got to change that name.
L221218	u955	m62	FRANCES	That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
L221310	u944	m62	CLAIRE	...acts. I'll relay your message.
L221309	u955	m62	FRANCES	I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
L221308	u944	m62	CLAIRE	I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
L221307	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
L221306	u944	m62	CLAIRE	That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
L221304	u955	m62	FRANCES	Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
L221303	u944	m62	CLAIRE	You know what I mean.
L221302	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
L221301	u944	m62	CLAIRE	Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
L221300	u955	m62	FRANCES	It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
L221299	u944	m62	CLAIRE	Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
L221298	u955	m62	FRANCES	My clothes?
L221297	u944	m62	CLAIRE	Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
L221296	u955	m62	FRANCES	Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
L221295	u944	m62	CLAIRE	Hi Frances, got a minute?
L221381	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	Come here. I want to show you something.
L221380	u955	m62	FRANCES	Huh.
L221379	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	Okay, but come here first.
L221378	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
L221377	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
L221376	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thank you.
L221375	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	Madam...?
L221374	u955	m62	FRANCES	What?
L221373	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	Good, good. Give them that.
L221372	u955	m62	FRANCES	God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
L221371	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
L221370	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm not!
L221369	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	You're afraid!
L221368	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm not!
L221367	u945	m62	CLIFFORD	Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
L221450	u946	m62	CLURMAN	He knows, Frances.
L221449	u955	m62	FRANCES	Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
L221448	u946	m62	CLURMAN	Right now we have to be practical.
L221447	u955	m62	FRANCES	What does Clifford say?
L221446	u946	m62	CLURMAN	I know, but --
L221445	u955	m62	FRANCES	But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
L221444	u946	m62	CLURMAN	Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
L221443	u955	m62	FRANCES	A rich actress.
L221442	u946	m62	CLURMAN	An actress.
L221441	u955	m62	FRANCES	Who?
L221440	u946	m62	CLURMAN	What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
L221439	u955	m62	FRANCES	You don't think I'm good enough?
L221438	u946	m62	CLURMAN	Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
L221437	u955	m62	FRANCES	That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
L221436	u946	m62	CLURMAN	I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
L221435	u955	m62	FRANCES	What's up?
L221433	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh.
L221432	u946	m62	CLURMAN	He's not here.
L221431	u955	m62	FRANCES	Where's Clifford?
L221430	u946	m62	CLURMAN	Frances.
L221429	u955	m62	FRANCES	Hello, Harold.
L221365	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
L221364	u946	m62	CLURMAN	...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
L221345	u955	m62	FRANCES	Who is she?
L221344	u946	m62	CLURMAN	Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
L221343	u955	m62	FRANCES	Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
L221342	u946	m62	CLURMAN	The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
L221588	u947	m62	COP	You're under arrest.
L221587	u955	m62	FRANCES	GET OUT!
L221586	u947	m62	COP	Get your clothes on, lady --
L221585	u955	m62	FRANCES	You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
L221584	u947	m62	COP	Get your clothes on.
L221517	u947	m62	COP	I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
L221516	u955	m62	FRANCES	Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
L221515	u947	m62	COP	"Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says ""Dimout Zone?""  There's a war on, you know?"
L221514	u955	m62	FRANCES	In my eyes, officer.
L221513	u947	m62	COP	Hey, where's the fire, sister?
L221338	u955	m62	FRANCES	You want his name?
L221337	u948	m62	DICK	The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
L221336	u955	m62	FRANCES	What night?
L221335	u948	m62	DICK	No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
L221334	u955	m62	FRANCES	No?
L221333	u948	m62	DICK	I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
L221332	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dick...
L221331	u948	m62	DICK	Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
L221330	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dick, I can't even breathe here...
L221329	u948	m62	DICK	Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
L221328	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dick, we need some time apart --
L221327	u948	m62	DICK	You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
L221326	u955	m62	FRANCES	Showdown.
L221325	u948	m62	DICK	Without me.
L221324	u955	m62	FRANCES	...Yes.
L221323	u948	m62	DICK	There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
L221322	u948	m62	DICK	Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
L221321	u955	m62	FRANCES	Fired?
L221320	u948	m62	DICK	Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
L221319	u955	m62	FRANCES	Claire?
L221318	u948	m62	DICK	Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
L221317	u955	m62	FRANCES	Who?
L221316	u948	m62	DICK	There've been some calls.
L221315	u955	m62	FRANCES	Sort of.
L221314	u948	m62	DICK	You learn your lines?
L221936	u949	m62	DOCTOR	Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
L221935	u956	m62	HARRY	All square, Doc.
L221934	u949	m62	DOCTOR	We're all square now, Harry. Right?
L221932	u956	m62	HARRY	I gotta go now.
L221931	u949	m62	DOCTOR	Harry!
L221928	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
L221927	u949	m62	DOCTOR	Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
L221922	u949	m62	DOCTOR	I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
L221921	u956	m62	HARRY	Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
L221920	u949	m62	DOCTOR	The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
L221919	u956	m62	HARRY	Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
L222024	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thank you, Harry.
L222023	u950	m62	DOYLE	We'll get you home, Frances.
L222022	u955	m62	FRANCES	Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
L221908	u955	m62	FRANCES	One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
L221907	u950	m62	DOYLE	We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
L221906	u955	m62	FRANCES	...I see.
L221905	u950	m62	DOYLE	Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
L221904	u955	m62	FRANCES	You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
L221903	u950	m62	DOYLE	Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
L221902	u955	m62	FRANCES	No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
L221901	u950	m62	DOYLE	I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
L221900	u955	m62	FRANCES	...Don't you?
L221899	u950	m62	DOYLE	I know you believe that.
L221898	u955	m62	FRANCES	Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
L221081	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thank you.
L221080	u951	m62	DRAMA TEACHER	New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
L221079	u955	m62	FRANCES	Really?
L221078	u951	m62	DRAMA TEACHER	Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
L221077	u955	m62	FRANCES	But I'll never win that.
L221076	u951	m62	DRAMA TEACHER	"This is the answer: a subscription drive to ""Voice of Action!"" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!"
L222051	u952	m62	EDWARDS	Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
L222050	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thank you, Ralph.
L222047	u955	m62	FRANCES	No. Never.
L222046	u952	m62	EDWARDS	Were you a drug addict?
L222045	u955	m62	FRANCES	No.
L222044	u952	m62	EDWARDS	Were you an alcoholic?
L222043	u955	m62	FRANCES	...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
L222042	u952	m62	EDWARDS	...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
L222002	u955	m62	FRANCES	I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
L222001	u953	m62	ERNEST	Are you... are you hungry?
L221999	u955	m62	FRANCES	Daddy!
L221998	u953	m62	ERNEST	Please, Francie...
L221997	u955	m62	FRANCES	You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
L221996	u953	m62	ERNEST	But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
L221995	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
L221994	u953	m62	ERNEST	They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
L221993	u955	m62	FRANCES	Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
L221992	u953	m62	ERNEST	Francie, you know I can't do that.
L221844	u953	m62	ERNEST	I love you too, Francie.
L221843	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't care, Dad. I love you.
L221842	u953	m62	ERNEST	I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
L221841	u953	m62	ERNEST	Always. Always.
L221840	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
L221839	u953	m62	ERNEST	Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
L221838	u955	m62	FRANCES	But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
L221837	u953	m62	ERNEST	What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
L221836	u955	m62	FRANCES	I know that, Dad, but --
L221835	u953	m62	ERNEST	I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
L221834	u955	m62	FRANCES	...So what do you think?
L221145	u953	m62	ERNEST	Be careful, Francie.
L221144	u955	m62	FRANCES	I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
L221130	u953	m62	ERNEST	...Then go.
L221129	u955	m62	FRANCES	If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
L221128	u953	m62	ERNEST	And you think it's worth all this?
L221127	u955	m62	FRANCES	Of course.
L221126	u953	m62	ERNEST	You really want to go?
L221125	u955	m62	FRANCES	What do I do, Dad?
L221068	u953	m62	ERNEST	Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
L221067	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
L221047	u955	m62	FRANCES	And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
L221046	u953	m62	ERNEST	I know.
L221045	u955	m62	FRANCES	It's already started, Dad... with me.
L221043	u955	m62	FRANCES	He's a socialist, then?
L221042	u953	m62	ERNEST	No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
L221041	u955	m62	FRANCES	Is Kaminski a Communist?
L221040	u953	m62	ERNEST	Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
L221039	u955	m62	FRANCES	He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
L221038	u953	m62	ERNEST	Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
L221037	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
L221036	u953	m62	ERNEST	You wrote it, didn't you?
L221035	u955	m62	FRANCES	I didn't have much to do with it.
L221034	u953	m62	ERNEST	An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
L221033	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thanks, Dad.
L221032	u953	m62	ERNEST	I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
L220966	u955	m62	FRANCES	See you next weekend, Dad.
L220965	u953	m62	ERNEST	Bye, baby.
L221064	u953	m62	ERNEST	That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
L221063	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
L221062	u953	m62	ERNEST	Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
L221061	u962	m62	LILLIAN	As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
L221060	u953	m62	ERNEST	See you next weekend?
L221059	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Good.
L221058	u953	m62	ERNEST	I'm going back to the hotel.
L221057	u962	m62	LILLIAN	That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
L221056	u953	m62	ERNEST	No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
L221055	u962	m62	LILLIAN	How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
L221054	u953	m62	ERNEST	They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
L221053	u962	m62	LILLIAN	You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
L221052	u953	m62	ERNEST	I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
L221051	u962	m62	LILLIAN	You're poisoning that child's mind.
L221029	u962	m62	LILLIAN	When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
L221028	u953	m62	ERNEST	Thank you.
L221027	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Bread?
L221026	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
L221025	u953	m62	ERNEST	It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
L221178	u954	m62	FIRE CHIEF	Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
L221177	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh, Kurt!
L221176	u954	m62	FIRE CHIEF	No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
L221175	u955	m62	FRANCES	But, Kurt, I...
L221174	u954	m62	FIRE CHIEF	Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
L221173	u955	m62	FRANCES	Kurt!
L221595	u966	m62	SERGEANT	Occupation?
L221594	u955	m62	FRANCES	Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
L221593	u966	m62	SERGEANT	Address?
L221592	u955	m62	FRANCES	Fifteen.
L221591	u966	m62	SERGEANT	Age?
L221590	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
L221589	u966	m62	SERGEANT	Name?
L221418	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
L221417	u955	m62	FRANCES	Just one minute...
L221415	u955	m62	FRANCES	Why, you... you little bastard!
L221414	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
L221413	u955	m62	FRANCES	What is this?
L221412	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
L221411	u955	m62	FRANCES	What?
L221410	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	What about your husband?
L221409	u955	m62	FRANCES	They'll mend.
L221408	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
L221407	u955	m62	FRANCES	...Not if I can help it.
L221406	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Aren't you ever going back?
L221405	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, I don't hate it.
L221404	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	You sound as if you hate it.
L221403	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
L221402	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Why?
L221401	u955	m62	FRANCES	Then don't go to Hollywood.
L221400	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Why... yes.
L221399	u955	m62	FRANCES	Are you really serious? About acting?
L221398	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
L221397	u955	m62	FRANCES	Are you an actor?
L221396	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
L221395	u955	m62	FRANCES	I wouldn't miss it.
L221394	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	Only if you were in it. Are you?
L221393	u955	m62	FRANCES	You can always come see it in London.
L221392	u969	m62	YOUNG MAN	I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
L222079	u956	m62	HARRY	Just a little way.
L222078	u955	m62	FRANCES	That would be okay.
L222077	u956	m62	HARRY	Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
L222076	u955	m62	FRANCES	Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
L222075	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, we're not.
L222074	u956	m62	HARRY	No.
L222073	u955	m62	FRANCES	Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
L222072	u956	m62	HARRY	I'm not sure.
L222071	u955	m62	FRANCES	It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
L222068	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
L222067	u956	m62	HARRY	Why do you say that?
L222066	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
L222065	u956	m62	HARRY	Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
L222064	u955	m62	FRANCES	I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
L222063	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well... you're looking well.
L222062	u956	m62	HARRY	Oh, you...  ...ennh.
L222061	u955	m62	FRANCES	How did I look?
L222060	u956	m62	HARRY	Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
L222059	u955	m62	FRANCES	Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
L222058	u956	m62	HARRY	How... how ya doin', Farmer?
L222057	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
L222056	u956	m62	HARRY	C'mere. I want to talk to you.
L221970	u956	m62	HARRY	I hope so, Frances.
L221969	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
L221968	u956	m62	HARRY	Right. Except... time has a way of --
L221967	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
L221966	u956	m62	HARRY	I don't know.
L221965	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
L221964	u956	m62	HARRY	Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
L221962	u955	m62	FRANCES	I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
L221961	u956	m62	HARRY	You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
L221960	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah. I don't know.
L221959	u956	m62	HARRY	This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
L221958	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh Harry...
L221957	u956	m62	HARRY	Where to?
L221938	u956	m62	HARRY	I love you too, Frances.
L221937	u955	m62	FRANCES	I love you, Harry. I love you.
L221917	u955	m62	FRANCES	...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
L221916	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances, it's me, Harry?
L221915	u955	m62	FRANCES	Who?
L221914	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances! Frances!
L221794	u955	m62	FRANCES	I got your number, Mister Man.
L221793	u956	m62	HARRY	Anyway... if you need me...
L221792	u955	m62	FRANCES	I know. Don't tell anyone.
L221791	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances, You're crazy.
L221790	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
L221789	u956	m62	HARRY	You give up on her?
L221788	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
L221787	u956	m62	HARRY	It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
L221786	u956	m62	HARRY	Will you marry me?
L221785	u955	m62	FRANCES	What's that?
L221784	u956	m62	HARRY	There's just one more thing.
L221783	u956	m62	HARRY	Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
L221782	u955	m62	FRANCES	I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
L221781	u956	m62	HARRY	Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
L221780	u955	m62	FRANCES	You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
L221779	u956	m62	HARRY	Huh?
L221778	u955	m62	FRANCES	Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
L221775	u956	m62	HARRY	No. To thoroughbreds.
L221774	u955	m62	FRANCES	To quarter-horses.
L221773	u956	m62	HARRY	Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
L221772	u955	m62	FRANCES	What a man!
L221771	u956	m62	HARRY	Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
L221770	u955	m62	FRANCES	Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
L221769	u955	m62	FRANCES	You can't drink.
L221768	u956	m62	HARRY	What's that?
L221767	u955	m62	FRANCES	Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
L221766	u956	m62	HARRY	I guess.
L221765	u955	m62	FRANCES	You know something, Harry?
L221764	u956	m62	HARRY	Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
L221763	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
L221762	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
L221761	u955	m62	FRANCES	Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
L221759	u955	m62	FRANCES	A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
L221758	u956	m62	HARRY	Huh?
L221757	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
L221756	u956	m62	HARRY	Whattaya think you're in now?
L221755	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
L221754	u955	m62	FRANCES	...Take advantage of me.
L221753	u956	m62	HARRY	That's right.
L221752	u955	m62	FRANCES	This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
L221751	u956	m62	HARRY	What?
L221750	u955	m62	FRANCES	I should've known...
L221749	u956	m62	HARRY	Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
L221748	u955	m62	FRANCES	Where are we, mean man?
L221747	u955	m62	FRANCES	Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
L221746	u956	m62	HARRY	Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
L221745	u955	m62	FRANCES	That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
L221744	u956	m62	HARRY	Evening, gorgeous.
L221731	u956	m62	HARRY	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
L221730	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh my God, I look awful.
L221556	u955	m62	FRANCES	Who said I was a lady?
L221555	u956	m62	HARRY	Take a walk, pal.
L221549	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
L221548	u956	m62	HARRY	And?
L221547	u955	m62	FRANCES	I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
L221545	u956	m62	HARRY	You're coming.
L221544	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, Harry, I can't -- 
L221543	u956	m62	HARRY	Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
L221541	u956	m62	HARRY	Beats me.
L221540	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
L221539	u956	m62	HARRY	So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
L221538	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
L221537	u956	m62	HARRY	I'll bet.
L221536	u955	m62	FRANCES	I took the early rounds.
L221535	u956	m62	HARRY	Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
L221534	u956	m62	HARRY	Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
L221533	u955	m62	FRANCES	For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
L221532	u956	m62	HARRY	What for?
L221531	u955	m62	FRANCES	Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
L221530	u956	m62	HARRY	Nice joint. Can you afford it?
L221528	u955	m62	FRANCES	Help yourself. Everyone else has.
L221527	u956	m62	HARRY	Think I'll have a glass.
L221526	u955	m62	FRANCES	What's left of my blood.
L221525	u956	m62	HARRY	Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
L221524	u955	m62	FRANCES	How the hell do you find me anyway?
L221463	u955	m62	FRANCES	Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
L221462	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances...
L221461	u955	m62	FRANCES	Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
L221460	u955	m62	FRANCES	Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
L221459	u956	m62	HARRY	Calm down, Frances.
L221458	u955	m62	FRANCES	I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
L221457	u956	m62	HARRY	Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
L221456	u955	m62	FRANCES	Harry? Harry, where are you?!
L221291	u955	m62	FRANCES	I know.
L221290	u956	m62	HARRY	I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
L221289	u955	m62	FRANCES	He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
L221288	u956	m62	HARRY	The chauffeur. He's watching.
L221287	u955	m62	FRANCES	It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
L221286	u956	m62	HARRY	Don't start, Farmer.
L221284	u956	m62	HARRY	Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
L221283	u955	m62	FRANCES	The hell you will, Harry York.
L221282	u956	m62	HARRY	Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
L221281	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
L221280	u956	m62	HARRY	What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
L221279	u955	m62	FRANCES	But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
L221278	u956	m62	HARRY	Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
L221277	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
L221276	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
L221275	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, they don't, do they?
L221274	u956	m62	HARRY	If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
L221273	u955	m62	FRANCES	You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
L221272	u955	m62	FRANCES	Forget it.
L221271	u956	m62	HARRY	Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
L221270	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
L221269	u956	m62	HARRY	You're telling me.
L221268	u955	m62	FRANCES	Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
L221267	u956	m62	HARRY	Is that why you did it?
L221266	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well, the studio told me not to.
L221265	u956	m62	HARRY	Shit. I meant the other way around.
L221210	u956	m62	HARRY	Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
L221209	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah.
L221208	u956	m62	HARRY	Serious, huh?
L221205	u956	m62	HARRY	Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
L221204	u955	m62	FRANCES	Harry... I met someone.
L221203	u956	m62	HARRY	Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
L221202	u955	m62	FRANCES	I know what ability you're interested in.
L221201	u956	m62	HARRY	I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
L221200	u955	m62	FRANCES	Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
L221199	u955	m62	FRANCES	You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
L221198	u956	m62	HARRY	He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
L221197	u955	m62	FRANCES	But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
L221196	u956	m62	HARRY	Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
L221195	u955	m62	FRANCES	Jesus.
L221194	u956	m62	HARRY	Eight stories.
L221193	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh no...
L221192	u956	m62	HARRY	They killed him. They threw him out that window.
L221191	u955	m62	FRANCES	What?
L221190	u956	m62	HARRY	Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
L221189	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
L221188	u956	m62	HARRY	Kaminski.
L221187	u955	m62	FRANCES	Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
L221186	u956	m62	HARRY	Came to get a tan.
L221185	u955	m62	FRANCES	Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
L221184	u956	m62	HARRY	How ya doin', Farmer?
L221111	u955	m62	FRANCES	Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
L221110	u956	m62	HARRY	Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
L221109	u955	m62	FRANCES	What?
L221108	u956	m62	HARRY	Frances...
L221106	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah.
L221105	u956	m62	HARRY	You don't know what you want.
L221104	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
L221103	u956	m62	HARRY	Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
L221102	u955	m62	FRANCES	...So you think I should go.
L221101	u956	m62	HARRY	I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
L221100	u956	m62	HARRY	He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
L221099	u955	m62	FRANCES	What happened to him?
L221098	u956	m62	HARRY	You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
L221097	u956	m62	HARRY	You're not the quiet type, Frances.
L221096	u955	m62	FRANCES	Quietly.
L221095	u956	m62	HARRY	What?
L221094	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
L221093	u956	m62	HARRY	Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
L221092	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
L221091	u956	m62	HARRY	Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
L221089	u956	m62	HARRY	You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
L221088	u955	m62	FRANCES	Don't be a rat, Harry.
L221087	u956	m62	HARRY	Enh.
L221086	u955	m62	FRANCES	How'd I look?
L221085	u956	m62	HARRY	I just wanted to see how you looked.
L221084	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well? What'd you think?
L221083	u956	m62	HARRY	You think I'd miss it?
L221082	u955	m62	FRANCES	Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
L221014	u955	m62	FRANCES	Harry.
L221013	u956	m62	HARRY	Harry.
L221012	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
L221011	u956	m62	HARRY	I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
L221010	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
L221009	u956	m62	HARRY	Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
L221008	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
L221007	u956	m62	HARRY	Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
L221006	u955	m62	FRANCES	But I'm not. The newspapers're --
L221005	u956	m62	HARRY	Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
L221004	u955	m62	FRANCES	Whattaya mean?
L221003	u956	m62	HARRY	Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
L221002	u955	m62	FRANCES	You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
L221001	u956	m62	HARRY	Yeah, well --
L221000	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
L220999	u956	m62	HARRY	Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
L220998	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
L220996	u955	m62	FRANCES	No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
L220995	u956	m62	HARRY	Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
L220994	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
L220993	u956	m62	HARRY	Not me. But other people seem to.
L220992	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
L220991	u956	m62	HARRY	Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
L220990	u955	m62	FRANCES	Okay then...
L220989	u956	m62	HARRY	I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
L220988	u955	m62	FRANCES	Don't touch me.
L220987	u956	m62	HARRY	Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
L221990	u957	m62	HITCHHIKER	Run!
L221989	u955	m62	FRANCES	Shit!
L221985	u955	m62	FRANCES	You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
L221984	u957	m62	HITCHHIKER	What'd you do?
L221983	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah.
L221980	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
L221979	u957	m62	HITCHHIKER	Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
L221978	u955	m62	FRANCES	Wherever they're going, I'm going.
L221977	u957	m62	HITCHHIKER	Where you goin'?
L221976	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yes.
L221975	u957	m62	HITCHHIKER	And no people.
L221974	u955	m62	FRANCES	It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
L221973	u957	m62	HITCHHIKER	Pretty morning.
L221618	u958	m62	JUDGE	You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
L221617	u955	m62	FRANCES	Fine!
L221616	u958	m62	JUDGE	Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
L221612	u958	m62	JUDGE	Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
L221611	u955	m62	FRANCES	Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
L221610	u958	m62	JUDGE	Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
L221609	u955	m62	FRANCES	That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
L221608	u958	m62	JUDGE	You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
L221607	u955	m62	FRANCES	Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
L221606	u958	m62	JUDGE	Did you expect him to look you up?
L221605	u955	m62	FRANCES	I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
L221604	u958	m62	JUDGE	Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
L221603	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
L221602	u958	m62	JUDGE	Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
L221601	u955	m62	FRANCES	Who's writing this guy's lines?
L221600	u958	m62	JUDGE	...Is that not true?
L221565	u963	m62	MAN	I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
L221564	u955	m62	FRANCES	What?
L221563	u963	m62	MAN	You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
L221562	u955	m62	FRANCES	I live here.
L221561	u963	m62	MAN	Who're you?
L221560	u955	m62	FRANCES	What happened? Who're you?
L221428	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
L221427	u964	m62	ODETS	You got it.
L221426	u955	m62	FRANCES	You think I got it?
L221425	u964	m62	ODETS	The speech? Real good.
L221424	u955	m62	FRANCES	How's it sound?
L221423	u964	m62	ODETS	I already have.
L221422	u955	m62	FRANCES	"'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, ""This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!"" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'"
L221421	u964	m62	ODETS	Your big speech?
L221420	u955	m62	FRANCES	'But how do I know you love me?'
L221362	u964	m62	ODETS	Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
L221361	u955	m62	FRANCES	Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
L221360	u964	m62	ODETS	I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
L221359	u955	m62	FRANCES	But I want to. I'm trying!
L221358	u964	m62	ODETS	Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
L221357	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm not!
L221356	u964	m62	ODETS	I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
L221355	u955	m62	FRANCES	That's me, Clifford.
L221350	u964	m62	ODETS	'Golden Boy.'
L221349	u955	m62	FRANCES	And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
L222009	u955	m62	FRANCES	No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
L222008	u962	m62	LILLIAN	But what -- 
L222007	u955	m62	FRANCES	No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
L222006	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I have!
L222005	u955	m62	FRANCES	You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
L222004	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
L222003	u955	m62	FRANCES	Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
L221955	u955	m62	FRANCES	I will, I promise.
L221954	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
L221953	u955	m62	FRANCES	Thank you for understanding, Mama.
L221952	u962	m62	LILLIAN	You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
L221951	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
L221950	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Oh, just leave those things for now.
L221945	u955	m62	FRANCES	No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
L221944	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
L221864	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Frances!
L221863	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
L221862	u962	m62	LILLIAN	You're not going anywhere!
L221861	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm going out!
L221860	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Where are you going?
L221859	u955	m62	FRANCES	You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
L221858	u962	m62	LILLIAN	And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
L221857	u955	m62	FRANCES	Mama, shut up!
L221856	u962	m62	LILLIAN	You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
L221855	u955	m62	FRANCES	No!
L221854	u962	m62	LILLIAN	You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
L221853	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
L221852	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
L221851	u955	m62	FRANCES	Haven't you heard what I said?
L221850	u962	m62	LILLIAN	They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
L221849	u955	m62	FRANCES	Mama...?
L221848	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Don't... talk crazy.
L221847	u955	m62	FRANCES	Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
L221846	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
L221845	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm back, Mama.
L221833	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yes, Mama.
L221832	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I don't want you drinking, Frances.
L221831	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yes, Mama.
L221830	u962	m62	LILLIAN	You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
L221829	u955	m62	FRANCES	I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
L221828	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Say you promise.
L221827	u955	m62	FRANCES	Sure.
L221826	u962	m62	LILLIAN	At one. Promise?
L221825	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'll be back.
L221824	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I'll have lunch ready by one.
L221823	u955	m62	FRANCES	Not long.
L221822	u962	m62	LILLIAN	How long will you be?
L221821	u955	m62	FRANCES	For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
L221820	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Where are you going?
L221819	u955	m62	FRANCES	Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
L221818	u962	m62	LILLIAN	What's wrong?
L221817	u955	m62	FRANCES	I think I need a little air.
L221815	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
L221814	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
L221797	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
L221796	u955	m62	FRANCES	Well, who have we here...?
L221700	u955	m62	FRANCES	Go on...
L221699	u962	m62	LILLIAN	What?
L221698	u955	m62	FRANCES	You kill me, Mama.
L221697	u962	m62	LILLIAN	It's your fan mail, little sister.
L221696	u955	m62	FRANCES	Then why did you bring them?
L221695	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
L221694	u955	m62	FRANCES	Why are these all opened?
L221693	u962	m62	LILLIAN	And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
L221686	u955	m62	FRANCES	Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
L221685	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
L221638	u955	m62	FRANCES	You're taking me home!
L221637	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
L221636	u955	m62	FRANCES	Mama, what's...
L221635	u962	m62	LILLIAN	It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
L221249	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Smile, little sister, smile.
L221248	u955	m62	FRANCES	It's okay.
L221124	u962	m62	LILLIAN	...You will.
L221123	u955	m62	FRANCES	I don't care.
L221122	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
L221121	u955	m62	FRANCES	It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
L221117	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
L221116	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
L221115	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
L221114	u962	m62	LILLIAN	But they're using you!
L221050	u962	m62	LILLIAN	And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
L221049	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yes, Ma.
L221048	u962	m62	LILLIAN	Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
L221031	u962	m62	LILLIAN	I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
L221030	u955	m62	FRANCES	Mama...
L221261	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh bullshit.
L221260	u959	m62	JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE	No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
L221259	u955	m62	FRANCES	Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
L221258	u959	m62	JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE	I don't believe so.
L221257	u955	m62	FRANCES	Don't I know you?
L221256	u959	m62	JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE	Yes...?
L221255	u955	m62	FRANCES	Excuse me.
L221254	u959	m62	JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE	On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
L221728	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Sedate her.
L221727	u955	m62	FRANCES	Symington says...
L221725	u955	m62	FRANCES	No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
L221724	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Frances, I'm warning you...
L221723	u955	m62	FRANCES	I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
L221722	u955	m62	FRANCES	'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
L221721	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Huh?
L221720	u955	m62	FRANCES	Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
L221719	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
L221718	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
L221717	u955	m62	FRANCES	You what?
L221716	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
L221715	u955	m62	FRANCES	Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
L221714	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
L221713	u955	m62	FRANCES	I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
L221712	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh for Christ's...
L221711	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
L221710	u955	m62	FRANCES	I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
L221709	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	"She told me you said, ""Mama, you want to kill me."""
L221708	u955	m62	FRANCES	What?
L221707	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
L221706	u955	m62	FRANCES	No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
L221705	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	You're telling me you feel guilty.
L221704	u955	m62	FRANCES	Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
L221703	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Really? Any problems?
L221702	u955	m62	FRANCES	Yes. It was very good to see her.
L221701	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
L221678	u955	m62	FRANCES	You didn't say 'Symington says'.
L221677	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Is there something else?
L221675	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
L221674	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	I'll have someone show you to your room.
L221673	u955	m62	FRANCES	"No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, ""Doctor?"""
L221672	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Stay calm, please.
L221671	u955	m62	FRANCES	This whole thing is a joke!
L221670	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
L221669	u955	m62	FRANCES	...Did you really say that?
L221668	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
L221667	u955	m62	FRANCES	Normal. Average.
L221666	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	And what's that?
L221665	u955	m62	FRANCES	Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
L221664	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	I see.
L221663	u955	m62	FRANCES	You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
L221662	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Please sit down...
L221661	u955	m62	FRANCES	Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
L221660	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
L221659	u955	m62	FRANCES	Oh! Are you really?
L221657	u955	m62	FRANCES	Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
L221656	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
L221655	u955	m62	FRANCES	It ain't for lack of trying.
L221654	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
L221653	u955	m62	FRANCES	Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
L221652	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	Thanks are hardly necessary.
L221651	u955	m62	FRANCES	Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
L221650	u967	m62	SYMINGTON	I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
L220977	u960	m62	KAMINSKI	Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
L220976	u968	m62	YORK & CROWD	No! No!
L220975	u960	m62	KAMINSKI	Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
L220974	u968	m62	YORK & CROWD	No!
L220973	u960	m62	KAMINSKI	Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
L220972	u968	m62	YORK & CROWD	No!
L220971	u960	m62	KAMINSKI	And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
L222021	u965	m62	OLDER NURSE	'Incurable.'
L222020	u970	m62	YOUNG NURSE	What?
L222019	u965	m62	OLDER NURSE	Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
L222018	u970	m62	YOUNG NURSE	You're kidding.
L222017	u965	m62	OLDER NURSE	I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
L222016	u970	m62	YOUNG NURSE	Yeah?
L222015	u965	m62	OLDER NURSE	I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
L303971	u1485	m101	BARBARA	In the backyard.
L303970	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Where?
L303969	u1485	m101	BARBARA	I heard them.
L303968	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
L303967	u1485	m101	BARBARA	What's that outside, Daddy?
L303966	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Hey, baby. What's wrong?
L303715	u1485	m101	BARBARA	Can I go over to Janeane's house?
L303714	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Instant rice...?
L303713	u1485	m101	BARBARA	I'll take some.
L303702	u1510	m101	WIGAND	"Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs ""don't breathe any more of that dust in.""  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?"
L303701	u1485	m101	BARBARA	She was playing with the Pooh doll.
L303700	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
L303698	u1485	m101	BARBARA	She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
L303697	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
L303692	u1485	m101	BARBARA	Okay.
L303691	u1510	m101	WIGAND	That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
L303690	u1485	m101	BARBARA	For reading.
L303689	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Yeah? What for?
L303688	u1485	m101	BARBARA	Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
L303687	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What's new?
L303686	u1485	m101	BARBARA	Hi, Daddy.
L303685	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Hi, honey.
L304485	u1485	m101	BARBARA	There's Dad, on TV.
L304484	u1497	m101	LIANE	Yes, baby?
L304483	u1485	m101	BARBARA	Mom.
L304482	u1497	m101	LIANE	Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
L304481	u1485	m101	BARBARA	Yeah.
L304480	u1497	m101	LIANE	That remote control thing?
L304479	u1485	m101	BARBARA	He's into kind of little cars, that...
L304571	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You got a deal. 
L304570	u1486	m101	BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE	Three hours.
L304569	u1499	m101	LOWELL	How long?
L304568	u1486	m101	BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE	We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
L304565	u1486	m101	BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE	Lowell?
L304564	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Just ran into two of your ""geologists."" Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?"
L304130	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
L304129	u1486	m101	BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE	Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
L304476	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
L304475	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
L304474	u1499	m101	LOWELL	These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
L304446	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah. Catch you later.
L304445	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	Are you all right?
L304444	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
L304443	u1499	m101	LOWELL	And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
L304442	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
L304441	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
L304440	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
L304439	u1499	m101	LOWELL	It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
L304438	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	What? Forget it.
L304437	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Push it.
L304436	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	Monday.
L304435	u1499	m101	LOWELL	When's your deadline?
L304420	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	I'll be there.
L304419	u1499	m101	LOWELL	P.J.'s.
L304418	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	Sure. Where?
L304417	u1499	m101	LOWELL	We gotta hook up.
L304416	u1487	m101	CHARLIE PHILLIPS	You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
L304415	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
L304632	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	"The sub-heading is, ""Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic."" It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it ""the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."""
L304631	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Good.
L304630	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
L304592	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
L304591	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
L304382	u1499	m101	LOWELL	...fuck is this? Fuck!
L304381	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	Sure.
L304380	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Get me Wigand.
L304379	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	What was that about?
L304263	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
L304262	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
L304261	u1499	m101	LOWELL	When's the air date?
L304079	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
L304078	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	Alright, alright.
L304077	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
L304076	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	I don't know what he was thinking.
L304075	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
L304074	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Shit...
L303951	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
L303950	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
L303949	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What do you mean, what's it do?
L303948	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	What does that do?
L303844	u1488	m101	DEBBIE DELUCA	Okay.
L303843	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
L304082	u1489	m101	DEBORAH	Oh, I love that stuff.
L304081	u1497	m101	LIANE	I'm cooking pasta primavera.
L304080	u1489	m101	DEBORAH	What are you cooking?
L303712	u1497	m101	LIANE	How about you?
L303711	u1489	m101	DEBORAH	Maybe later.
L303710	u1497	m101	LIANE	Do you want more rice?
L303705	u1497	m101	LIANE	...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
L303704	u1489	m101	DEBORAH	Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
L304636	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
L304635	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
L304458	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
L304457	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
L304456	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
L304455	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
L304454	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	What the hell are you doing?
L304376	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
L304375	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
L304374	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	Then what are you going to do?
L304373	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"No. I'm not going to take ""no"" for an answer. No."
L304372	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	"You're taking ""no"" for an answer?"
L304371	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
L304370	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	So, what are you going to do?
L304326	u1499	m101	LOWELL	C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
L304325	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
L304324	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
L304323	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	You're exaggerating!
L304322	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear ""reasonable"" and ""tortious interference."" I hear... ""Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse."" I hear... ""Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!"" That's what I hear."
L304321	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
L304320	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
L304319	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
L304316	u1499	m101	LOWELL	It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
L304315	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	Yeah, I heard rumors.
L304310	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
L304309	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on ""60 Minutes""?"
L304295	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	Lunch?
L304294	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Tortious interference? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
L304258	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of ""Kools"" to the world.  ""Sealed"" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive."
L304257	u1490	m101	DON HEWITT	I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
L304318	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  ""Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."""
L304317	u1491	m101	ERIC KLUSTER	And what are you implying?
L304312	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Before you go...
L304311	u1491	m101	ERIC KLUSTER	So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
L304308	u1491	m101	ERIC KLUSTER	We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
L304307	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No, I'm not...
L304306	u1491	m101	ERIC KLUSTER	I'm afraid you are.
L304305	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I'm not touching my film...
L304304	u1491	m101	ERIC KLUSTER	That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
L304303	u1499	m101	LOWELL	So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
L304302	u1491	m101	ERIC KLUSTER	There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
L304126	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	You alright, Mr. Wigand?
L304125	u1510	m101	WIGAND	That computer has everything...
L304123	u1510	m101	WIGAND	...my files! Personal correspondence...
L304122	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
L304121	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You can't take that... It's personal property...!
L304117	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
L304116	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
L304115	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
L304114	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
L304111	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
L304110	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
L304109	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
L304108	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
L304107	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What caliber is my gun?
L304106	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	What caliber is your gun?
L304105	u1510	m101	WIGAND	A gun? Yes.
L304102	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Yes, I'm afraid I did.
L304101	u1492	m101	FBI AGENT #2	Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
L303841	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Catch ya' later.
L303840	u1493	m101	FELLING	Okay. 
L303839	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I'm gonna do a follow-up.
L303838	u1493	m101	FELLING	What about you, you got a crew already?
L303837	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
L303836	u1493	m101	FELLING	Hey, Lowell.
L303835	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Debbie...
L304471	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Mike?
L304470	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	Mike... Mike... Mike...
L304290	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
L304289	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	How grave?
L304288	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
L304267	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	Are you sure?
L304266	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	No, no, we're fine...
L304265	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
L304293	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
L304292	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
L304286	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Is this ""Alice in Wonderland""?"
L304285	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
L304284	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Come again?
L304283	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
L304282	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Well, as a ""standard""... I'll hang with ""is the guy telling the truth?"""
L304281	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
L304280	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"His ""veracity"" was good enough for the State of Mississippi."
L304279	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	"And, I'm told there are questions as to our ""star witness'"" veracity."
L304278	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
L304277	u1494	m101	HELEN CAPERELLI	I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
L304276	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"What does that mean? ""Rife with -- ?"""
L304586	u1495	m101	JIM COOPER	Call me back in ten.
L304585	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
L304584	u1495	m101	JIM COOPER	Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
L304583	u1499	m101	LOWELL	How prominent? What kind of placement?
L304434	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Catch you later.
L304433	u1495	m101	JIM COOPER	Hi, baby.
L304431	u1495	m101	JIM COOPER	Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
L304430	u1499	m101	LOWELL	How are you, Jim?
L304429	u1495	m101	JIM COOPER	Hey, Lowell.
L304606	u1496	m101	JIM COOPER'S VOICE	No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
L304605	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Did I tell you you were wrong?
L304604	u1496	m101	JIM COOPER'S VOICE	Lowell?
L304603	u1496	m101	JIM COOPER'S VOICE	Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
L304602	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You ready...?
L304601	u1496	m101	JIM COOPER'S VOICE	Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
L304600	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Why?
L304599	u1496	m101	JIM COOPER'S VOICE	You're sure you want to do this?
L304598	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah?
L304597	u1496	m101	JIM COOPER'S VOICE	Okay.  Lowell?
L304596	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
L304579	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Jim, it's Lowell.
L304578	u1496	m101	JIM COOPER'S VOICE	Hello?
L304201	u1497	m101	LIANE	Yes... Jeffrey.
L304200	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Can we talk about this when I get back?
L304199	u1497	m101	LIANE	I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
L304197	u1497	m101	LIANE	That's for food.
L304196	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What's the difference...
L304195	u1497	m101	LIANE	Use the bathroom.
L304194	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Where should I wash them?
L304193	u1497	m101	LIANE	Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
L304142	u1497	m101	LIANE	An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
L304141	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I'm doing an interview.
L304140	u1497	m101	LIANE	...taping?  What are you taping?
L304120	u1497	m101	LIANE	"I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the ""F"" up, they were going to kill you..."
L304119	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What's going on?
L303732	u1497	m101	LIANE	No, thank you.
L303731	u1510	m101	WIGAND	There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
L303730	u1497	m101	LIANE	What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
L303729	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Thomas Sandefur...
L303728	u1497	m101	LIANE	Why? Who said?
L303727	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
L303726	u1497	m101	LIANE	I don't understand.
L303725	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I didn't want to leave it there...
L303724	u1497	m101	LIANE	Why did you take your stuff from the office?
L303723	u1510	m101	WIGAND	That's my stuff from the office...
L303722	u1497	m101	LIANE	Right now?
L303721	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Soy sauce...
L303720	u1497	m101	LIANE	What do you need at the store?
L303719	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I'm going to the store. You need anything?
L303718	u1497	m101	LIANE	Uh, what are those boxes?
L303717	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Try the car.
L303716	u1497	m101	LIANE	I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
L303709	u1497	m101	LIANE	Yes, it's on the stove...
L303708	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Is there any more rice...?
L303707	u1497	m101	LIANE	Don't you have to be at the office?
L303706	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I can take her.
L303793	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yes.
L303792	u1498	m101	LIANE'S VOICE	60 Minutes, the television show?
L303791	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah.
L303790	u1498	m101	LIANE'S VOICE	60 Minutes?
L303789	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with ""60 Minutes""..."
L303788	u1498	m101	LIANE'S VOICE	Did you say Berman?
L303787	u1499	m101	LOWELL	My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --

L303785	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Thank you, Bob.
L304545	u1505	m101	SHARON	You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
L304544	u1499	m101	LOWELL	From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
L304543	u1505	m101	SHARON	No, you do not.
L304542	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I got perspective.
L304541	u1505	m101	SHARON	Get some perspective, Lowell.
L304540	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
L304539	u1505	m101	SHARON	So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
L304538	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.' You know, you take the ""60 Minutes"" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? ""60 Minutes""? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it."
L304342	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Jeffrey...

L304338	u1505	m101	SHARON	What are you and Mike going to do?
L304337	u1499	m101	LOWELL	They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
L304336	u1505	m101	SHARON	What?!
L304335	u1499	m101	LOWELL	They're killing the Wigand interview...
L304334	u1505	m101	SHARON	What's wrong?
L303778	u1505	m101	SHARON	I have to take a shower.
L303777	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"...it's anonymous. References to ""P.M.""  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?"

L303770	u1505	m101	SHARON	Hello? Yeah...
L303769	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Will independent sources corroborate that?
L303765	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
L303764	u1505	m101	SHARON	No classes this morning?
L303761	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Let me call you back...

L304389	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!

L304553	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
L304552	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah, I'm here.

L304069	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
L304068	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
L304067	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
L304066	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
L304062	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
L304061	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
L304060	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
L304059	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	That's right...
L304058	u1499	m101	LOWELL	...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
L304054	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	I'll call you then.
L304053	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Area code 212-555-0199.
L304052	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Alright.
L304051	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
L304659	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
L304658	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
L304655	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Everything interests me.
L304654	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	That Canada story? Still interest you?
L304624	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
L304623	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Mike... in my...
L304621	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	"I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? ""In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?""  What ""future""? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone."
L304620	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
L304619	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
L304618	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
L304617	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Give me a break!
L304616	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, please, Mike...
L304615	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
L304614	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
L304613	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
L304612	u1499	m101	LOWELL	But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
L304611	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Yeah, that's right.
L304610	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, lots.
L304609	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
L304608	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
L304607	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Did I get you up?
L304503	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I think it was a disgrace.
L304502	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Alright. What did you think?
L304501	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I disappeared on you?
L304500	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
L304499	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah.
L304464	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	"Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is ""no."" I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made."
L304463	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
L304462	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
L304461	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
L304333	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	I'm with Don on this.
L304332	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What?
L304331	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Lowell!
L304330	u1499	m101	LOWELL	These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
L304329	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Lowell.
L304328	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Put the corporation at risk...? Give me a fucking break!
L304327	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Lowell.
L304314	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	What?
L304313	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
L304271	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
L304270	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
L304256	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Good.
L304255	u1499	m101	LOWELL	It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
L304147	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
L304146	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Who are these people?
L304145	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, man.
L304139	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
L304138	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
L304137	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Thank you for saying that...
L304135	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	How are the rooms? Comfortable?
L304134	u1499	m101	LOWELL	So, is everything okay?
L303944	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Oh, torture? Great ratings.
L303943	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were ""compelled""?"
L303942	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	What do you mean?
L303941	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
L303928	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What's this?
L303927	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	No shit.
L303926	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Hardly new news.
L303925	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	"Well, it isn't ""cigarettes are bad for you""..."
L303924	u1499	m101	LOWELL	The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
L303923	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	"What ""Seven Dwarfs?"""
L303922	u1499	m101	LOWELL	He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
L303834	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
L303833	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah.
L303832	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	You eating with us?
L303831	u1499	m101	LOWELL	...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
L303748	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
L303747	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
L303746	u1499	m101	LOWELL	We're there.
L303675	u1499	m101	LOWELL	That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
L303674	u1507	m101	THE SHEIKH	Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
L303672	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"No. We don't do that.  You've seen ""60 Minutes"" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America."
L303671	u1507	m101	THE SHEIKH	Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
L303670	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
L303669	u1507	m101	THE SHEIKH	Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
L303668	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What I've seen... I've liked.
L303667	u1507	m101	THE SHEIKH	How have you liked your stay?
L303666	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah... Thank you.
L303665	u1507	m101	THE SHEIKH	Coffee?
L304537	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yeah. Yeah, I will.
L304536	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You try and have a good time.
L304535	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
L304534	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Where are you, anyway?
L304531	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
L304530	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
L304529	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
L304528	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know. Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
L304527	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
L304526	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You greased the rails!
L304525	u1499	m101	LOWELL	That's bullshit, Jeff!
L304524	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You manipulated me into this...!
L304410	u1499	m101	LOWELL	And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
L304409	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
L304408	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I told the truth... I told the truth.
L304407	u1499	m101	LOWELL	That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
L304406	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
L304405	u1499	m101	LOWELL	That's not the point.
L304404	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What does this have to do with my testimony?
L304403	u1499	m101	LOWELL	That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
L304402	u1510	m101	WIGAND	A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
L304401	u1499	m101	LOWELL	ABC Telemarketing Company.
L304400	u1510	m101	WIGAND	ABC...?
L304399	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
L304398	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
L304397	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
L304396	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What?
L304395	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
L304394	u1510	m101	WIGAND	She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
L304393	u1499	m101	LOWELL	She sued you for back payments of child support?
L304392	u1510	m101	WIGAND	...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
L304391	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
L304390	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I told the truth!
L304386	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
L304385	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
L304355	u1510	m101	WIGAND	"I do not think that you ""know"" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day."
L304354	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No? No, what?
L304353	u1510	m101	WIGAND	No.
L304352	u1499	m101	LOWELL	B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
L304351	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What?!
L304350	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
L304253	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Run that Sandefur piece on ""nicotine's not addictive."" Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with ""I believe they perjured..."" Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word ""felt"" on the B-side..."
L304252	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within...
L304228	u1510	m101	WIGAND	No. I mean since whenever...
L304227	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You mean... since this morning?
L304226	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What's changed?
L304222	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I don't know what to do.
L304221	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
L304220	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Yeah, great.
L304219	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You attract a crowd.
L304189	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Did you have a good day?
L304188	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
L304187	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
L304186	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I heard.
L304185	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
L304182	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"...they ""volunteered."" A friend owns a large security company."
L304181	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Lowell, I can't afford --
L304144	u1510	m101	WIGAND	...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
L304143	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
L304100	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I'll call them, Lowell.
L304099	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Good. But Jeff...
L304096	u1510	m101	WIGAND	They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
L304095	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Jeff...
L304094	u1510	m101	WIGAND	They do this with impunity!
L304093	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Jeff, call the FBI right away...
L304090	u1510	m101	WIGAND	They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
L304089	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Excuse me. Yeah...
L304036	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
L304035	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
L304034	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or ""60 Minutes'"" with this cheap skepticism!"
L304033	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I don't think you really understand --
L304032	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
L304031	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
L304030	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Yes.
L304029	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
L304028	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
L304027	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You believe that?
L304026	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
L304025	u1510	m101	WIGAND	No.
L304024	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You believe that?
L304022	u1499	m101	LOWELL	...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
L304021	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
L304020	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
L304019	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
L304018	u1499	m101	LOWELL	They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
L304017	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Why?
L304016	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on ""60 Minutes,"" I got to know everything about why you got fired."
L304015	u1510	m101	WIGAND	My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
L304014	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You charge by the hour?
L304013	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
L304012	u1499	m101	LOWELL	My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
L304011	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Next to your father?
L304010	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
L304009	u1510	m101	WIGAND	The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
L304008	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Tempura...
L304007	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What did you get us?
L304004	u1499	m101	LOWELL	It's okay.
L304003	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
L304002	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Hello. You there
L304001	u1499	m101	LOWELL	It's obvious, isn't it?
L304000	u1510	m101	WIGAND	How'd you know that, Lowell?
L303999	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
L303998	u1510	m101	WIGAND	...okay.
L303997	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
L303996	u1510	m101	WIGAND	No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
L303985	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Good.  You have kids?
L303984	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
L303982	u1499	m101	LOWELL	You okay?
L303981	u1510	m101	WIGAND	The new place? New.
L303919	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
L303918	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
L303916	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
L303915	u1499	m101	LOWELL	"Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for ""tobacco"" in the first place?"
L303914	u1510	m101	WIGAND	It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
L303913	u1499	m101	LOWELL	...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
L303912	u1510	m101	WIGAND	The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
L303911	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Seven dwarfs?
L303908	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
L303907	u1510	m101	WIGAND	"Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the ""zone""...?"
L303906	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
L303905	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Like what?
L303904	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
L303903	u1510	m101	WIGAND	They should be.
L303902	u1499	m101	LOWELL	They're afraid of you, aren't they?
L303901	u1510	m101	WIGAND	And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
L303897	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
L303896	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You came all the way down here to tell me that?
L303895	u1499	m101	LOWELL	And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
L303894	u1510	m101	WIGAND	It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
L303893	u1499	m101	LOWELL	How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
L303892	u1510	m101	WIGAND	How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
L303891	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Why am I gonna mention your name?
L303890	u1510	m101	WIGAND	So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
L303889	u1499	m101	LOWELL	To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
L303888	u1510	m101	WIGAND	This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
L303887	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
L303886	u1510	m101	WIGAND	What do...
L303885	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Good. I want to talk to you.
L303884	u1499	m101	LOWELL	C'mere. I want to talk to you.
L303883	u1499	m101	LOWELL	I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
L303882	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Jump in, quick, c'mon...
L303881	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
L303877	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Fuck you, too!
L303876	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What are you talking about? Where are you?
L303875	u1510	m101	WIGAND	...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
L303827	u1499	m101	LOWELL	If you want to do it.
L303826	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Should I just take the documents now?
L303825	u1499	m101	LOWELL	That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
L303824	u1510	m101	WIGAND	How much would I get paid?
L303823	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Did work.
L303822	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Did work.
L303821	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
L303820	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
L303818	u1510	m101	WIGAND	This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
L303817	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Far as you go where?
L303816	u1510	m101	WIGAND	...but that's as far as I go...
L303812	u1510	m101	WIGAND	How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
L303811	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
L303810	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I know what I have to know.
L303809	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Like what? Your sign?
L303808	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
L303807	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Look, I really don't have that much time...
L303806	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Black, black...
L303805	u1499	m101	LOWELL	How do you like your coffee? Black?
L303803	u1499	m101	LOWELL	That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
L303802	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Who's that?
L304522	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
L304521	u1506	m101	THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE	I can't say that!
L304520	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
L304519	u1506	m101	THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE	He doesn't seem to be listening...
L304518	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What's happening?!
L304517	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Hello, can you hear me now?
L304516	u1506	m101	THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE	What?
L304515	u1499	m101	LOWELL	What about now?
L304514	u1506	m101	THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE	You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
L304513	u1499	m101	LOWELL	Did he hear you?
L304511	u1499	m101	LOWELL	No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
L304510	u1506	m101	THE HOTEL MANAGER'S VOICE	I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
L304349	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
L304348	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	Where you staying now?
L304347	u1510	m101	WIGAND	And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
L304346	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Liane has filed for divorce...
L304345	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	What do you mean there is no family?
L304344	u1510	m101	WIGAND	There is -- there is no family.
L304343	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
L304098	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
L304097	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
L304092	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
L304091	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	What are you talking about?
L303995	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	You called me.
L303994	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
L303992	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
L303991	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	Well, what do you really think, though?
L303990	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
L303989	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
L303988	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
L303987	u1510	m101	WIGAND	She's okay.
L303986	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
L303910	u1510	m101	WIGAND	For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
L303909	u1500	m101	LOWELL'S VOICE	Just give me an example...
L304210	u1501	m101	MICHAEL MOORE	Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
L304209	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
L304208	u1501	m101	MICHAEL MOORE	Right.
L304207	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
L304206	u1501	m101	MICHAEL MOORE	Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
L304205	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
L304647	u1510	m101	WIGAND	"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it... ""I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."""
L304646	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
L304498	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers...
L304497	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I would bet on it.
L304166	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
L304165	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
L304164	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Poor communication skills.
L304163	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
L304162	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Most certainly.
L304161	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
L304160	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
L304159	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
L304158	u1510	m101	WIGAND	"The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called ""coumarin."" When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen..."
L304157	u1510	m101	WIGAND	"The process is known as ""impact boosting..."" While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as ""ammonia chemistry."" It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system."
L304156	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
L304155	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You're gonna get your fix...
L304154	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
L304153	u1510	m101	WIGAND	A delivery device for nicotine.
L304152	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	And that's what cigarettes are for...?
L304151	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
L304150	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
L304149	u1510	m101	WIGAND	...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
L304148	u1502	m101	MIKE WALLACE	You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
L304249	u1503	m101	MOTLEY	Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
L304248	u1509	m101	TOBACCO LAWYER	Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
L304247	u1503	m101	MOTLEY	There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
L304246	u1509	m101	TOBACCO LAWYER	Object!
L304245	u1503	m101	MOTLEY	It acts as a...
L304244	u1509	m101	TOBACCO LAWYER	Object to the form!
L304243	u1503	m101	MOTLEY	It acts as a drug on the body?
L304242	u1509	m101	TOBACCO LAWYER	Object to the form of the question!
L304215	u1510	m101	WIGAND	"How does one... ""go... to... jail?"" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition..."
L304214	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
L304213	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Jail?
L304176	u1510	m101	WIGAND	When should we do this?
L304175	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
L304174	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
L304173	u1504	m101	RICHARD SCRUGGS	Hello.
L303863	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
L303862	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
L303861	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	That's why we hire scientists...
L303860	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Research...  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
L303859	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
L303858	u1510	m101	WIGAND	You threatening my family, now, too?
L303857	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
L303856	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Is that a threat?
L303855	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
L303854	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Chapter and verse.
L303853	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
L303852	u1510	m101	WIGAND	I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
L303851	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
L303850	u1510	m101	WIGAND	Seven...
L303849	u1508	m101	THOMAS SANDEFUR	Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
L328490	u1555	m104	AL	I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
L328489	u1568	m104	JIM	Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
L328460	u1555	m104	AL	Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc...
L328459	u1568	m104	JIM	William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
L328435	u1555	m104	AL	Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
L328434	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
L328433	u1555	m104	AL	"The U.S. Attorney in Washington ""declines"" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named."
L328316	u1568	m104	JIM	Not one word.  That's an order.
L328315	u1555	m104	AL	When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
L328314	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
L328228	u1555	m104	AL	My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
L328227	u1568	m104	JIM	Susie, watch the language, would you please.
L327970	u1568	m104	JIM	The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
L327969	u1555	m104	AL	If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
L327839	u1568	m104	JIM	Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
L327838	u1555	m104	AL	Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
L327895	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
L327894	u1568	m104	JIM	Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
L327893	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	There were no phone records.
L327892	u1568	m104	JIM	Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
L327891	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
L327890	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
L327889	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
L327888	u1568	m104	JIM	Recall any names?
L327887	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
L327886	u1568	m104	JIM	So you saw Oswald how many times?
L327885	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
L327884	u1568	m104	JIM	And Oswald?
L327883	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
L327882	u1568	m104	JIM	Did he pay?
L327881	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
L327880	u1568	m104	JIM	What was his voice like?
L327874	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
L327873	u1568	m104	JIM	Street cats?
L327872	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
L327871	u1568	m104	JIM	When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
L327870	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
L327869	u1568	m104	JIM	Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
L327867	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
L327866	u1568	m104	JIM	Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
L327865	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Right.
L327864	u1568	m104	JIM	"You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this ""Clay Bertrand"" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer."
L327863	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
L327862	u1568	m104	JIM	Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
L327861	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
L327533	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
L327532	u1557	m104	BANISTER	I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
L327531	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
L327530	u1557	m104	BANISTER	You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
L327529	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
L327528	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
L327527	u1557	m104	BANISTER	I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
L327526	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
L327525	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
L327524	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
L327523	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
L327522	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
L327513	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
L327512	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
L327511	u1557	m104	BANISTER	A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
L327510	u1577	m104	MARTIN	God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
L327509	u1557	m104	BANISTER	All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
L328472	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
L328471	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
L327998	u1586	m104	SUSIE	No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
L327997	u1558	m104	BILL	Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
L327996	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Who?
L327796	u1586	m104	SUSIE	You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
L327795	u1558	m104	BILL	Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
L327794	u1586	m104	SUSIE	I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
L327784	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
L327783	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
L328283	u1563	m104	FRANK	Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
L328282	u1558	m104	BILL	No, I'm not...
L328281	u1563	m104	FRANK	Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
L328280	u1563	m104	FRANK	Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
L328279	u1558	m104	BILL	Frank, I don't want to hear it.
L328278	u1563	m104	FRANK	You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
L328277	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah, I guess you do.
L328276	u1563	m104	FRANK	Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
L328275	u1558	m104	BILL	Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
L328274	u1563	m104	FRANK	It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
L328273	u1558	m104	BILL	Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
L328272	u1563	m104	FRANK	Bill.
L328447	u1574	m104	LOU	You're not digging.
L328446	u1558	m104	BILL	Keep saying what?
L328445	u1574	m104	LOU	You know you keep saying that.
L328444	u1558	m104	BILL	...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
L328443	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
L328266	u1558	m104	BILL	With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
L328265	u1574	m104	LOU	Not unless we go for Shaw now.
L328264	u1558	m104	BILL	The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
L328248	u1574	m104	LOU	Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
L328247	u1558	m104	BILL	"It's addressed to no one and no signature.  ""To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."""
L327842	u1558	m104	BILL	You, Numa?
L327841	u1574	m104	LOU	I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
L327840	u1558	m104	BILL	What do you think, Lou?
L327612	u1558	m104	BILL	Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
L327611	u1574	m104	LOU	Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
L327987	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
L327986	u1558	m104	BILL	So why does he call himself Bertrand?
L327985	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
L327984	u1558	m104	BILL	Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
L327983	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
L327982	u1558	m104	BILL	What's the other name?
L327981	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
L327980	u1558	m104	BILL	Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
L327979	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
L327925	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	"...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know ""beatnik"" type things."
L327924	u1558	m104	BILL	Go on, Willie.
L327923	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
L327916	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
L327915	u1558	m104	BILL	And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
L327914	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
L327911	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
L327910	u1558	m104	BILL	Did he pay you for this?
L327907	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
L327906	u1558	m104	BILL	Clay Bertrand, Willie?
L328484	u1558	m104	BILL	This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
L328483	u1568	m104	JIM	"Julius Caesar:  ""Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men.""  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA..."
L328482	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah.
L328481	u1568	m104	JIM	With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
L328480	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
L328479	u1568	m104	JIM	If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
L328478	u1558	m104	BILL	Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
L328477	u1568	m104	JIM	I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
L328476	u1558	m104	BILL	Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
L328475	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
L328474	u1558	m104	BILL	So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
L328473	u1568	m104	JIM	Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
L328470	u1568	m104	JIM	There's a word - orders.
L328469	u1558	m104	BILL	I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
L328271	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
L328270	u1558	m104	BILL	Where you going, boss?
L328269	u1568	m104	JIM	All right, all right.  Break it up.
L328257	u1568	m104	JIM	Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
L328256	u1558	m104	BILL	"Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  ""When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."""
L328224	u1558	m104	BILL	Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
L328223	u1568	m104	JIM	Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
L328187	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
L328186	u1558	m104	BILL	"That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a ""White Paper"" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss..."
L328002	u1568	m104	JIM	I think we should have him in for a little talk.
L328001	u1558	m104	BILL	That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
L328000	u1568	m104	JIM	Can you get some sworn statements?
L327837	u1568	m104	JIM	Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
L327836	u1558	m104	BILL	I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
L327833	u1568	m104	JIM	To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
L327832	u1558	m104	BILL	But why?
L327831	u1568	m104	JIM	"It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - ""a patsy"".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, ""O.H. Lee"" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?"
L327830	u1558	m104	BILL	He had his palm print on the weapon.
L327829	u1568	m104	JIM	I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
L327828	u1558	m104	BILL	And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
L327827	u1568	m104	JIM	We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
L327826	u1558	m104	BILL	I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
L327761	u1558	m104	BILL	Gee, thanks boss.
L327760	u1568	m104	JIM	The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
L327759	u1558	m104	BILL	And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
L327758	u1568	m104	JIM	When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
L327757	u1558	m104	BILL	He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
L327756	u1568	m104	JIM	Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
L327755	u1558	m104	BILL	Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
L327710	u1568	m104	JIM	No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
L327709	u1558	m104	BILL	Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
L327697	u1568	m104	JIM	Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
L327696	u1558	m104	BILL	What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
L327678	u1568	m104	JIM	Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
L327677	u1558	m104	BILL	At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
L327676	u1568	m104	JIM	Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
L327567	u1558	m104	BILL	The anonymous kind, Chief.
L327566	u1568	m104	JIM	Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
L328263	u1559	m104	CORONER	If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
L328262	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
L328261	u1559	m104	CORONER	Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
L328260	u1568	m104	JIM	Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
L328259	u1559	m104	CORONER	He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
L328258	u1568	m104	JIM	Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
L328246	u1559	m104	CORONER	I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
L328245	u1568	m104	JIM	What's it look like, Nick?
L328616	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
L328615	u1560	m104	DYMOND	I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
L328614	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
L328613	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Why?
L328612	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	I did.
L328611	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
L328642	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
L328641	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328640	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
L328639	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
L328638	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
L328637	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328636	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...ever called Dean Andrews?
L328635	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328634	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...Oswald?
L328163	u1561	m104	FERRIE	"They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out ""Alan Pope"" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called ""Mongoose""  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  ""Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."""
L328162	u1574	m104	LOU	What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
L328147	u1561	m104	FERRIE	"Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A ""wanna be,"" y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me."
L328146	u1574	m104	LOU	What do you mean?
L328145	u1561	m104	FERRIE	That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
L328144	u1574	m104	LOU	Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
L328143	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
L328142	u1574	m104	LOU	"Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I""m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready."
L328134	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
L328133	u1574	m104	LOU	Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
L328132	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
L328122	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
L328121	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
L328120	u1561	m104	FERRIE	...give me protection?
L328119	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
L328118	u1561	m104	FERRIE	The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
L328117	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
L328116	u1561	m104	FERRIE	It leads farther than that.
L328115	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
L328114	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You still questioning any Cubans?
L328113	u1574	m104	LOU	What did they...
L328112	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
L328111	u1574	m104	LOU	What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
L328110	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
L328109	u1574	m104	LOU	Calm down, Dave, what?
L328108	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
L328107	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
L328106	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
L328105	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave?
L328104	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You know damn well who it is.
L328170	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
L328169	u1568	m104	JIM	Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
L328168	u1561	m104	FERRIE	They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
L328167	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
L328166	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
L328165	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
L328164	u1568	m104	JIM	Then who killed the President?
L328161	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
L328160	u1568	m104	JIM	What about Ruby?
L328159	u1561	m104	FERRIE	"Shaw's an ""untouchable"", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency."
L328158	u1568	m104	JIM	And Shaw?
L328157	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
L328156	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
L328155	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
L328154	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
L328153	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
L328152	u1568	m104	JIM	Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
L328149	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
L328148	u1568	m104	JIM	Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
L328140	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
L328139	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
L328138	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
L328137	u1568	m104	JIM	Who was paying you, Dave?
L328136	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
L328135	u1568	m104	JIM	You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
L327922	u1568	m104	JIM	"Would you say this ""Leon"" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?"
L327921	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
L327607	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
L327606	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Why?  What's wrong?
L327605	u1568	m104	JIM	I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
L327604	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
L327603	u1568	m104	JIM	Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
L327602	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
L327601	u1568	m104	JIM	But the boys told us they didn't get any.
L327600	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I believe the boys got a couple.
L327599	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you bag any geese on this trip?
L327598	u1561	m104	FERRIE	In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
L327597	u1568	m104	JIM	And then Sunday?
L327596	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
L327595	u1568	m104	JIM	Why Galveston?
L327594	u1561	m104	FERRIE	We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
L327593	u1568	m104	JIM	I see.  And where did you drive?
L327592	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
L327591	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
L327590	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
L327589	u1568	m104	JIM	What was so appealing about Houston?
L327588	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
L327587	u1568	m104	JIM	Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
L327586	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No, I never saw him before in my life.
L327585	u1568	m104	JIM	I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
L327584	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
L327583	u1568	m104	JIM	But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
L327582	u1561	m104	FERRIE	That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
L327581	u1568	m104	JIM	How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
L327580	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
L327579	u1568	m104	JIM	How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
L327578	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
L327577	u1568	m104	JIM	Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
L328676	u1562	m104	FINCK	Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
L328675	u1568	m104	JIM	There were admirals.
L328674	u1562	m104	FINCK	No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
L328673	u1568	m104	JIM	But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
L328672	u1562	m104	FINCK	No.
L328671	u1568	m104	JIM	But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
L328670	u1562	m104	FINCK	I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
L328667	u1562	m104	FINCK	Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
L328666	u1568	m104	JIM	Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
L328665	u1562	m104	FINCK	I had the cause of death.
L328664	u1568	m104	JIM	As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
L328663	u1562	m104	FINCK	I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
L328662	u1568	m104	JIM	Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
L328631	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
L328630	u1564	m104	GARRISON	I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
L328629	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
L328628	u1564	m104	GARRISON	That's our case!
L328627	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
L328626	u1564	m104	GARRISON	Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
L328622	u1564	m104	GARRISON	What?
L328621	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
L328556	u1568	m104	JIM	There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
L328555	u1566	m104	JASPER	I'm scared.
L328551	u1568	m104	JIM	No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
L328550	u1566	m104	JASPER	Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
L328549	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
L328548	u1566	m104	JASPER	Are we going away, Daddy?
L328077	u1568	m104	JIM	Hi, Freckle Face.
L328076	u1566	m104	JASPER	Daddy!  Where have you been?
L327642	u1566	m104	JASPER	A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
L327641	u1568	m104	JIM	That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
L327640	u1566	m104	JASPER	Dad, look what I drew.
L327632	u1568	m104	JIM	Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
L327631	u1566	m104	JASPER	Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
L328398	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
L328397	u1571	m104	LAWYER	Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
L328396	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
L328395	u1571	m104	LAWYER	I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
L328394	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
L328393	u1571	m104	LAWYER	...you heard echoes.
L328392	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
L328391	u1571	m104	LAWYER	I want the truth.
L328390	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
L328389	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
L328388	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No, you don't!
L328387	u1571	m104	LAWYER	That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
L328386	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
L328385	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
L328384	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
L328383	u1576	m104	MAN	We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
L328382	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
L328381	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
L328380	u1576	m104	MAN	That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
L328379	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Four to six.
L328378	u1576	m104	MAN	How many shots you say you heard?
L328377	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
L328578	u1568	m104	JIM	I know.
L328577	u1586	m104	SUSIE	I'm sorry.
L328499	u1568	m104	JIM	No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
L328498	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Aren't you being a little hard?
L328449	u1586	m104	SUSIE	This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
L328448	u1568	m104	JIM	I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
L328238	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
L328237	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't believe it!
L327989	u1568	m104	JIM	"Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word ""microdots"" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for..."
L327988	u1586	m104	SUSIE	"...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name ""Oswald"" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name ""Oswald"" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity."
L327821	u1568	m104	JIM	"I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying ""We both know who's responsible.""  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?"
L327820	u1586	m104	SUSIE	All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
L327819	u1568	m104	JIM	Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
L327818	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
L327808	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
L327807	u1568	m104	JIM	Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
L327806	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
L327805	u1568	m104	JIM	Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
L327804	u1586	m104	SUSIE	None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
L327803	u1568	m104	JIM	And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
L327802	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
L327801	u1568	m104	JIM	But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
L327800	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
L327799	u1568	m104	JIM	This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
L327798	u1586	m104	SUSIE	None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
L327797	u1568	m104	JIM	Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
L327791	u1586	m104	SUSIE	But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
L327790	u1568	m104	JIM	Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
L327789	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
L327782	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
L327781	u1568	m104	JIM	If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
L328072	u1585	m104	SHAW	Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
L328071	u1568	m104	JIM	I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
L328070	u1585	m104	SHAW	May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
L328069	u1568	m104	JIM	No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
L328068	u1585	m104	SHAW	And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
L328067	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
L328066	u1585	m104	SHAW	Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
L328065	u1568	m104	JIM	...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
L328064	u1585	m104	SHAW	Nonsense.  What next?
L328063	u1568	m104	JIM	It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
L328062	u1585	m104	SHAW	I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
L328061	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
L328060	u1585	m104	SHAW	Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
L328059	u1568	m104	JIM	Please answer the question.
L328058	u1585	m104	SHAW	You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
L328057	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
L328056	u1585	m104	SHAW	Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
L328055	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
L328048	u1585	m104	SHAW	One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
L328047	u1568	m104	JIM	No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
L328046	u1585	m104	SHAW	Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
L328045	u1568	m104	JIM	Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
L328044	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
L328043	u1568	m104	JIM	Let me show you his picture. 
L328040	u1568	m104	JIM	...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
L328039	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
L328038	u1568	m104	JIM	David Ferrie.
L328037	u1585	m104	SHAW	Who?
L328036	u1568	m104	JIM	...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
L328035	u1585	m104	SHAW	Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
L328034	u1568	m104	JIM	After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
L328033	u1585	m104	SHAW	"It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering ""Frankie!"" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?"
L328032	u1568	m104	JIM	I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
L328031	u1585	m104	SHAW	Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
L328030	u1568	m104	JIM	Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
L328028	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
L328027	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
L328026	u1568	m104	JIM	A Willie O'Keefe?
L328025	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.
L328024	u1568	m104	JIM	A Perry Russo?
L328023	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  Never heard of him.
L328022	u1568	m104	JIM	We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
L328021	u1585	m104	SHAW	I wouldn't imagine where.
L328020	u1568	m104	JIM	Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
L328019	u1585	m104	SHAW	I'm not sure I understand.
L328346	u1578	m104	MERCER	I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
L328345	u1568	m104	JIM	Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
L328344	u1578	m104	MERCER	"This says ""Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck.""  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all..."
L328343	u1578	m104	MERCER	That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
L328342	u1568	m104	JIM	But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
L328341	u1578	m104	MERCER	"That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, ""that was the man I saw in the truck."""
L328340	u1568	m104	JIM	You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
L328332	u1578	m104	MERCER	Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
L328331	u1568	m104	JIM	In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
L328598	u1572	m104	LIZ	Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
L328597	u1568	m104	JIM	He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
L328596	u1572	m104	LIZ	Huh?
L328595	u1568	m104	JIM	They killed him, honey.
L328591	u1572	m104	LIZ	I don't think so, Jim...
L328590	u1568	m104	JIM	I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
L328589	u1572	m104	LIZ	And if you're wrong?
L328546	u1572	m104	LIZ	You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
L328545	u1568	m104	JIM	"Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and ""I'm jes fine honey.""  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not ""fine"" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away."
L328544	u1572	m104	LIZ	Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
L328543	u1568	m104	JIM	That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
L328542	u1572	m104	LIZ	"I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid ""trial""! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?"
L328541	u1568	m104	JIM	Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
L328540	u1572	m104	LIZ	I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
L328539	u1568	m104	JIM	Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
L328538	u1572	m104	LIZ	Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
L328537	u1568	m104	JIM	I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
L328536	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
L328535	u1568	m104	JIM	I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
L328534	u1572	m104	LIZ	You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
L328533	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
L328532	u1572	m104	LIZ	I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
L328531	u1568	m104	JIM	Get a hold of yourself.
L328530	u1572	m104	LIZ	How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
L328529	u1568	m104	JIM	Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
L328528	u1572	m104	LIZ	Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
L328527	u1568	m104	JIM	Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
L328526	u1572	m104	LIZ	Your daughter's life was just threatened!
L328525	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
L328524	u1572	m104	LIZ	A man just called.  He asked her everything!
L328523	u1568	m104	JIM	What?
L328522	u1572	m104	LIZ	Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
L328131	u1572	m104	LIZ	Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
L328130	u1568	m104	JIM	Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
L328127	u1568	m104	JIM	Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
L328126	u1572	m104	LIZ	It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
L328125	u1568	m104	JIM	Did they live?
L328087	u1568	m104	JIM	It's going to get worse, honey.
L328086	u1572	m104	LIZ	That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
L328085	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
L328084	u1572	m104	LIZ	"I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, ""Where's Daddy?""  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!"
L328083	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
L328082	u1572	m104	LIZ	We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
L328081	u1568	m104	JIM	Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
L328080	u1572	m104	LIZ	My sympathies.
L328079	u1568	m104	JIM	Tough day.
L328078	u1572	m104	LIZ	Hi.
L328016	u1568	m104	JIM	Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
L328015	u1572	m104	LIZ	You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
L328014	u1568	m104	JIM	I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
L328013	u1572	m104	LIZ	Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
L328012	u1568	m104	JIM	Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
L328011	u1572	m104	LIZ	But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
L328010	u1568	m104	JIM	No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
L328007	u1568	m104	JIM	You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
L328006	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
L328004	u1568	m104	JIM	It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
L328003	u1572	m104	LIZ	Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
L327674	u1568	m104	JIM	Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
L327673	u1572	m104	LIZ	Honey, go back to sleep, please!
L327672	u1568	m104	JIM	Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
L327671	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
L327670	u1568	m104	JIM	"And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  ""He only had two more Russian words right than wrong.""  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess."
L327669	u1572	m104	LIZ	These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
L327668	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
L327667	u1572	m104	LIZ	I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
L327666	u1568	m104	JIM	It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
L327665	u1572	m104	LIZ	Honey, you all right? 
L327647	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
L327646	u1572	m104	LIZ	One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
L327639	u1572	m104	LIZ	Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
L327638	u1568	m104	JIM	I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
L327630	u1572	m104	LIZ	Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
L327629	u1568	m104	JIM	Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
L327628	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
L327953	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
L327952	u1568	m104	JIM	No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
L327951	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
L327950	u1568	m104	JIM	You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
L327949	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
L327948	u1568	m104	JIM	Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
L327913	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
L327912	u1568	m104	JIM	Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
L327909	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Well... yeah.
L327908	u1568	m104	JIM	For sexual purposes?
L327905	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
L327904	u1568	m104	JIM	I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
L328497	u1574	m104	LOU	You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
L328496	u1568	m104	JIM	I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
L328495	u1574	m104	LOU	Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
L328494	u1568	m104	JIM	Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
L328493	u1574	m104	LOU	Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
L328492	u1568	m104	JIM	Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
L328491	u1574	m104	LOU	I just plain don't trust him anymore.
L328486	u1568	m104	JIM	We need him back.
L328485	u1574	m104	LOU	Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
L328431	u1574	m104	LOU	You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
L328430	u1568	m104	JIM	Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
L328429	u1574	m104	LOU	They're gonna love you, chief.
L328428	u1568	m104	JIM	Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
L328427	u1574	m104	LOU	Allen Dulles?
L328426	u1568	m104	JIM	His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
L328425	u1574	m104	LOU	The Warren Commission call him?
L328424	u1568	m104	JIM	"General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a ""traitor"".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw."
L328423	u1574	m104	LOU	Who?
L328422	u1568	m104	JIM	Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
L328421	u1574	m104	LOU	No.
L328420	u1568	m104	JIM	You know who the mayor was?
L328419	u1574	m104	LOU	"Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, ""and afterwards there's only the freeway,"" and went home."
L328418	u1568	m104	JIM	Who do you think changed the parade route?
L328415	u1574	m104	LOU	"One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... ""3-2-1...  green!""  Or else ""Abort!  Abort!"""
L328414	u1568	m104	JIM	How many men?
L328413	u1574	m104	LOU	When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
L328410	u1568	m104	JIM	Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
L328409	u1574	m104	LOU	That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
L328408	u1568	m104	JIM	The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
L328407	u1574	m104	LOU	It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
L328406	u1568	m104	JIM	Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
L328405	u1574	m104	LOU	The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
L328404	u1568	m104	JIM	Between six and seven seconds.
L328403	u1574	m104	LOU	Time?
L328252	u1574	m104	LOU	I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
L328251	u1568	m104	JIM	I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
L328231	u1574	m104	LOU	I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
L328230	u1568	m104	JIM	I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
L328229	u1574	m104	LOU	You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
L328090	u1574	m104	LOU	"And it ain't pretty  ...""the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966."
L328089	u1568	m104	JIM	Goddamn Sam!
L327992	u1568	m104	JIM	I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
L327991	u1574	m104	LOU	Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
L327835	u1568	m104	JIM	Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
L327834	u1574	m104	LOU	I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
L327779	u1574	m104	LOU	Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
L327778	u1568	m104	JIM	Can we find her?
L327777	u1574	m104	LOU	There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
L327776	u1568	m104	JIM	We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
L327775	u1574	m104	LOU	Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
L327773	u1574	m104	LOU	...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
L327772	u1568	m104	JIM	Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
L327771	u1574	m104	LOU	...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
L327770	u1574	m104	LOU	A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
L327769	u1568	m104	JIM	I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
L327768	u1574	m104	LOU	They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
L327708	u1568	m104	JIM	We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
L327707	u1574	m104	LOU	What are you driving at, boss?
L327706	u1568	m104	JIM	Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
L327704	u1574	m104	LOU	Once ONI, always ONI?
L327703	u1568	m104	JIM	Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
L327702	u1574	m104	LOU	Post Office.
L327701	u1568	m104	JIM	Take a look across the street.
L327700	u1574	m104	LOU	The Office of Naval Intelligence.
L327699	u1568	m104	JIM	Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
L327698	u1574	m104	LOU	I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
L327680	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
L327679	u1568	m104	JIM	Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
L327560	u1574	m104	LOU	He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
L327559	u1568	m104	JIM	I know David - a strange character.
L327521	u1568	m104	JIM	Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
L327520	u1574	m104	LOU	One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
L327494	u1574	m104	LOU	No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
L327493	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh no!... How bad?
L327492	u1574	m104	LOU	Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
L327491	u1568	m104	JIM	What's wrong, Lou?
L327627	u1573	m104	LONG	Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
L327626	u1568	m104	JIM	Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
L327625	u1573	m104	LONG	Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
L327624	u1568	m104	JIM	You think there were other men involved, Russell?
L327623	u1573	m104	LONG	"If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  ""I'm just a patsy.""  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me."
L327622	u1568	m104	JIM	You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
L327621	u1573	m104	LONG	"Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One ""pristine"" bullet?  That dog don't hunt."
L327620	u1568	m104	JIM	I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
L327618	u1573	m104	LONG	Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
L327617	u1568	m104	JIM	I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
L327616	u1573	m104	LONG	"Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? ""Love Child.""  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House."
L328572	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	No, it can't!
L328571	u1568	m104	JIM	Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
L328570	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Pictures like this don't show up on television!
L328568	u1568	m104	JIM	That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
L328567	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Are they?  Why would they?
L328566	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
L328565	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Some people would say you're paranoid.
L328564	u1568	m104	JIM	Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
L328563	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
L328560	u1568	m104	JIM	I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
L328559	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
L328786	u1588	m104	X	I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
L328785	u1568	m104	JIM	Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
L328784	u1588	m104	X	It never did. 
L328783	u1568	m104	JIM	...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
L328782	u1588	m104	X	"I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say ""protection"" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of ""okay"" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again."
L328781	u1588	m104	X	Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
L328780	u1568	m104	JIM	His name?
L328779	u1588	m104	X	You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
L328778	u1568	m104	JIM	Ever ask him?
L328777	u1588	m104	X	...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
L328776	u1568	m104	JIM	...and your General?
L328775	u1588	m104	X	...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
L328774	u1568	m104	JIM	Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
L328773	u1588	m104	X	He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
L328755	u1588	m104	X	I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
L328754	u1568	m104	JIM	Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
L328753	u1588	m104	X	You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
L328752	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, thanks for coming.
L328309	u1588	m104	X	But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
L328308	u1568	m104	JIM	I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
L328307	u1588	m104	X	No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
L328306	u1568	m104	JIM	The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
L328305	u1588	m104	X	Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
L328304	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
L328290	u1588	m104	X	I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
L328289	u1568	m104	JIM	I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
L328288	u1588	m104	X	I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
L328287	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
L328286	u1588	m104	X	I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
L328285	u1568	m104	JIM	Yes.
L328284	u1588	m104	X	Jim Garrison?
L327754	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You're so naive, mister.
L327753	u1568	m104	JIM	Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
L327752	u1577	m104	MARTIN	What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
L327751	u1568	m104	JIM	Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
L327750	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
L327749	u1568	m104	JIM	The assassination, Jack?
L327748	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
L327747	u1568	m104	JIM	Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
L327746	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
L327745	u1568	m104	JIM	Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
L327744	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
L327742	u1577	m104	MARTIN	There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
L327741	u1568	m104	JIM	Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
L327737	u1568	m104	JIM	Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
L327736	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
L327735	u1568	m104	JIM	And Oswald?
L327734	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
L327732	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
L327731	u1568	m104	JIM	Where is Banister in all this?
L327728	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
L327727	u1568	m104	JIM	Was he there often?
L327726	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
L327725	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
L327724	u1568	m104	JIM	Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
L327723	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
L327722	u1568	m104	JIM	You have other information?
L327721	u1577	m104	MARTIN	If you buy what you read in the paper.
L327720	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
L327719	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I don't know if I should talk about this.
L327718	u1568	m104	JIM	How much more?
L327716	u1568	m104	JIM	Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
L327715	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Never touched me.
L327714	u1568	m104	JIM	And he never hit you before?
L327713	u1577	m104	MARTIN	More than ten years.
L327712	u1568	m104	JIM	Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
L328588	u1568	m104	JIM	It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
L328587	u1581	m104	NUMA	Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
L328586	u1568	m104	JIM	"I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, ""The Old Man and the Sea""?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton."
L328584	u1568	m104	JIM	He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
L328583	u1581	m104	NUMA	Sure sounds like he's winning.
L328442	u1568	m104	JIM	I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
L328441	u1581	m104	NUMA	Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
L328440	u1568	m104	JIM	I just don't want to do it.  What else?
L328439	u1581	m104	NUMA	She's the best damn witness we have!
L328438	u1568	m104	JIM	No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
L328241	u1568	m104	JIM	Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
L328240	u1581	m104	NUMA	Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
L328233	u1568	m104	JIM	You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
L328232	u1581	m104	NUMA	HOLD IT, CHIEF...
L327994	u1568	m104	JIM	Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
L327993	u1581	m104	NUMA	Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
L327793	u1568	m104	JIM	It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
L327792	u1581	m104	NUMA	Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
L328218	u1568	m104	JIM	How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
L328217	u1579	m104	MILLER	Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
L328216	u1568	m104	JIM	And what would I have to do?
L328215	u1579	m104	MILLER	I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
L328214	u1579	m104	MILLER	Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
L328213	u1568	m104	JIM	The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
L328212	u1579	m104	MILLER	I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
L328209	u1568	m104	JIM	That's it.
L328208	u1579	m104	MILLER	That's all you've had all this time?
L328207	u1568	m104	JIM	Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
L328206	u1579	m104	MILLER	How many men are working with you on this?
L328205	u1568	m104	JIM	If you must know, virtually nothing.
L328204	u1579	m104	MILLER	I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
L328203	u1568	m104	JIM	I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
L328202	u1579	m104	MILLER	You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
L328201	u1568	m104	JIM	Germany.
L328200	u1579	m104	MILLER	Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
L328199	u1579	m104	MILLER	Splendid, love to see them.
L328198	u1568	m104	JIM	They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
L328197	u1568	m104	JIM	We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
L328196	u1579	m104	MILLER	I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
L328195	u1568	m104	JIM	Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
L328194	u1579	m104	MILLER	I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
L328193	u1579	m104	MILLER	Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
L328192	u1568	m104	JIM	Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
L328515	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Uh huh.
L328514	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Do you walk home?
L328513	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Yes.
L328512	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	And you get of from school at 3 every day?
L328510	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	And how tall are you?
L328509	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Six.
L328508	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
L328507	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	That sounds fun.
L328506	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
L328505	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Virginia.
L328504	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Virginia or Elizabeth?
L328503	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Yes?
L328502	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
L327860	u1584	m104	RUBY	Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
L327859	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
L327858	u1584	m104	RUBY	But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
L327857	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
L327856	u1584	m104	RUBY	What are they?
L327855	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
L327854	u1584	m104	RUBY	Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
L327853	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
L327852	u1584	m104	RUBY	When are you going back to Washington, sir?
L327851	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
L327850	u1584	m104	RUBY	Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
L364677	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
L364676	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Yeah.
L364675	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
L364674	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
L364673	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
L364672	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
L364671	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
L364670	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
L364669	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
L364668	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	That really you, Red?
L364667	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Take it easy, baby.
L364333	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Now.
L364332	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let Billie finish.
L364331	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	That's what it is. Walk on out.
L364330	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
L364329	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	There's two guns on you.
L364328	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm wearing, Archie.
L364327	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I don't want your money.
L364326	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'll give you back the 600.
L364325	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You know it.
L364324	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
L364323	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
L364322	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You're a damn liar.
L364315	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.

L364306	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You owe me six big ones.

L364277	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
L364272	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Bet you are.
L364271	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.

L364268	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	It hit?
L364265	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
L364264	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm working on it.
L364263	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I told you less paper, less trouble.
L364258	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let 'em come. I'm ready.
L364257	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
L364256	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Solid, daddy.
L364255	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	How's it feel?
L364251	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
L364250	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What?
L364249	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
L364246	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Just now.
L364245	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	When?
L364244	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I done told the man what he could do with his train.
L364243	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
L364240	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
L364239	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Why?
L364238	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yes, sir.
L364237	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Did you just now con me?
L364235	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yes, sir.
L364234	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
L364233	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Lemme write it down for you.
L364232	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
L364231	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Where can I get a hold of you?
L364226	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I like you, country.
L364225	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
L364224	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Is your papa West Indian?
L364223	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
L364222	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
L364221	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	How 'bout that?
L364220	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man's rep travels.
L364219	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
L364218	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Where I come from. Boston.
L364217	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Heard where?
L364216	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
L364215	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
L364214	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Keeps me out of the army.
L364213	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Bet you like that shit.
L364212	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm working trains. Selling.
L364209	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
L364208	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Red, and I ain't no punk.
L364207	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	What they call you?
L364206	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	He had it coming.
L364205	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
L364339	u1977	m128	SAMMY	He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
L364338	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	What you say?
L364337	u1977	m128	SAMMY	Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
L364336	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	The dirty yellow rat bastard.
L364230	u1977	m128	SAMMY	You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
L364229	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Yeah, got to do something about you.
L364211	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	That's a fact. What you do, boy?
L364210	u1977	m128	SAMMY	Man live by his rep.
L364946	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
L364945	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle.
L364944	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
L364685	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
L364684	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
L364590	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to. God knows I want to.
L364589	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
L364588	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't know how.
L364587	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Tell Him that.
L364586	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
L364585	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
L364584	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't know what to say to Allah.
L364583	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	-- the hardest and the greatest.
L364582	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
L364581	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
L364580	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I can't.
L364579	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	-- the hardest and the greatest.
L364578	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
L364577	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
L364576	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I can't.
L364575	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
L364574	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I will do it.
L364573	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
L364572	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
L364571	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	The body is a holy repository.
L364569	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	"No. Elijah Muhammad does not say ""that white man is a devil."" He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men."
L364568	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I sure met some.
L364567	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
L364566	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Then the devil is white.
L364565	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
L364563	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Who are you?
L364562	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
L364561	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
L364560	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Little.
L364557	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
L364556	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	A black man playing big league ball is something.
L364555	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
L364547	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
L364546	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
L364545	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
L364544	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
L364535	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Read it and keep on reading.
L364534	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
L364533	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
L364532	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Where am I gonna start?
L364531	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
L364530	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
L364528	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
L364527	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
L364526	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Then what you telling me to study in them for?
L364525	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
L364524	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
L364518	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
L364517	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I can't make out that shit.
L364513	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Okay, okay. Show me, man.
L364512	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
L364511	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What the hell for, man?
L364510	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
L364509	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What for?
L364508	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
L364507	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What? Everybody knows God is White.
L364506	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
L364505	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
L364504	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
L364503	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's what Mama used to say.
L364502	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
L364501	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you do with your time?
L364500	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Don't con me.
L364499	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Okay, okay.
L364498	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Don't con me. Don't try...
L364497	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
L364496	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
L364495	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"You the only cat don't come on with that ""Whatcha know, daddy"" jive; and you don't cuss none."
L364494	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
L364493	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
L364492	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
L364488	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
L364487	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Elijah who?
L364486	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
L364484	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
L364483	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, I don't want to hear all that.
L364482	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
L364480	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
L364479	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Leggo. I got to wash it out.
L364478	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I ain't said I'm ashamed.
L364477	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
L364476	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
L364475	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Why? Why does everybody conk?
L364474	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
L364473	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Putting all that poison in your hair.
L364472	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
L364471	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You ain't lying.
L364467	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
L364466	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What did you give it to me for then?
L364465	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
L364464	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
L364463	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
L364462	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
L364460	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
L364459	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
L364458	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, what do you want?
L364457	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
L364456	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Who the hell are you?
L364867	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
L364866	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	I'll have it tomorrow.
L364797	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
L364796	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
L364795	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
L364794	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
L364793	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Do you?
L364791	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
L364790	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What can I do for you?
L365084	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
L365083	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Make it plain.
L365066	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
L365065	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	Next week, Brother Minister.
L365064	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
L365062	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
L365061	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	No, Brother Minister.
L365060	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is the program ready?
L364875	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Come, sit with us.
L364874	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
L364873	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You are now Benjamin 2X.
L365047	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't think that's such a good idea.
L365046	u1961	m128	BETTY	I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
L365045	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
L365044	u1961	m128	BETTY	Dear heart, where are you?
L365043	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
L365042	u1961	m128	BETTY	Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
L365041	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Betty it's me. It's me.
L365040	u1961	m128	BETTY	Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
L365011	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
L365010	u1961	m128	BETTY	Dear heart, I love you.
L365009	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
L365008	u1961	m128	BETTY	Shhh!
L365007	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
L365006	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You have to sleep for three.
L365005	u1961	m128	BETTY	Get some sleep.
L364933	u1961	m128	BETTY	Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
L364932	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you want me to do?
L364931	u1961	m128	BETTY	We need you too!
L364930	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
L364929	u1961	m128	BETTY	Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
L364928	u1961	m128	BETTY	Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
L364927	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
L364926	u1961	m128	BETTY	What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
L364925	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
L364924	u1961	m128	BETTY	A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
L364923	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
L364922	u1961	m128	BETTY	Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
L364921	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
L364920	u1961	m128	BETTY	"No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in ""Muhammad Speaks"" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own."
L364919	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
L364918	u1961	m128	BETTY	To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
L364917	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
L364916	u1961	m128	BETTY	Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957...
L364915	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
L364914	u1961	m128	BETTY	Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children...
L364913	u1961	m128	BETTY	We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
L364912	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
L364911	u1961	m128	BETTY	The talk is everywhere!
L364910	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Talk about what?
L364909	u1961	m128	BETTY	We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
L364908	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I just want to sit here and be still.
L364907	u1961	m128	BETTY	I'm not made of glass.
L364906	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
L364904	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How do you know?
L364903	u1961	m128	BETTY	Because you're in trouble.
L364902	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Why are you looking at me like that?
L364828	u1961	m128	BETTY	The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
L364827	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you think?
L364826	u1961	m128	BETTY	I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
L364825	u1961	m128	BETTY	You're with me even when you're away.
L364824	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'll be away a lot.
L364823	u1961	m128	BETTY	Hush your mouth.
L364822	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It will be rough.
L364821	u1961	m128	BETTY	Just hold me.
L364820	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It won't be easy.
L364819	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I love you.
L364818	u1961	m128	BETTY	Yes. Did you eat?
L364817	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I think so. Can you catch a plane?
L364816	u1961	m128	BETTY	Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
L364815	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Did you hear what I said?
L364814	u1961	m128	BETTY	Yes.
L364813	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
L364812	u1961	m128	BETTY	I know.
L364811	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm in Detroit.
L364738	u1961	m128	BETTY	Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
L364737	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What have you set your mind to?
L364736	u1961	m128	BETTY	And dogged when I set my mind to something.
L364735	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Are you?
L364734	u1961	m128	BETTY	There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
L364733	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How old are you, Betty?
L364732	u1961	m128	BETTY	But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
L364731	u1961	m128	BETTY	If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
L364730	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Just an idle question.
L364729	u1961	m128	BETTY	Why do you ask?
L364728	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
L364727	u1961	m128	BETTY	You have enough worries of your own.
L364726	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
L364725	u1961	m128	BETTY	I can handle it.
L364724	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
L364723	u1961	m128	BETTY	Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
L364722	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
L364721	u1961	m128	BETTY	There's nothing to talk about.
L364720	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let's talk about you for a change.
L364719	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Delicious.
L364718	u1961	m128	BETTY	How do you like it?
L364717	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
L364716	u1961	m128	BETTY	What?
L364715	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
L364713	u1961	m128	BETTY	You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
L364712	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
L364711	u1961	m128	BETTY	Could we sit down someplace?
L364710	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
L364709	u1961	m128	BETTY	I see your point.
L364705	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
L364704	u1961	m128	BETTY	Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
L364701	u1961	m128	BETTY	That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
L364700	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What points?
L364697	u1961	m128	BETTY	Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
L364696	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
L364693	u1961	m128	BETTY	If you want to tell me.
L364692	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
L364690	u1961	m128	BETTY	She ate.
L364689	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What?
L365079	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Down front as always.
L365078	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is my family here yet?
L365077	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Let's cancel.
L365076	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
L365075	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Brother Minister, what is wrong?
L365072	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What did I tell you about assuming?
L365071	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I assumed...
L365070	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
L365069	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
L365068	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
L365067	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
L365038	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
L365037	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
L365036	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
L365035	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Let some of us come down there.
L365034	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
L365033	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
L365032	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brother Earl.
L365025	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Let's get out of this cold.
L365024	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
L364787	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's enough, Brother Earl.
L364786	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I'm tired of praying.
L364785	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
L364628	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
L364627	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Just what are you saying?
L364626	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
L364625	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Now just a moment, just a moment --
L364624	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Then we don't know that God was white.
L364623	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	I told you we don't know for certain.
L364622	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What color were the original Hebrews?
L364621	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Just what is your question?
L364620	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
L364619	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	That's right.
L364618	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	They were Hebrew, weren't they?
L364617	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	I don't think we know for certain.
L364616	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
L364615	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Why don't you just ask your question?
L364450	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
L364449	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
L364858	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, ""Let's go, let's separate"", he'd yell, ""Yeah, man, any place is better than this."" You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one."
L364857	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Let him finish.
L364852	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
L364851	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Entirely.
L364850	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: ""Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture."" Would you agree?"
L364849	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	You put it very well.
L364848	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"Stop me if I'm wrong. I ""polarize the community."" I ""erroneously appraise the racial picture."""
L364845	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, ""Do you hate me!"" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate."
L364844	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
L364843	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Please, go ahead.
L364842	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
L364957	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
L364956	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yes, sir, I did.
L364955	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	Did you see the papers today?
L364802	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Allah Akbar.
L364801	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
L364800	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let me do it then.
L364799	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
L364695	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
L364694	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	If you want to tell me.
L364899	u1966	m128	GREGORY	If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
L364898	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Say what you're saying.
L364897	u1966	m128	GREGORY	His greatest greatness.
L364896	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What?
L364895	u1966	m128	GREGORY	Are you Elijah's pimp?
L364894	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sure, man.
L364893	u1966	m128	GREGORY	Can I ask you something?
L364298	u1967	m128	HONEY	Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
L364297	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is she hooking?
L364296	u1967	m128	HONEY	If she got eyes, she do.
L364295	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	She know?
L364294	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	With him?
L364293	u1967	m128	HONEY	'Bout every other night, Red.
L364292	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
L364291	u1967	m128	HONEY	You know that gal?
L364286	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
L364285	u1967	m128	HONEY	And like a fool I believe it.
L364284	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I say a lot of things.
L364283	u1967	m128	HONEY	I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
L364419	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
L364418	u1968	m128	JUDGE	The sentences to run concurrently.
L364417	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
L364416	u1968	m128	JUDGE	Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
L364415	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
L364414	u1968	m128	JUDGE	Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
L364413	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
L364134	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
L364133	u1969	m128	LAURA	Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
L364132	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let's go.
L364130	u1969	m128	LAURA	I do know I love you.
L364129	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
L364128	u1969	m128	LAURA	Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
L364082	u1969	m128	LAURA	What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
L364081	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
L364080	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
L364079	u1969	m128	LAURA	I know where you're going.
L364078	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I mean it's late, baby.
L364077	u1969	m128	LAURA	I ain't stupid.
L364076	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I better not come in.
L364069	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Now you come back.
L364068	u1969	m128	LAURA	'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
L364152	u1970	m128	LOUISE	If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
L364151	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
L364150	u1970	m128	LOUISE	Did you hear me?!
L364149	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	Your control over your children, therefore --
L364148	u1970	m128	LOUISE	Get out.
L364147	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
L364146	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
L364145	u1970	m128	LOUISE	These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
L364144	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	-- there is a serious question as to whether --
L364143	u1970	m128	LOUISE	Murder.
L364142	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
L364972	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	And don't come back.
L364971	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	You're my father.
L364970	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
L364969	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Let me die then.
L364968	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	No. You'll be marked for death.
L364967	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	I'm with you, Brother Minister.
L364966	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What does Sidney say?
L364965	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
L364964	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What mission?
L364963	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
L364962	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How long has this been going on?
L364961	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Another one?
L364892	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Please make way, please --
L364891	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
L364634	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
L364633	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
L364632	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	500.
L364631	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How many you turning out?
L364335	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
L364334	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You had the number.
L364276	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Well, bitch you move too slow.
L364275	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
L364126	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
L364125	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You will, baby -- if the time come.
L364124	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Me?
L364123	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler ""rape,"" sister?"
L364118	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What's your story, baby?
L364117	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You evil this morning.
L364115	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You better believe it.
L364114	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You the man.
L364113	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You hear me, girl?
L364112	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Sweetie, they're almost ready.
L364111	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	C'mere.
L364110	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
L364092	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
L364091	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
L364090	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	...That isn't a whore?
L364089	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
L364659	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
L364658	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
L364657	u1978	m128	SHORTY	You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
L364656	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
L364655	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
L364654	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
L364653	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
L364652	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
L364651	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
L364405	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
L364404	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
L364403	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yeah.
L364402	u1978	m128	SHORTY	What did you do, Homey, palm it?
L364400	u1978	m128	SHORTY	You the man!
L364399	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
L364379	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Tell him about Baldy.
L364378	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That ain't bad.
L364367	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
L364366	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
L364365	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
L364364	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I ain't doing bad.
L364363	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
L364102	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I'm not too short to be Cagney.
L364101	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You're too small to be Bogart.
L364100	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
L364099	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The hell you are.
L364098	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
L364097	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
L364096	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Bang, bang. You're dead.
L364095	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Eat lead, coppers.
L364094	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
L364073	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
L364072	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
L364071	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Fine as May wine.
L364070	u1978	m128	SHORTY	That's a fine chick.
L364067	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Shorty, this is Laura.
L364066	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Hey, man, gimme some skin.
L364049	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Well, all reet, then.
L364048	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Well, all right, then.
L364398	u1976	m128	RUDY	Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
L364397	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
L364390	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
L364389	u1976	m128	RUDY	I'm the man.
L364388	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Head nigger in charge?
L364387	u1976	m128	RUDY	That's right.
L364386	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You want to be the head man?
L364385	u1976	m128	RUDY	Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
L364384	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Might be all right.
L364383	u1976	m128	RUDY	So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
L364382	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	So what about him?
L364381	u1976	m128	RUDY	Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
L364375	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What can you do?
L364374	u1976	m128	RUDY	I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
L364768	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
L364767	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	Watch your tongue, boy.
L364766	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Only a pig could do a thing like that.
L364761	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	Eddie, let's see that blotter.
L364760	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brothers of Brother Johnson.
L364759	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	Who the hell are they?
L364757	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
L364756	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
L364942	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Allah will provide.
L364941	u1980	m128	SISTER LUCILLE	Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
L364940	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Are you sure?
L364939	u1980	m128	SISTER LUCILLE	Yes sir.
L364938	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	He told you that?
L364937	u1980	m128	SISTER LUCILLE	Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
L364161	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
L364160	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
L364159	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	They talked about me like
L364158	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	He's bright.
L364157	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
L364156	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
L364155	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
L364154	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
L364153	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
L421469	u2322	m150	BUZHARDT	But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
L421468	u2340	m150	NIXON	For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
L421459	u2340	m150	NIXON	You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
L421458	u2322	m150	BUZHARDT	We could check the tape again, sir.
L421457	u2340	m150	NIXON	Never.  I never said that about Jews!
L421456	u2322	m150	BUZHARDT	You did say it, sir.
L421455	u2340	m150	NIXON	You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
L421421	u2340	m150	NIXON	Then tell Richardson to fire him.
L421420	u2322	m150	BUZHARDT	Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
L421395	u2340	m150	NIXON	They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
L421394	u2322	m150	BUZHARDT	Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
L420892	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
L420891	u2323	m150	CUSHMAN	"That's Helms.  He's ""sang froid,"" a world-class poker player."
L420890	u2340	m150	NIXON	Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
L420889	u2323	m150	CUSHMAN	He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
L420888	u2340	m150	NIXON	We'll see about that ...
L420887	u2323	m150	CUSHMAN	Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
L420886	u2340	m150	NIXON	How's the job coming, Bob?
L420885	u2323	m150	CUSHMAN	Then his office will be fine.
L420884	u2340	m150	NIXON	No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
L420883	u2323	m150	CUSHMAN	He told me to take you to his conference room.
L420882	u2340	m150	NIXON	So ... let's go ...
L420881	u2323	m150	CUSHMAN	Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
L420880	u2340	m150	NIXON	Where the hell is he?
L420879	u2323	m150	CUSHMAN	Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
L421320	u2340	m150	NIXON	Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
L421319	u2324	m150	DEAN	I understand that, sir.
L421318	u2340	m150	NIXON	"John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, ""On the road of the informer, it's always night.""  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency."
L421317	u2324	m150	DEAN	I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
L421316	u2340	m150	NIXON	Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
L421315	u2324	m150	DEAN	You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
L421312	u2340	m150	NIXON	We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
L421311	u2324	m150	DEAN	No, we have nothing to hide.
L421310	u2340	m150	NIXON	He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
L421307	u2340	m150	NIXON	"I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: ""Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that."" ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility."
L421306	u2324	m150	DEAN	I agree it's ridiculous but --
L421305	u2340	m150	NIXON	Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
L421304	u2324	m150	DEAN	Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
L421303	u2340	m150	NIXON	You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
L421302	u2324	m150	DEAN	I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
L421301	u2340	m150	NIXON	We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
L421300	u2324	m150	DEAN	Uh huh ...
L421299	u2340	m150	NIXON	We could get that.
L421298	u2324	m150	DEAN	Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
L421297	u2340	m150	NIXON	How much do you need?
L421256	u2324	m150	DEAN	Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
L421255	u2340	m150	NIXON	Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
L421244	u2340	m150	NIXON	I like that.  That's a solution.
L421243	u2324	m150	DEAN	Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
L421242	u2340	m150	NIXON	What?
L421241	u2324	m150	DEAN	Executive clemency ...
L421221	u2340	m150	NIXON	Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
L421220	u2324	m150	DEAN	He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
L421219	u2340	m150	NIXON	Son of a bitch.
L421218	u2324	m150	DEAN	Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
L421180	u2340	m150	NIXON	Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
L421179	u2324	m150	DEAN	Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
L421178	u2340	m150	NIXON	So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
L420174	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Ex-CIA?  There's no such thing as ""ex-CIA,"" John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?"
L420173	u2324	m150	DEAN	The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
L421293	u2332	m150	HUNT	John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
L421292	u2324	m150	DEAN	Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
L421291	u2332	m150	HUNT	I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
L421290	u2324	m150	DEAN	To protect his people.
L421289	u2332	m150	HUNT	That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
L421288	u2324	m150	DEAN	How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
L421286	u2332	m150	HUNT	In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
L421285	u2324	m150	DEAN	Is it?
L421284	u2332	m150	HUNT	I'll bet he would.
L421283	u2324	m150	DEAN	The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
L421282	u2332	m150	HUNT	Yes ... I got the money.
L421281	u2324	m150	DEAN	I was sorry to hear about your wife.
L421278	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	So you tell Mitchell ...
L421277	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	"Dick Nixon saying ""I'm sorry""? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off."
L421276	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	"Eight words back in '72 -- ""I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry"" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him."
L421275	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
L421274	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	"They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the ""P"" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits."
L421273	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Yeah?
L421272	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
L421271	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	I figured that out.
L421270	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	It's a code or something.
L421267	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	You think this is just about politics?
L421266	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	"The ""Old Man"" plays politics harder than anybody else."
L421265	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
L421264	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	How so?
L421263	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
L421262	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
L421261	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Why me?
L421260	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	You do it.
L421259	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
L421169	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
L421168	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
L420869	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
L420868	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
L420169	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
L420168	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
L421253	u2340	m150	NIXON	We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
L421252	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
L421251	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
L421250	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
L421249	u2340	m150	NIXON	I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
L421246	u2340	m150	NIXON	And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
L421245	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
L421238	u2340	m150	NIXON	Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
L421237	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	What about England?
L421196	u2340	m150	NIXON	My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
L421195	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
L421194	u2340	m150	NIXON	I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
L421176	u2340	m150	NIXON	"No, no.  He's our only ""star"" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to."
L421175	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
L421171	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	"Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... ""unstable.""  Claims he has to handle you ""with kid gloves"" ..."
L421170	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, you didn't, Bob.
L421114	u2340	m150	NIXON	"The hard-core four million ""Nixon nuts"" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists."
L421113	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	The country's loving it.
L420878	u2340	m150	NIXON	Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
L420877	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
L420875	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
L420874	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
L420843	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
L420842	u2340	m150	NIXON	The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
L420839	u2340	m150	NIXON	-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.
L420838	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	I thought the gloves were off.
L420837	u2340	m150	NIXON	We can't touch Hoover --
L420822	u2340	m150	NIXON	No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
L420821	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
L420809	u2340	m150	NIXON	I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
L420808	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
L420807	u2340	m150	NIXON	Why not?
L420806	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
L420805	u2340	m150	NIXON	Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
L420275	u2340	m150	NIXON	We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
L420274	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	No, sir.
L420273	u2340	m150	NIXON	This is not a joke, John!
L420272	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
L420271	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
L420260	u2340	m150	NIXON	What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
L420259	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
L420258	u2340	m150	NIXON	Pay him.
L420257	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	He wants money.
L420256	u2340	m150	NIXON	And?
L420255	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
L420254	u2340	m150	NIXON	Where's Hunt now?
L420233	u2340	m150	NIXON	Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
L420232	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
L420231	u2340	m150	NIXON	I like it.  I like the idea.
L420208	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
L420207	u2340	m150	NIXON	Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
L420189	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
L420188	u2340	m150	NIXON	Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
L420186	u2340	m150	NIXON	Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
L420185	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
L420184	u2340	m150	NIXON	I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
L420176	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Find out what the hell he was doing at ""CREEP.""  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up."
L420175	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	McCord? ...
L420172	u2340	m150	NIXON	No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
L420171	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Mitchell?
L420170	u2340	m150	NIXON	Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
L420167	u2340	m150	NIXON	Jesus!  Through a window?
L420166	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
L420165	u2340	m150	NIXON	Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
L420164	u2325	m150	EHRLICHMAN	Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
L421530	u2340	m150	NIXON	That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
L421529	u2326	m150	HAIG	Sir?
L421528	u2340	m150	NIXON	It came over from Vietnam, you know.
L421527	u2326	m150	HAIG	I know it well, sir.
L421526	u2340	m150	NIXON	... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
L421505	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
L421504	u2326	m150	HAIG	"... you mentioned the ""Bay of Pigs"" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ..."
L421503	u2340	m150	NIXON	I don't know anything about that.
L421502	u2326	m150	HAIG	Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
L421501	u2340	m150	NIXON	That's right ...
L421500	u2326	m150	HAIG	"Sir, you talked about opening up the whole ""Bay of Pigs"" thing again."
L421499	u2340	m150	NIXON	There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
L421498	u2326	m150	HAIG	We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
L421497	u2326	m150	HAIG	How do you see this?
L421496	u2340	m150	NIXON	That was civil war.
L421495	u2326	m150	HAIG	Lincoln used it.
L421494	u2340	m150	NIXON	The army?
L421492	u2340	m150	NIXON	And if I stay?
L421491	u2326	m150	HAIG	If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
L421490	u2326	m150	HAIG	It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
L421489	u2340	m150	NIXON	Can we get around this, Al?
L421488	u2326	m150	HAIG	Sir, the deadline is today.
L421487	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
L421486	u2326	m150	HAIG	"Your lawyers feel it's the ... ""smoking gun."""
L421485	u2340	m150	NIXON	So?
L421484	u2326	m150	HAIG	June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
L421483	u2326	m150	HAIG	I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
L421482	u2340	m150	NIXON	Victory at Sea, Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
L421474	u2340	m150	NIXON	I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first.  And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
L421473	u2326	m150	HAIG	He's completely lost touch with reality.
L421472	u2340	m150	NIXON	... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
L421423	u2340	m150	NIXON	The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
L421422	u2326	m150	HAIG	Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
L421419	u2326	m150	HAIG	But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
L421418	u2340	m150	NIXON	Cox!  Fire him.
L421417	u2326	m150	HAIG	Who?
L421402	u2340	m150	NIXON	A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
L421401	u2326	m150	HAIG	About a dozen.
L421393	u2340	m150	NIXON	For what?!
L421392	u2326	m150	HAIG	Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
L421391	u2340	m150	NIXON	Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
L421390	u2326	m150	HAIG	Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
L421389	u2340	m150	NIXON	Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
L421388	u2326	m150	HAIG	This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
L421387	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
L420785	u2340	m150	NIXON	"These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- ""T.R."" -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice."
L420784	u2326	m150	HAIG	That's what they're doing.
L420783	u2340	m150	NIXON	Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
L420155	u2340	m150	NIXON	'Night, Al.
L420154	u2326	m150	HAIG	I don't have a pistol.
L420153	u2340	m150	NIXON	You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
L420152	u2326	m150	HAIG	You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
L420151	u2340	m150	NIXON	Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
L420150	u2326	m150	HAIG	No, sir, you did not.
L420148	u2326	m150	HAIG	You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
L420147	u2340	m150	NIXON	There's no secrets here, Al.
L420146	u2326	m150	HAIG	May I say something, Mr. President?
L420145	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: ""Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!"" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon."
L420144	u2326	m150	HAIG	At least Mitchell stood up to it.
L420143	u2340	m150	NIXON	I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
L420142	u2326	m150	HAIG	Mr. Hoover was a realist.
L420141	u2340	m150	NIXON	... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
L420140	u2340	m150	NIXON	... go on.
L420139	u2326	m150	HAIG	Sorry ...
L420134	u2326	m150	HAIG	It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
L420133	u2340	m150	NIXON	This is June twentieth?
L421326	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Sir ... six bodies.
L421325	u2340	m150	NIXON	... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
L421324	u2340	m150	NIXON	No ...
L421323	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	More light, chief?
L421240	u2340	m150	NIXON	For God's sake, when does this end?!
L421239	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
L421236	u2340	m150	NIXON	Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
L421235	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
L421234	u2340	m150	NIXON	I promised Iran to Townsend.
L421233	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
L421232	u2340	m150	NIXON	What about the documents he promised?
L421231	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
L421226	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	When I met with him, he said ...
L421225	u2340	m150	NIXON	How?
L421224	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	We could leverage Helms.
L421223	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's Helms -- it's got to be.
L421222	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
L421217	u2340	m150	NIXON	He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
L421216	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
L421202	u2340	m150	NIXON	"... worrying whether someone said something ""nice"" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ..."
L421201	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
L421200	u2340	m150	NIXON	You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
L421199	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
L421198	u2340	m150	NIXON	Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
L421197	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Because they're not Americans.
L421174	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
L421173	u2340	m150	NIXON	My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
L421172	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
L421166	u2340	m150	NIXON	This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
L421165	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
L421163	u2340	m150	NIXON	The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
L421162	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Sir?
L421161	u2340	m150	NIXON	... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
L421160	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	I believe you're right, boss.
L421159	u2340	m150	NIXON	You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
L421149	u2340	m150	NIXON	Let him finish, Bob.
L421148	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
L421120	u2340	m150	NIXON	Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
L421119	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	"The blacks are lost, the ""schwartzes"" are gone ..."
L421118	u2340	m150	NIXON	You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
L421117	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
L421112	u2340	m150	NIXON	Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
L421111	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
L421031	u2340	m150	NIXON	"... ""The Beast.""  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of ""the Beast.""  She called it a wild animal."
L421030	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Sir?
L421029	u2340	m150	NIXON	She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
L421028	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	What?
L421027	u2340	m150	NIXON	She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
L421026	u2340	m150	NIXON	Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
L421025	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	We really must go, Mr. President.
L421013	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
L421012	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Mr. President!
L420873	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
L420872	u2340	m150	NIXON	But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
L420867	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's the parents' fault really.
L420866	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
L420865	u2340	m150	NIXON	There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
L420864	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
L420863	u2340	m150	NIXON	Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
L420862	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Run 'em over.
L420861	u2340	m150	NIXON	No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
L420860	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
L420845	u2340	m150	NIXON	I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
L420844	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	... never complain, never explain, John ...
L420831	u2340	m150	NIXON	These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
L420830	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Sir?
L420829	u2340	m150	NIXON	Money.  Follow the money.
L420828	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
L420745	u2340	m150	NIXON	They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
L420744	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
L420742	u2340	m150	NIXON	I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
L420741	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	You never told him?
L420740	u2340	m150	NIXON	... he'd just found out about Track 2.
L420739	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of ""beast"" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ..."
L420738	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
L420737	u2340	m150	NIXON	Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
L420736	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
L420735	u2340	m150	NIXON	And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
L420734	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Jesus!
L420733	u2340	m150	NIXON	He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
L420732	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
L420731	u2340	m150	NIXON	The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
L420730	u2340	m150	NIXON	Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
L420729	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
L420728	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
L420727	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
L420726	u2340	m150	NIXON	He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
L420644	u2340	m150	NIXON	I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
L420643	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
L420440	u2340	m150	NIXON	No!
L420439	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
L420438	u2340	m150	NIXON	Where are they?
L420343	u2340	m150	NIXON	The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
L420342	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
L420330	u2340	m150	NIXON	... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
L420329	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
L420328	u2340	m150	NIXON	I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
L420314	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
L420313	u2340	m150	NIXON	... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
L420301	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
L420300	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
L420299	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
L420298	u2340	m150	NIXON	"This isn't a ""moral"" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary."
L420297	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Sir?
L420296	u2340	m150	NIXON	I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
L420295	u2340	m150	NIXON	Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
L420294	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	How is this national security?
L420293	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
L420292	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
L420291	u2340	m150	NIXON	Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
L420290	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
L420289	u2340	m150	NIXON	Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
L420288	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
L420287	u2340	m150	NIXON	Just do what I say, Bob.
L420286	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
L420285	u2340	m150	NIXON	Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
L420284	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	All right.
L420283	u2340	m150	NIXON	We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
L420282	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
L420281	u2340	m150	NIXON	Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
L420280	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
L420279	u2340	m150	NIXON	Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
L420277	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
L420276	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
L420270	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
L420269	u2340	m150	NIXON	National security priority restricted and controlled secret.
L420266	u2340	m150	NIXON	National Priority.
L420265	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
L420264	u2340	m150	NIXON	Security is not strong enough.
L420263	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	"But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's ""national security."""
L420262	u2340	m150	NIXON	Silence!
L420261	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	But what are we paying him for?
L420253	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	What do you mean, sir?
L420252	u2340	m150	NIXON	Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
L420229	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
L420228	u2340	m150	NIXON	Well, why not?
L420201	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	We were working on China.
L420200	u2340	m150	NIXON	Fucking hell.
L420199	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
L420198	u2340	m150	NIXON	I did?
L420197	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Yes, you approved it, sir.
L420196	u2340	m150	NIXON	I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
L420195	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
L420194	u2340	m150	NIXON	On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
L420191	u2340	m150	NIXON	Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
L420190	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
L420181	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
L420180	u2340	m150	NIXON	What's Liddy got?
L420179	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	"Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the ""Plumbers"" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation."
L420178	u2340	m150	NIXON	That fruitcake!  What about him?
L420177	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
L420163	u2340	m150	NIXON	Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
L420162	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
L420161	u2340	m150	NIXON	Their fourth!
L420160	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
L420159	u2340	m150	NIXON	But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
L420158	u2327	m150	HALDEMAN	Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
L420157	u2340	m150	NIXON	They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
L420767	u2328	m150	HANNAH	Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
L420766	u2342	m150	RICHARD	What about happiness, Mother?
L420765	u2328	m150	HANNAH	It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
L420764	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Did he have to die for me to get it?!
L420763	u2328	m150	HANNAH	It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
L420762	u2328	m150	HANNAH	Thou must.
L420761	u2342	m150	RICHARD	I can't ...
L420390	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Is it my turn?
L420389	u2328	m150	HANNAH	We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
L420386	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
L420385	u2328	m150	HANNAH	Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
L420384	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
L420383	u2328	m150	HANNAH	I expect more from thee, Richard.
L420382	u2342	m150	RICHARD	No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
L420381	u2328	m150	HANNAH	So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
L420380	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
L420379	u2328	m150	HANNAH	I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
L420378	u2342	m150	RICHARD	I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
L420377	u2328	m150	HANNAH	Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
L420375	u2328	m150	HANNAH	Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
L420374	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Yes, Mother ...
L420373	u2328	m150	HANNAH	Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
L420372	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Why me?
L420371	u2328	m150	HANNAH	Richard ... come with me, would you ...
L420759	u2342	m150	RICHARD	You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
L420758	u2329	m150	HAROLD	Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
L420757	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Harold ... can I get you anything?
L420756	u2329	m150	HAROLD	Mom expects great things from you ...
L420755	u2329	m150	HAROLD	Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
L420754	u2342	m150	RICHARD	What ... ?
L420753	u2329	m150	HAROLD	Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
L420369	u2329	m150	HAROLD	I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
L420368	u2342	m150	RICHARD	Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
L420367	u2329	m150	HAROLD	I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
L420366	u2342	m150	RICHARD	What'd you say?
L420365	u2329	m150	HAROLD	What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
L420364	u2342	m150	RICHARD	What'd he say?
L420948	u2330	m150	HELMS	"Black Irishman.  Very moving. ""Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity"" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- ""What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?"" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture."
L420947	u2340	m150	NIXON	No.
L420946	u2330	m150	HELMS	"You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  ""The Second Coming""?"
L420945	u2340	m150	NIXON	No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
L420944	u2330	m150	HELMS	Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
L420943	u2340	m150	NIXON	I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
L420942	u2330	m150	HELMS	So President Kennedy thought.
L420941	u2340	m150	NIXON	Cuba would be a small price to pay.
L420940	u2330	m150	HELMS	By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
L420939	u2340	m150	NIXON	But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
L420938	u2330	m150	HELMS	This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
L420937	u2330	m150	HELMS	Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
L420936	u2340	m150	NIXON	CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
L420935	u2330	m150	HELMS	... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
L420934	u2340	m150	NIXON	Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
L420933	u2330	m150	HELMS	It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
L420932	u2340	m150	NIXON	Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
L420931	u2330	m150	HELMS	My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
L420930	u2340	m150	NIXON	Are you tapping Kissinger?
L420929	u2330	m150	HELMS	I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
L420928	u2340	m150	NIXON	Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
L420927	u2330	m150	HELMS	We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
L420926	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes.
L420925	u2330	m150	HELMS	Mr. Castro.
L420924	u2340	m150	NIXON	What?
L420923	u2330	m150	HELMS	It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
L420922	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
L420921	u2330	m150	HELMS	And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
L420920	u2340	m150	NIXON	Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
L420919	u2330	m150	HELMS	And me? ...
L420918	u2340	m150	NIXON	The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
L420917	u2330	m150	HELMS	Current levels may not be sufficient.
L420916	u2340	m150	NIXON	I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
L420915	u2330	m150	HELMS	Not if I give you all the cards ...
L420914	u2340	m150	NIXON	I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
L420913	u2330	m150	HELMS	President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
L420912	u2340	m150	NIXON	I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
L420911	u2330	m150	HELMS	Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
L420908	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes ...
L420907	u2330	m150	HELMS	You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
L420906	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
L420905	u2330	m150	HELMS	Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
L420904	u2340	m150	NIXON	Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
L420903	u2330	m150	HELMS	I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
L420902	u2340	m150	NIXON	Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
L420901	u2330	m150	HELMS	Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
L420900	u2340	m150	NIXON	You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
L420899	u2330	m150	HELMS	"I suppose, ""Mister President,"" you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ..."
L420897	u2330	m150	HELMS	I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
L420896	u2340	m150	NIXON	Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
L420895	u2330	m150	HELMS	And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
L420894	u2340	m150	NIXON	"My friends call me ""Mister President."""
L420893	u2330	m150	HELMS	I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
L420714	u2331	m150	HOOVER	If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
L420713	u2347	m150	TOLSON	Ummm...
L420704	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
L420703	u2347	m150	TOLSON	... little Bobby.
L420684	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
L420683	u2347	m150	TOLSON	It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
L420682	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
L420681	u2347	m150	TOLSON	Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
L420680	u2331	m150	HOOVER	I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
L420646	u2331	m150	HOOVER	He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
L420645	u2347	m150	TOLSON	What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
L421049	u2331	m150	HOOVER	It won't.  As long as I'm here.
L421048	u2340	m150	NIXON	"This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, ""If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself.""  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me."
L421047	u2331	m150	HOOVER	No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
L421046	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
L421045	u2331	m150	HOOVER	I always get my man.
L421044	u2340	m150	NIXON	Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
L421043	u2331	m150	HOOVER	"He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late ""Doctor"" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press."
L421042	u2340	m150	NIXON	Kissinger?
L421041	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
L421040	u2340	m150	NIXON	Who do you think is behind it?
L421039	u2331	m150	HOOVER	That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
L421038	u2340	m150	NIXON	We took his system out.
L421037	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
L421036	u2340	m150	NIXON	We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
L421035	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
L421034	u2340	m150	NIXON	The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
L421033	u2331	m150	HOOVER	"Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: ""The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up.""  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them."
L421032	u2340	m150	NIXON	There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
L420725	u2340	m150	NIXON	The old queen did it on purpose.
L420724	u2331	m150	HOOVER	You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
L420723	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
L420716	u2331	m150	HOOVER	I know ...
L420715	u2340	m150	NIXON	Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
L420712	u2340	m150	NIXON	It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
L420711	u2331	m150	HOOVER	You'll win the nomination.
L420710	u2331	m150	HOOVER	I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
L420709	u2340	m150	NIXON	I never met the man.
L420708	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
L420707	u2340	m150	NIXON	Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
L420706	u2331	m150	HOOVER	I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
L420705	u2340	m150	NIXON	Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
L420702	u2340	m150	NIXON	You should ask Bobby.
L420701	u2331	m150	HOOVER	How about you?  Are you going to win?
L420700	u2340	m150	NIXON	Oh, my goodness ...
L420698	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
L420697	u2340	m150	NIXON	Winning?
L420696	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Thank you for coming, Dick.
L420679	u2331	m150	HOOVER	Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
L420678	u2340	m150	NIXON	My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
L420673	u2340	m150	NIXON	It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
L420672	u2331	m150	HOOVER	It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
L421073	u2332	m150	HUNT	I won't tell him if you won't.
L421072	u2346	m150	STURGIS	So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
L421071	u2332	m150	HUNT	Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
L421070	u2346	m150	STURGIS	Where'd you find him?
L421066	u2332	m150	HUNT	A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
L421065	u2346	m150	STURGIS	Who we working for?
L421064	u2332	m150	HUNT	We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
L421063	u2346	m150	STURGIS	You're fucking me.
L421062	u2332	m150	HUNT	The White House.
L421061	u2346	m150	STURGIS	Why, you got a customer?
L421060	u2346	m150	STURGIS	They're around.
L421059	u2332	m150	HUNT	Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
L421058	u2346	m150	STURGIS	How the fuck did you know?
L420123	u2332	m150	HUNT	Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
L420122	u2335	m150	LIDDY	Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
L420121	u2332	m150	HUNT	Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
L420118	u2335	m150	LIDDY	Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
L420117	u2332	m150	HUNT	Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
L420116	u2335	m150	LIDDY	A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk. Nietzsche.
L420115	u2332	m150	HUNT	Mein Kampf?
L420114	u2332	m150	HUNT	Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
L420113	u2335	m150	LIDDY	Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
L421156	u2340	m150	NIXON	Presidents don't threaten.  They don't have to.  Good day, gentlemen.
L421155	u2333	m150	JONES	Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
L421154	u2340	m150	NIXON	Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
L421151	u2340	m150	NIXON	The American people put me where I am.
L421150	u2333	m150	JONES	... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
L421147	u2333	m150	JONES	I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
L421146	u2340	m150	NIXON	What do you mean, Jack?
L421145	u2333	m150	JONES	Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
L421136	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
L421135	u2333	m150	JONES	And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
L421134	u2340	m150	NIXON	Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
L421133	u2333	m150	JONES	"It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- ""detente"" with the Communists.  ""Detente"" -- it sounds like two fags dancing."
L421132	u2333	m150	JONES	"Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, ""Mister President."""
L421131	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
L421130	u2333	m150	JONES	So, what's this about, Dick?
L420575	u2340	m150	NIXON	Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
L420574	u2333	m150	JONES	That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
L420573	u2340	m150	NIXON	Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
L420572	u2333	m150	JONES	Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
L420571	u2340	m150	NIXON	Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
L420569	u2340	m150	NIXON	Agreed.
L420568	u2333	m150	JONES	Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
L420544	u2333	m150	JONES	He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
L420543	u2340	m150	NIXON	By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
L420542	u2333	m150	JONES	Her name's Sandy ...
L420541	u2340	m150	NIXON	She's quite pretty.
L420540	u2333	m150	JONES	I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
L420538	u2333	m150	JONES	We'll see about that.
L420537	u2340	m150	NIXON	Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
L420534	u2340	m150	NIXON	Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
L420533	u2333	m150	JONES	"Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private ""thing,"" y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet."
L420532	u2340	m150	NIXON	Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
L421522	u2340	m150	NIXON	Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
L421521	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
L421520	u2340	m150	NIXON	... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
L421519	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
L421518	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
L421517	u2340	m150	NIXON	Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
L421516	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	You have many friends ... and admirers ...
L421515	u2340	m150	NIXON	Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
L421514	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
L421513	u2340	m150	NIXON	That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
L421512	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
L421511	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
L421477	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
L421476	u2340	m150	NIXON	... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
L421475	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
L421215	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah ...
L421214	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
L421213	u2340	m150	NIXON	Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
L421212	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
L421211	u2340	m150	NIXON	That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
L421208	u2340	m150	NIXON	Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
L421207	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
L421206	u2340	m150	NIXON	All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
L421205	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
L421204	u2340	m150	NIXON	Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
L421116	u2340	m150	NIXON	Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
L421115	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
L420847	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	We have to entertain the possibility ...
L420846	u2340	m150	NIXON	That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
L420827	u2340	m150	NIXON	This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
L420826	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
L420825	u2340	m150	NIXON	This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
L420818	u2340	m150	NIXON	That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
L420817	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
L420816	u2340	m150	NIXON	That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
L420811	u2340	m150	NIXON	"No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp ""realpolitik"" better than any of us, right, Henry?"
L420810	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
L420782	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	"What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the ""madman,"" Richard Nixon."
L420781	u2340	m150	NIXON	I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
L420780	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	"Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this ""incursion.""  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ..."
L420521	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
L420520	u2340	m150	NIXON	Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
L420519	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	"Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- ""Six Crises"" sounds like a page from Churchill."
L420518	u2340	m150	NIXON	... as the old alliances crumble.
L420249	u2340	m150	NIXON	"We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your ""plumbers"" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!"
L420248	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	There's no other choice.
L420247	u2340	m150	NIXON	Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
L420226	u2340	m150	NIXON	... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
L420225	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
L420215	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
L420214	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, Henry.  I don't.
L420213	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
L420212	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
L420211	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	I beg your pardon --
L420210	u2340	m150	NIXON	Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
L420204	u2340	m150	NIXON	Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
L420203	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
L421089	u2337	m150	MAO	How a fat man gets so many girls.
L421088	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	Secret, Mr. Chairman?
L421087	u2337	m150	MAO	Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
L421086	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
L421085	u2337	m150	MAO	What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
L421084	u2334	m150	KISSINGER	You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
L420993	u2340	m150	NIXON	How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
L420992	u2336	m150	MANOLO	I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
L420991	u2340	m150	NIXON	Why?
L420990	u2336	m150	MANOLO	Yes.
L420989	u2340	m150	NIXON	Did you cry when he died?
L420988	u2336	m150	MANOLO	He was a politician.
L420987	u2340	m150	NIXON	You don't think he was a hero?
L420986	u2336	m150	MANOLO	That was Mr. Kennedy.
L420985	u2340	m150	NIXON	We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
L420984	u2336	m150	MANOLO	Yes, Mr. President.
L420983	u2340	m150	NIXON	Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
L420982	u2336	m150	MANOLO	Of course.
L420981	u2340	m150	NIXON	Just ... uh ... you know.
L420980	u2336	m150	MANOLO	I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
L421095	u2337	m150	MAO	The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
L421094	u2340	m150	NIXON	Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
L421093	u2337	m150	MAO	You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
L421092	u2340	m150	NIXON	I was the lesser of two evils.
L421091	u2337	m150	MAO	You know, I voted for you in your last election.
L421083	u2337	m150	MAO	That has the added virtue of being true.
L421082	u2340	m150	NIXON	Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
L421081	u2337	m150	MAO	Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
L421079	u2340	m150	NIXON	We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
L421078	u2337	m150	MAO	Looks can be deceiving ...
L421077	u2340	m150	NIXON	I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
L421142	u2340	m150	NIXON	Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
L421141	u2338	m150	MITCH	How about Kissinger along with him?
L421140	u2340	m150	NIXON	We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
L421139	u2338	m150	MITCH	What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
L421138	u2340	m150	NIXON	Free, if you're the president.
L421137	u2338	m150	MITCH	So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
L420581	u2340	m150	NIXON	I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
L420580	u2338	m150	MITCH	You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
L420579	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
L420858	u2340	m150	NIXON	Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
L420857	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
L420855	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	That was a long time ago.
L420854	u2340	m150	NIXON	It broke my heart when Harold died.
L420853	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
L420852	u2340	m150	NIXON	They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
L420851	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
L420850	u2340	m150	NIXON	My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
L420849	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	You all right?
L420833	u2340	m150	NIXON	How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
L420832	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
L420802	u2340	m150	NIXON	Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
L420801	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	"One of the fathers was on the TV saying, ""My child was not a bum.""  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph."
L420800	u2340	m150	NIXON	Jesus Christ!
L420799	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
L420798	u2340	m150	NIXON	How many?
L420624	u2340	m150	NIXON	Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
L420623	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
L420622	u2340	m150	NIXON	Uh, wait ...
L420529	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
L420528	u2340	m150	NIXON	Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
L420527	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	That'll be the day.
L420526	u2340	m150	NIXON	You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
L420525	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
L420524	u2340	m150	NIXON	Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
L420523	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
L420522	u2340	m150	NIXON	Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
L420485	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
L420484	u2340	m150	NIXON	Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
L420483	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
L420482	u2340	m150	NIXON	You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
L420481	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
L420244	u2340	m150	NIXON	When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
L420243	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
L420242	u2340	m150	NIXON	But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
L420241	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	And Dick beat the shit out of them.
L420240	u2340	m150	NIXON	You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
L420239	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	The lie?
L420235	u2340	m150	NIXON	"You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: ""Until you talk you're all getting shot.""  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ..."
L420234	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	It was illegal, what he did.
L420220	u2340	m150	NIXON	... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
L420219	u2339	m150	MITCHELL	We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
L420720	u2340	m150	NIXON	... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
L420719	u2347	m150	TOLSON	... Use his women.
L420718	u2340	m150	NIXON	I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
L420717	u2347	m150	TOLSON	... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
L420695	u2347	m150	TOLSON	Mr. Nixon.
L420694	u2340	m150	NIXON	Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
L420675	u2340	m150	NIXON	... but it was all we had.
L420674	u2347	m150	TOLSON	But it was all we had.
L420671	u2340	m150	NIXON	You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
L420670	u2347	m150	TOLSON	... give me a break, Mary.
L421017	u2340	m150	NIXON	But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
L421016	u2345	m150	STUDENT 2	Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
L421011	u2340	m150	NIXON	That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
L421010	u2345	m150	STUDENT 2	What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
L421003	u2340	m150	NIXON	Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
L421002	u2345	m150	STUDENT 2	Ernie Davis.
L421001	u2340	m150	NIXON	The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
L421000	u2345	m150	STUDENT 2	Syracuse.
L420999	u2340	m150	NIXON	Where you from?
L420998	u2345	m150	STUDENT 2	You're shittin' me.
L420997	u2340	m150	NIXON	Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
L420567	u2340	m150	NIXON	She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
L420566	u2344	m150	SANDY	Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
L420565	u2340	m150	NIXON	Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
L420564	u2344	m150	SANDY	... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
L420563	u2340	m150	NIXON	Oh yeah, he's good.
L420562	u2344	m150	SANDY	Elvis I like, too.
L420561	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
L420560	u2344	m150	SANDY	I like jazz ...
L420559	u2340	m150	NIXON	What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
L420558	u2344	m150	SANDY	Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
L420557	u2340	m150	NIXON	... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
L420550	u2344	m150	SANDY	Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
L420549	u2340	m150	NIXON	That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
L420548	u2340	m150	NIXON	Hello ...
L420547	u2344	m150	SANDY	Hi.
L421024	u2340	m150	NIXON	Maybe I am.
L421023	u2348	m150	YOUNG WOMAN	It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
L421022	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
L421021	u2348	m150	YOUNG WOMAN	Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
L421020	u2340	m150	NIXON	There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
L421019	u2348	m150	YOUNG WOMAN	Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
L421015	u2340	m150	NIXON	I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
L421014	u2348	m150	YOUNG WOMAN	No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
L421005	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes, I understand that.
L421004	u2348	m150	YOUNG WOMAN	We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
L421466	u2340	m150	NIXON	"... and get rid of all these ""goddamns"" and ""Jesus Christs""!"
L421465	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	"Or we could write ""expletive deleted."""
L421461	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	Well, we could delete it.
L421460	u2340	m150	NIXON	"And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. ""Niggers""!"
L421429	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, ""Mea culpa, mea culpa,"" while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!"
L421428	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	No, sir ...
L421427	u2340	m150	NIXON	There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
L421416	u2340	m150	NIXON	Fire him.
L421415	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	Yes, yes.
L421414	u2340	m150	NIXON	Of them.
L421413	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	Sir?
L421412	u2340	m150	NIXON	Proud?
L421411	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	Compassionate.  Grateful.
L421410	u2340	m150	NIXON	So I'm supposed to be ...
L421409	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	POWs.  And their families.
L421408	u2340	m150	NIXON	What's in there?
L421407	u2340	m150	NIXON	What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
L421406	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	That's right.
L421405	u2340	m150	NIXON	Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
L421400	u2340	m150	NIXON	They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
L421399	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	Sir?
L421398	u2340	m150	NIXON	You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
L421182	u2340	m150	NIXON	Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
L421181	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	Bernstein.
L421126	u2340	m150	NIXON	Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
L421125	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
L421123	u2340	m150	NIXON	The hell with 'em.
L421122	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
L420820	u2340	m150	NIXON	Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
L420819	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
L420813	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
L420812	u2340	m150	NIXON	We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
L420618	u2340	m150	NIXON	"And we got the ""big mo""!  We're back!"
L420617	u2349	m150	ZIEGLER	We got the press this time!
L421538	u2341	m150	PAT	There'll be time for that.
L421537	u2340	m150	NIXON	No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
L421536	u2341	m150	PAT	It'll be over soon.
L421446	u2341	m150	PAT	No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
L421445	u2340	m150	NIXON	They were for me.  They're mine.
L421444	u2341	m150	PAT	And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
L421442	u2340	m150	NIXON	You're drunk!
L421441	u2341	m150	PAT	I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
L421440	u2340	m150	NIXON	Don't be ridiculous!
L421439	u2341	m150	PAT	You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
L421437	u2341	m150	PAT	What matters to me is whether you understand it.
L421436	u2340	m150	NIXON	You can't expect me to explain that to you.
L421435	u2341	m150	PAT	Why didn't you?
L421350	u2341	m150	PAT	Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
L421349	u2340	m150	NIXON	Thank you.
L421348	u2341	m150	PAT	No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
L421345	u2340	m150	NIXON	Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
L421344	u2341	m150	PAT	I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
L421342	u2341	m150	PAT	Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
L421341	u2340	m150	NIXON	Hiding what?
L421340	u2341	m150	PAT	I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
L421339	u2340	m150	NIXON	And what am I doing?
L421338	u2341	m150	PAT	You.  What' you're doing --
L421337	u2340	m150	NIXON	What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
L421335	u2340	m150	NIXON	No.
L421334	u2341	m150	PAT	Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
L421333	u2340	m150	NIXON	Tomorrow.
L421332	u2341	m150	PAT	When?
L421331	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes.
L421110	u2341	m150	PAT	It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
L421109	u2340	m150	NIXON	Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
L421104	u2340	m150	NIXON	How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
L421103	u2341	m150	PAT	Congratulations, Dick.
L421101	u2341	m150	PAT	You're a long way from Whittier.
L421100	u2340	m150	NIXON	Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
L421099	u2341	m150	PAT	Penny for your thoughts.
L420978	u2341	m150	PAT	But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
L420977	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
L420975	u2340	m150	NIXON	You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
L420974	u2341	m150	PAT	Sometimes I think that's what you want.
L420973	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
L420972	u2341	m150	PAT	You personally?
L420971	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes!
L420970	u2341	m150	PAT	They're all your enemies?
L420969	u2340	m150	NIXON	I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
L420968	u2341	m150	PAT	Then what are you scared of, honey?
L420967	u2340	m150	NIXON	I do.  I do.  In my own way.
L420966	u2341	m150	PAT	No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
L420965	u2340	m150	NIXON	I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
L420964	u2341	m150	PAT	Yes, it's been a long time ...
L420963	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
L420962	u2341	m150	PAT	I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
L420961	u2340	m150	NIXON	Because ... I have to relax.
L420960	u2341	m150	PAT	Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
L420959	u2340	m150	NIXON	Are you okay?
L420958	u2341	m150	PAT	I've missed you.
L420957	u2340	m150	NIXON	Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
L420952	u2340	m150	NIXON	"I asked him, ""Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?""  And he said, ""Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live."" ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?"
L420951	u2341	m150	PAT	He looked old, didn't he?
L420641	u2341	m150	PAT	Will you ... would you kiss me?
L420640	u2340	m150	NIXON	Anything.
L420639	u2341	m150	PAT	Can I just ask for one thing?
L420638	u2340	m150	NIXON	You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
L420637	u2341	m150	PAT	Then I'll be there for you.
L420636	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
L420635	u2341	m150	PAT	And then you'll be happy?
L420634	u2340	m150	NIXON	This.  Above all.
L420633	u2341	m150	PAT	Do you really want this, Dick?
L420632	u2340	m150	NIXON	It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
L420630	u2340	m150	NIXON	I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
L420629	u2341	m150	PAT	I don't want them to love me.
L420628	u2340	m150	NIXON	They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
L420627	u2341	m150	PAT	You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
L420626	u2340	m150	NIXON	Buddy? ...
L420621	u2340	m150	NIXON	We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
L420620	u2341	m150	PAT	Were you planning to tell me?
L420596	u2341	m150	PAT	They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
L420595	u2340	m150	NIXON	No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
L420594	u2341	m150	PAT	Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
L420593	u2340	m150	NIXON	De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
L420592	u2341	m150	PAT	You don't have to go.
L420591	u2340	m150	NIXON	He doesn't want me at the funeral.
L420590	u2341	m150	PAT	Dick, you should call Bobby.
L420437	u2340	m150	NIXON	I'll never run again.  I promise.
L420436	u2341	m150	PAT	Is that the truth?
L420435	u2340	m150	NIXON	Yeah ... I'm out.
L420434	u2341	m150	PAT	Are you serious?
L420433	u2340	m150	NIXON	I'll do it.  No more.
L420432	u2340	m150	NIXON	If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
L420431	u2341	m150	PAT	We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
L420430	u2340	m150	NIXON	Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
L420429	u2341	m150	PAT	Dick, don't...
L420427	u2341	m150	PAT	That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
L420426	u2340	m150	NIXON	This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
L420425	u2341	m150	PAT	No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
L420424	u2340	m150	NIXON	Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
L420423	u2341	m150	PAT	You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
L420422	u2340	m150	NIXON	It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
L420421	u2341	m150	PAT	The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
L420420	u2340	m150	NIXON	My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
L420419	u2341	m150	PAT	I want a divorce.
L420418	u2340	m150	NIXON	What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
L420416	u2341	m150	PAT	Not that.  Us.
L420415	u2340	m150	NIXON	I'll concede in the morning.
L420414	u2341	m150	PAT	It's over, Dick.
L420413	u2340	m150	NIXON	Amen to that.
L420412	u2341	m150	PAT	No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
L420411	u2340	m150	NIXON	Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
L420407	u2340	m150	NIXON	Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
L420406	u2341	m150	PAT	I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
L420405	u2340	m150	NIXON	I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
L420404	u2341	m150	PAT	You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
L420403	u2340	m150	NIXON	Thank you, Fidel Castro.
L420363	u2340	m150	NIXON	You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
L420362	u2341	m150	PAT	You're not a failure, Dick.
L420361	u2340	m150	NIXON	Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
L420360	u2341	m150	PAT	It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
L420359	u2340	m150	NIXON	What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
L420358	u2341	m150	PAT	We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
L420357	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
L420356	u2341	m150	PAT	It makes us human ...
L420355	u2340	m150	NIXON	It's hard to lose ...
L420354	u2341	m150	PAT	I know ...
L420353	u2340	m150	NIXON	We lost ...
L420517	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	"Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this ""crisis"" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it."
L420516	u2340	m150	NIXON	No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
L420515	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
L420514	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
L420513	u2340	m150	NIXON	Some say you are, Rocky.
L420512	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
L420511	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  ""Six Crises."""
L420509	u2340	m150	NIXON	You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
L420508	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Whatcha mean by that?
L420507	u2340	m150	NIXON	Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
L420506	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
L420505	u2340	m150	NIXON	Checkers of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
L420504	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	"The ""crises""?"
L420503	u2340	m150	NIXON	What?
L420502	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
L420501	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it ""Six Crises.""  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write."
L420500	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	To what?
L420499	u2340	m150	NIXON	But being out of the game gives me time to write.
L420498	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Someday, Dick.
L420497	u2340	m150	NIXON	Lost.
L420496	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Won or lost?
L420495	u2340	m150	NIXON	Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
L420494	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
L420493	u2340	m150	NIXON	Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
L420492	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
L420491	u2340	m150	NIXON	"Well enough.  You're looking ""happy,"" Nelson."
L420490	u2343	m150	ROCKEFELLER	Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
L457288	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
L457287	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
L457286	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
L457280	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
L457279	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
L457278	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
L457277	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
L457276	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- and the listless ones do the binding.
L457271	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
L457270	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
L457269	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
L456504	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
L456503	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
L456497	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	Then what's he doing here?
L456496	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	He's a writer, not a madman.
L456495	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
L456494	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Once or twice.
L456493	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
L456490	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	No one's forcing you to listen.
L456489	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
L456488	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --
L457175	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	...a poker... he took a poker from the fire...
L457174	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --
L457170	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --
L457169	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --
L457154	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles...
L457153	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle...
L457138	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Now give the signal.
L457137	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	At your service, Count.
L457136	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
L457135	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
L457134	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
L457133	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	Marquis? Is that you?
L457131	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
L457130	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
L457099	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You'll hate me now, won't you?
L457098	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
L457097	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	What? What've I done?
L457096	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Go back to your room. Quickly.
L457094	u2532	m164	COULMIER	They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
L457093	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Why not?
L457092	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
L457091	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Mother's not half so blind as you.
L457090	u2532	m164	COULMIER	By whom? The Marquis?
L457089	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
L457088	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Turn you out?
L457087	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't turn us out, Abbe.
L457069	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I've you to look after me, haven't I?
L457068	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
L457067	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Is that a promise you can truly keep?
L457066	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
L457065	u2532	m164	COULMIER	The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
L457064	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
L457063	u2532	m164	COULMIER	In part, yes.
L457015	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
L457014	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
L457013	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
L457012	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
L457011	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Ow!
L457010	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
L457009	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But why must you indulge in his pornography?
L457008	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
L457007	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
L457000	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Not now, or we're both done for.
L456999	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
L456763	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
L456762	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Has he hurt you?
L456548	u2532	m164	COULMIER	The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
L456547	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Yes, Abbe?
L456546	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madeleine --
L456486	u2532	m164	COULMIER	We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
L456485	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
L457263	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
L457262	u2545	m164	VALCOUR	I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
L457261	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I must grant him his last rites.
L457260	u2545	m164	VALCOUR	Mustn't do that, sir.
L457259	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Free his mouth.
L456566	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
L456565	u2545	m164	VALCOUR	They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
L457244	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Of course.
L457243	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Surely you'll grant me a final word.
L457242	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'm here.
L457241	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Abbe de Coulmier!
L457238	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
L457237	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
L457233	u2532	m164	COULMIER	We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
L457232	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
L457231	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Then it must've been love --
L457230	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	NEVER!
L457229	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Was it impotence?
L457228	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Who's to say I did not?
L457227	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Why was it you never took her by force?
L457226	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Go to hell!
L457225	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
L457224	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
L457223	u2532	m164	COULMIER	AND DID YOU?
L457222	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
L457221	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I know, because I felt it myself --
L457220	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't confuse one organ with another --
L457219	u2532	m164	COULMIER	-- the passion in your heart --
L457218	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	-- that was lust --
L457217	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I saw the longing in your eye --
L457216	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
L457215	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's no secret that you loved her.
L457214	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
L457213	u2532	m164	COULMIER	An innocent child is dead.
L457212	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
L457211	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Your words drove Bouchon to --
L457210	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
L456987	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Your wig. Remove your wig.
L456986	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
L456980	u2532	m164	COULMIER	NOW STRIP.
L456979	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
L456978	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
L456977	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Coulmier, you animal!
L456976	u2532	m164	COULMIER	OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
L456975	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
L456974	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
L456973	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	A night spent with the partner of my choice.
L456972	u2532	m164	COULMIER	What on earth would that require?
L456971	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
L456970	u2532	m164	COULMIER	What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
L456969	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	A man after my own heart...
L456968	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
L456937	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
L456936	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
L456935	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
L456934	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Because your writing continues, unchecked.
L456933	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
L456932	u2532	m164	COULMIER	-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
L456931	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	-- water! --
L456930	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
L456929	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
L456925	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Valcour. His chair.
L456924	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
L456923	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
L456922	u2532	m164	COULMIER	His rug.
L456921	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
L456799	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	THEN BUGGER ME!
L456798	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Good day, Marquis.
L456797	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
L456796	u2532	m164	COULMIER	That's enough.
L456795	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Part the gates of heaven, as it were --
L456794	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
L456793	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
L456792	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You always do.
L456791	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I have a proposition.
L456790	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
L456789	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
L456788	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
L456787	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
L456786	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
L456785	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
L456784	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
L456783	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
L456781	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
L456780	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	What the devil --
L456779	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
L456778	u2532	m164	COULMIER	How can one man possibly be so selfish?
L456777	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	He can't do that to me.
L456765	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
L456764	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You mean to take us all down with you?
L456665	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
L456664	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you only mean to dupe me again --
L456661	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Do I have your word?
L456660	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
L456658	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You among them?
L456657	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
L456656	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
L456655	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Mightier than the sword indeed.
L456654	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
L456653	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	They can't be serious.
L456652	u2532	m164	COULMIER	More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
L456651	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
L456650	u2532	m164	COULMIER	One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
L456649	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
L456648	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
L456647	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
L456646	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
L456645	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
L456644	u2532	m164	COULMIER	And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
L456643	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	There I was taxed; it's true.
L456642	u2532	m164	COULMIER	"It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like ""nipple"" and ""pikestaff"" --"
L456641	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	And --?
L456640	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Enough to discern its tenor.
L456639	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
L456638	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
L456637	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
L456636	u2532	m164	COULMIER	What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
L456635	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
L456563	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'll fill page after page, I promise.
L456562	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
L456561	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't be so sure.
L456560	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
L456559	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
L456558	u2532	m164	COULMIER	In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
L456557	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
L456556	u2532	m164	COULMIER	We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
L456555	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
L456551	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
L456550	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's not even noon --
L456549	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
L457293	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
L457292	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
L457253	u2532	m164	COULMIER	No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
L457252	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Will you sleep soundly tonight?
L457251	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
L457250	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And you? It must've been an ordeal.
L457249	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Poorly.
L457248	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	How is the patient faring?
L457247	u2532	m164	COULMIER	And my own.
L457246	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
L457206	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	HER NAME, ABBE.
L457205	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
L457204	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
L457203	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
L457202	u2532	m164	COULMIER	As you say, Doctor.
L457002	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You'd suffer in her stead?
L457001	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
L456996	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
L456995	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	This child let loose the beast from its cage --
L456994	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
L456993	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	He'll do no such thing.
L456909	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	What could cause a tincture like this?
L456908	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
L456775	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
L456774	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'll do everything in my power --
L456773	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
L456772	u2532	m164	COULMIER	That's not our intent --
L456771	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
L456770	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	No. It most certainly was not.
L456769	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It was not inspired by circumstance.
L456768	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Of course.
L456767	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It was fiction, of course.
L456724	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Oh indeed?
L456723	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
L456676	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
L456675	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I have.
L456674	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
L456673	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
L456672	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He's sworn to obedience.
L456671	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And --?
L456670	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
L456669	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Well?
L456626	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
L456625	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And place my reputation at stake?
L456624	u2532	m164	COULMIER	On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
L456623	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You find this amusing, do you?
L456622	u2532	m164	COULMIER	A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
L456621	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You're a sentimental man.
L456620	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
L456619	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
L456618	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But he's one among some two hundred wards --
L456617	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
L456616	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Shut down?
L456615	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
L456614	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Yes?
L456613	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
L456612	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
L456611	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
L456610	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You have to believe me, I had no idea --
L456608	u2532	m164	COULMIER	For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
L456607	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Do you favor its publication?
L456606	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
L456605	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Well...?
L456604	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Oh. That.
L456603	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And his writing?
L456602	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
L456601	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
L456600	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
L456599	u2532	m164	COULMIER	A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
L456598	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And he's never once attempted escape?
L456597	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
L456596	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	His wife's?
L456595	u2532	m164	COULMIER	His wife's influence.
L456594	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
L456589	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
L456588	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
L456587	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
L456586	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
L456585	u2532	m164	COULMIER	A few indiscretions in his youth.
L456584	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
L456577	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
L456576	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
L456575	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
L456574	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
L456573	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It's a formality; truly.
L456572	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Of course.
L456571	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
L456570	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
L456471	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
L456470	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	Yes?
L456469	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
L456468	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	But I am history.
L456467	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
L456466	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	As for the author... shoot him.
L456464	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	Enough!
L456463	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --
L456697	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben?; I look to the future.
L456696	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	"His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  ""There but for the grace of God""... eh, Doctor?"
L456482	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	"Do you know how I define ""idealism,"" Monsieur Delben??"
L456481	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
L456480	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
L456476	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben?. Mine is a higher mission.
L456475	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	Quite.
L456474	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
L456902	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
L456901	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
L456457	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
L456456	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I'll be waiting.
L456455	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
L456454	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I'll pass the word on, then.
L456453	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
L456452	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Here it is; the last chapter.
L456760	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
L456759	u2535	m164	INGENUE	What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
L456758	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
L456757	u2535	m164	INGENUE	I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
L456756	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	"I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry ""no more!"""
L456754	u2535	m164	INGENUE	Was ever a man more risqu?? He wants to take me every way!
L456753	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
L456746	u2535	m164	INGENUE	Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou?!
L456745	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
L456738	u2535	m164	INGENUE	Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
L456737	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
L457062	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
L457061	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
L456911	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
L456910	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
L456900	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Well worth the dig!
L456899	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Yes?
L456898	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman...
L456897	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
L456896	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	A habitu? of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years.
L456894	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Come now, darling, give it a read.
L456893	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
L456892	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
L457159	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	"What shall I ready? asked Fanchon. ""My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"""
L457158	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	...yes, I've got that bit...
L457126	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
L457125	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
L457124	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
L457123	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
L457122	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
L457121	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
L457120	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Go on, child.
L457119	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
L457118	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
L457117	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
L457116	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It needn't be; not if you've another story.
L457114	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
L457113	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
L457112	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
L457111	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
L457110	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
L457109	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
L457108	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's only been described to me. In your books.
L457107	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Surely you've seen a man naked.
L457106	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
L457105	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	They've taken your clothes?
L456950	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I don't believe it!
L456949	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
L456946	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
L456945	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	What have they done to you now?
L456541	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	What's that then?
L456540	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
L456539	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
L456538	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
L456537	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's a long story, this one.
L456533	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
L456532	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
L456531	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
L456530	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	A kiss for each page.
L456528	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Fiendishly so.
L456527	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Is it terribly erotic?
L456526	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Most assuredly.
L456525	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Is it awfully violent?
L456524	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
L456523	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
L456522	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
L456521	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
L456520	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	There's something else I want from you.
L456519	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
L456518	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
L456517	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
L456515	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
L456514	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
L456513	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
L456512	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Did I frighten you?
L456509	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
L456508	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't start --
L456507	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'm hungry for a proper visit.
L457078	u2543	m164	SIMONE	No. But tell him I would.
L457077	u2539	m164	MONSIEUR PROUIX	You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
L457076	u2543	m164	SIMONE	Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
L457075	u2539	m164	MONSIEUR PROUIX	By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond...
L457074	u2543	m164	SIMONE	Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
L457073	u2539	m164	MONSIEUR PROUIX	...your wife.
L457035	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
L457034	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
L457033	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
L457025	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
L457024	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
L457021	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
L457020	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
L457019	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	This is neither the time nor the place --
L457018	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
L457017	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Good God, Marquise --
L456875	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
L456874	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Of course.
L456873	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
L456872	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And I in yours.
L456871	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I am eternally in your debt.
L456868	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
L456867	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Don't toy with me, Doctor.
L456865	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
L456864	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- words alone are insufficient.
L456863	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Oh, but I am!
L456862	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
L456861	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
L456860	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	What thought is that?
L456859	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
L456858	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	It's tainted money, Doctor.
L456857	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
L456856	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I am not a wealthy woman.
L456855	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
L456854	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
L456853	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
L456852	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
L456848	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
L456847	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
L456844	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
L456843	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
L456842	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I pray you: be succinct.
L456841	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
L456840	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
L456839	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
L456838	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
L456829	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
L456828	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
L456827	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
L456826	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
L456825	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
L456824	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
L456821	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
L456820	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	They've put you up to this, haven't they?
L456819	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
L456818	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You've come to lecture me?
L456817	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
L456816	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
L456815	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	How was I to know, my darling?
L456813	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Forgive me, I beg you --
L456812	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
L456811	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	....shame on you, truly...
L456810	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
L456884	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You prefer a book to your husband's company?
L456883	u2543	m164	SIMONE	I'd rather read, thank-you.
L456882	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
L456881	u2543	m164	SIMONE	Very much.
L456880	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Doesn't that please you?
L456743	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Do as I say.
L456742	u2543	m164	SIMONE	But it's just begun --
L456741	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Leave at once --
L469160	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
L469159	u2557	m165	WELLES	That poor woman.
L469154	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
L469153	u2557	m165	WELLES	Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
L469152	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
L469151	u2557	m165	WELLES	Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
L469150	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Of being found out. Of not being a genius
L469147	u2557	m165	WELLES	Am I?
L469146	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	You're just scared.
L469145	u2557	m165	WELLES	I wonder sometimes.
L469144	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
L469143	u2557	m165	WELLES	Not you too
L469142	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	So you ever gonna do a picture?
L469091	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Last week would this be?
L469090	u2557	m165	WELLES	No, when I was but a tender lad--
L469089	u2557	m165	WELLES	Ever met Walter Winchell?
L469654	u2551	m165	MARION	But I am That's the killer, honey.
L469653	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
L469652	u2551	m165	MARION	The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
L469651	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Uh-huh
L469650	u2551	m165	MARION	You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
L469649	u2551	m165	MARION	Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
L469648	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
L469647	u2551	m165	MARION	Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
L469646	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Sure
L469645	u2551	m165	MARION	I did my best but, well, you know me
L469643	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	And he did.
L469642	u2551	m165	MARION	When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
L469131	u2551	m165	MARION	He needs me here.
L469130	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Sure you can, just--
L469129	u2551	m165	MARION	I can't
L469128	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
L469127	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Mm.
L469126	u2551	m165	MARION	And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
L469125	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
L469124	u2551	m165	MARION	Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
L469123	u2551	m165	MARION	It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
L469122	u2551	m165	MARION	With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
L469121	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
L469120	u2551	m165	MARION	That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
L469119	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
L469118	u2551	m165	MARION	God, these parties are the worst
L469072	u2546	m165	CAROLE LOMBARD	Houdini mice.
L469071	u2551	m165	MARION	And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
L469815	u2547	m165	HEARST	So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
L469814	u2557	m165	WELLES	Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
L469813	u2547	m165	HEARST	Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
L469812	u2557	m165	WELLES	Do you?
L469811	u2547	m165	HEARST	I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
L469107	u2557	m165	WELLES	I'll remember that.
L469106	u2547	m165	HEARST	In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
L469105	u2557	m165	WELLES	So I've been told.
L469104	u2547	m165	HEARST	Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
L469101	u2557	m165	WELLES	To make pictures.
L469100	u2547	m165	HEARST	I see. And you are in California for what reason?
L469099	u2557	m165	WELLES	And director.
L469098	u2547	m165	HEARST	The actor
L469097	u2557	m165	WELLES	My name is Orson Welles
L469096	u2547	m165	HEARST	Who are you, sir?
L469495	u2552	m165	MAYER	Yeah
L469494	u2547	m165	HEARST	See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
L469492	u2552	m165	MAYER	Bel Air is restricted.
L469491	u2547	m165	HEARST	Why is that, Louis?
L469490	u2547	m165	HEARST	Oh, why is that?
L469489	u2552	m165	MAYER	You know that can't happen.
L469488	u2547	m165	HEARST	And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
L469485	u2552	m165	MAYER	Yeah
L469484	u2547	m165	HEARST	Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
L469483	u2552	m165	MAYER	Uh-hub.
L469482	u2547	m165	HEARST	Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
L469481	u2552	m165	MAYER	Over at RKO?
L469480	u2547	m165	HEARST	Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
L469478	u2547	m165	HEARST	Hope you don't mind my popping in--
L469477	u2552	m165	MAYER	Randolph!
L469476	u2547	m165	HEARST	Louis
L469641	u2547	m165	HEARST	There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
L469640	u2551	m165	MARION	I don't want you to--
L469639	u2547	m165	HEARST	castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
L469638	u2547	m165	HEARST	No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
L469637	u2551	m165	MARION	I just want to understand--
L469636	u2547	m165	HEARST	I will not have this in my home.
L469635	u2551	m165	MARION	Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
L469634	u2547	m165	HEARST	You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
L469633	u2551	m165	MARION	Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
L469632	u2547	m165	HEARST	You are repellant when you drink.
L469631	u2551	m165	MARION	You will not walk out on me
L469630	u2547	m165	HEARST	That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
L469629	u2551	m165	MARION	But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
L469628	u2547	m165	HEARST	Not for me.
L469627	u2551	m165	MARION	There's a different between want and
L469626	u2547	m165	HEARST	I wanted it
L469625	u2551	m165	MARION	Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
L469624	u2547	m165	HEARST	You needn't use that language with me
L469623	u2551	m165	MARION	I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
L469622	u2547	m165	HEARST	It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
L469621	u2551	m165	MARION	That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
L469620	u2551	m165	MARION	You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
L469619	u2547	m165	HEARST	You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
L469618	u2551	m165	MARION	You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
L469617	u2547	m165	HEARST	There is nothing to discuss-
L469616	u2551	m165	MARION	You gotta wake up now. Pops.
L469615	u2547	m165	HEARST	"We are in no ""pickle"" -- as you would euphemistically have it."
L469614	u2551	m165	MARION	I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
L469613	u2547	m165	HEARST	I will not defend my life to you--
L469612	u2551	m165	MARION	A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
L469611	u2547	m165	HEARST	There's nothing to explain
L469610	u2551	m165	MARION	Then you explain it to me?!
L469570	u2551	m165	MARION	I am not that woman.
L469569	u2547	m165	HEARST	This picture--
L469568	u2551	m165	MARION	Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
L469567	u2547	m165	HEARST	Marion--
L469566	u2551	m165	MARION	Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
L469565	u2551	m165	MARION	Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
L469522	u2547	m165	HEARST	One . . . buys things.
L469521	u2551	m165	MARION	How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
L469520	u2547	m165	HEARST	Yes.
L469519	u2551	m165	MARION	We're 125 million dollars in debt?
L469517	u2551	m165	MARION	How much?
L469516	u2547	m165	HEARST	It's not really--
L469515	u2551	m165	MARION	How much?
L469514	u2547	m165	HEARST	The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
L469513	u2551	m165	MARION	Pops
L469512	u2547	m165	HEARST	Nothing for you to worry about, darling
L469511	u2551	m165	MARION	How bad is it?
L469507	u2551	m165	MARION	Don't
L469506	u2547	m165	HEARST	He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
L469505	u2551	m165	MARION	You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
L469504	u2547	m165	HEARST	The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
L469298	u2551	m165	MARION	Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
L469297	u2547	m165	HEARST	She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
L469296	u2551	m165	MARION	There. That's right.
L469294	u2547	m165	HEARST	Darling, I talked to Millicent.
L469293	u2551	m165	MARION	This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
L469158	u2551	m165	MARION	There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
L469157	u2547	m165	HEARST	There's no call for that language-
L469156	u2551	m165	MARION	Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
L469468	u2547	m165	HEARST	Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
L469467	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	I want blood
L469466	u2547	m165	HEARST	And how do you feel when you are lied to?
L469465	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
L469464	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	He lied to me
L469463	u2547	m165	HEARST	Please be quiet.
L469462	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Sir, I-
L469461	u2547	m165	HEARST	I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
L469460	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Sir?
L469459	u2547	m165	HEARST	Why did we not know about this sooner?
L469458	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Sir? 
L469457	u2547	m165	HEARST	Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
L469456	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
L469455	u2547	m165	HEARST	Thank you for your time
L469453	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	The drinking.
L469452	u2547	m165	HEARST	Yes?
L469451	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
L469450	u2547	m165	HEARST	How so?
L469449	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
L469413	u2557	m165	WELLES	A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own.
L469412	u2548	m165	JOSEPH COTTON	"love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. """
L469411	u2548	m165	JOSEPH COTTON	"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
L469410	u2557	m165	WELLES	You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
L469409	u2548	m165	JOSEPH COTTON	We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
L469408	u2557	m165	WELLES	This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
L469407	u2557	m165	WELLES	Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
L469406	u2548	m165	JOSEPH COTTON	I can't remember the lines!
L469405	u2557	m165	WELLES	Keep filming.
L469404	u2548	m165	JOSEPH COTTON	You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--""  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--"
L469403	u2557	m165	WELLES	Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me.
L469263	u2557	m165	WELLES	I am not doing Hearst.
L469262	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
L469261	u2557	m165	WELLES	That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
L469260	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	A delicious amalgamation, is it?
L469259	u2557	m165	WELLES	Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
L469258	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
L469257	u2557	m165	WELLES	We're using-
L469256	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
L469247	u2557	m165	WELLES	What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
L469246	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Huh?
L469245	u2557	m165	WELLES	Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
L469503	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	You are talking to him.
L469502	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Can I talk to Hearst?
L469501	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
L469500	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Oh for God's sake, Louella-
L469499	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
L469498	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
L469497	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
L469443	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Uh-huh
L469442	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Hearst?
L469441	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	That's right
L469440	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	He personally asked you to?
L469439	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
L469438	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
L469437	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	I wanna see the picture today
L469436	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	No -- no -- I mean--
L469435	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	You drink at 10 am, do you?
L469434	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
L469433	u2549	m165	LOUELLA	Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
L469843	u2550	m165	MANK	Yeah, you're probably right.
L469842	u2557	m165	WELLES	You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
L469838	u2550	m165	MANK	Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
L469837	u2557	m165	WELLES	What have I done?
L469835	u2557	m165	WELLES	George...
L469834	u2550	m165	MANK	Shit
L469826	u2550	m165	MANK	Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
L469825	u2557	m165	WELLES	Mank!
L469824	u2550	m165	MANK	Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
L469823	u2557	m165	WELLES	You gonna watch?
L469793	u2550	m165	MANK	This ain't George's doing--!
L469792	u2557	m165	WELLES	YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
L469777	u2550	m165	MANK	Kinda.
L469776	u2557	m165	WELLES	Is that from one of the Gospels?
L469557	u2550	m165	MANK	I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
L469556	u2557	m165	WELLES	You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
L469555	u2550	m165	MANK	They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
L469554	u2557	m165	WELLES	It's too late. The movie's made
L469553	u2550	m165	MANK	If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
L469551	u2557	m165	WELLES	What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
L469550	u2550	m165	MANK	Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
L469549	u2557	m165	WELLES	What does this have to do with--?
L469548	u2550	m165	MANK	Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
L469547	u2557	m165	WELLES	Christ.
L469546	u2550	m165	MANK	This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
L469545	u2557	m165	WELLES	So they're Jews. . .
L469544	u2550	m165	MANK	"Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word ""Jew"" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating."
L469543	u2550	m165	MANK	Jews. She's talking about Jews.
L469542	u2557	m165	WELLES	Hedy Lamarr?
L469541	u2550	m165	MANK	"No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. ""Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees"" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?"
L469540	u2557	m165	WELLES	Well, at least she's off KANE today
L469539	u2550	m165	MANK	And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?
L469538	u2557	m165	WELLES	"No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A ""puny upstart"" or a ""spoiled dilettante"" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that"
L469534	u2550	m165	MANK	No, you gotta hear this-
L469533	u2557	m165	WELLES	Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
L469532	u2550	m165	MANK	Hey, kid. Gregg.
L469377	u2557	m165	WELLES	He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
L469376	u2550	m165	MANK	I don't give a shit about-
L469375	u2557	m165	WELLES	Did I ever tell you about my father?
L469371	u2550	m165	MANK	I don't care.
L469370	u2557	m165	WELLES	I'm sorry.
L469369	u2550	m165	MANK	Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
L469368	u2557	m165	WELLES	I want you back
L469367	u2557	m165	WELLES	I just can't . . see it anymore
L469366	u2550	m165	MANK	Uh huh.
L469365	u2557	m165	WELLES	And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
L469285	u2550	m165	MANK	YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
L469284	u2557	m165	WELLES	Jesus Christ --
L469280	u2557	m165	WELLES	To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
L469279	u2550	m165	MANK	I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
L469278	u2557	m165	WELLES	But it's not a great syllable
L469277	u2550	m165	MANK	Craig is one syllable
L469276	u2557	m165	WELLES	K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
L469275	u2550	m165	MANK	Cain -- like the Bible guy?
L469274	u2557	m165	WELLES	"No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about ""Kane"" -- you like that?"
L469273	u2550	m165	MANK	The title?
L469272	u2557	m165	WELLES	Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
L469271	u2550	m165	MANK	What?
L469270	u2557	m165	WELLES	Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
L469269	u2550	m165	MANK	It's good, huh?
L469266	u2557	m165	WELLES	It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
L469265	u2550	m165	MANK	Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
L469264	u2557	m165	WELLES	It's 350 pages long.
L469231	u2550	m165	MANK	And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
L469230	u2557	m165	WELLES	The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
L469229	u2550	m165	MANK	And what does he see?
L469228	u2557	m165	WELLES	Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
L469227	u2557	m165	WELLES	He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
L469226	u2550	m165	MANK	They don't have to.
L469225	u2557	m165	WELLES	All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
L469220	u2550	m165	MANK	She was . . . innocent
L469219	u2557	m165	WELLES	Why her?
L469218	u2550	m165	MANK	This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
L469217	u2557	m165	WELLES	The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
L469215	u2550	m165	MANK	Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
L469214	u2557	m165	WELLES	How?
L469213	u2550	m165	MANK	Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
L469212	u2557	m165	WELLES	So, who is he? We have to know him.
L469209	u2557	m165	WELLES	Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
L469208	u2550	m165	MANK	He'll destroy us.
L469206	u2557	m165	WELLES	NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS
L469205	u2550	m165	MANK	I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
L469204	u2557	m165	WELLES	I'll hire you  -- right now-
L469203	u2550	m165	MANK	And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
L469202	u2557	m165	WELLES	It doesn't have to be
L469201	u2550	m165	MANK	When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
L469200	u2550	m165	MANK	I don't have it anymore?!
L469199	u2557	m165	WELLES	I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
L469198	u2550	m165	MANK	Fuck you--
L469197	u2557	m165	WELLES	Listen to me-
L469196	u2550	m165	MANK	Let me out.
L469194	u2557	m165	WELLES	--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
L469193	u2550	m165	MANK	Don't do this
L469192	u2557	m165	WELLES	Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
L469191	u2550	m165	MANK	Don't do this
L469190	u2557	m165	WELLES	I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
L469188	u2557	m165	WELLES	How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
L469187	u2550	m165	MANK	Sorry to disappoint.
L469186	u2557	m165	WELLES	I expected more from you.
L469185	u2550	m165	MANK	Fuck you
L469184	u2557	m165	WELLES	So speaks the court jester.
L469183	u2550	m165	MANK	You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
L469182	u2557	m165	WELLES	We're doing Hearst.
L469181	u2550	m165	MANK	Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
L469180	u2550	m165	MANK	Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
L469179	u2557	m165	WELLES	Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
L469178	u2550	m165	MANK	Orson. Stop. Just stop
L469177	u2557	m165	WELLES	How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
L469176	u2550	m165	MANK	Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
L469175	u2557	m165	WELLES	Mank-
L469174	u2550	m165	MANK	Please don't say this.
L469173	u2557	m165	WELLES	Yes.
L469172	u2550	m165	MANK	Oh Christ
L469171	u2557	m165	WELLES	Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
L469170	u2550	m165	MANK	Oh Christ...
L469169	u2557	m165	WELLES	Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
L469168	u2550	m165	MANK	This better be good
L469167	u2557	m165	WELLES	I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
L469166	u2550	m165	MANK	Oh for Christ's sake-
L469165	u2557	m165	WELLES	Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
L469164	u2550	m165	MANK	Okay, boy wonder, what?
L469163	u2557	m165	WELLES	Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
L469162	u2550	m165	MANK	Orson, please ... it's too bright
L469161	u2557	m165	WELLES	Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
L469135	u2550	m165	MANK	Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
L469134	u2557	m165	WELLES	Jesus
L469133	u2550	m165	MANK	The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
L469132	u2557	m165	WELLES	In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . How big is it, all told? The estate?
L469116	u2550	m165	MANK	No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
L469115	u2557	m165	WELLES	Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
L469113	u2557	m165	WELLES	He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
L469112	u2550	m165	MANK	The old man has his own way of doing things
L469111	u2557	m165	WELLES	The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
L469082	u2557	m165	WELLES	No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
L469081	u2550	m165	MANK	I don't wanna write about no spic.
L469080	u2557	m165	WELLES	The great Spanish bullfighter
L469079	u2550	m165	MANK	Who the hell's Manolete?
L469078	u2557	m165	WELLES	Manolete?!
L469077	u2550	m165	MANK	Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
L469076	u2557	m165	WELLES	Sigmund Freud?
L469070	u2550	m165	MANK	Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
L469069	u2557	m165	WELLES	Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
L469068	u2550	m165	MANK	I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
L469067	u2557	m165	WELLES	How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
L469065	u2550	m165	MANK	Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
L469064	u2557	m165	WELLES	But with compassion and insight--
L469063	u2550	m165	MANK	Like a bug.
L469062	u2557	m165	WELLES	We find the man and then we dissect him-
L469061	u2550	m165	MANK	Right-
L469060	u2557	m165	WELLES	So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
L469058	u2550	m165	MANK	You're a laugh-riot, kid.
L469057	u2557	m165	WELLES	That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
L469056	u2550	m165	MANK	Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
L469055	u2557	m165	WELLES	Not for me.
L469054	u2550	m165	MANK	Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
L469053	u2557	m165	WELLES	Magic
L469052	u2550	m165	MANK	Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
L469051	u2557	m165	WELLES	Showing life
L469050	u2550	m165	MANK	Nope.
L469049	u2557	m165	WELLES	Telling stories.
L469048	u2550	m165	MANK	What are movies about?
L469047	u2557	m165	WELLES	Forget it-
L469046	u2550	m165	MANK	What are movies about, Orson?
L469045	u2557	m165	WELLES	Nonsense
L469044	u2550	m165	MANK	But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
L469043	u2557	m165	WELLES	All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
L469042	u2550	m165	MANK	I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
L469822	u2550	m165	MANK	So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
L469821	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Herman.
L469820	u2550	m165	MANK	Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
L469791	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
L469790	u2550	m165	MANK	Oh God.
L469789	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	And they went to the stockholders in New York.
L469788	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
L469738	u2550	m165	MANK	Yeah, ain't it swell?
L469737	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
L469666	u2555	m165	SHOP OWNER	Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
L469665	u2551	m165	MARION	As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
L469664	u2555	m165	SHOP OWNER	Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
L469663	u2551	m165	MARION	Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
L469662	u2555	m165	SHOP OWNER	Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
L469661	u2551	m165	MARION	Thank you-
L469660	u2555	m165	SHOP OWNER	Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
L469659	u2551	m165	MARION	Yes.
L469658	u2555	m165	SHOP OWNER	Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
L469657	u2551	m165	MARION	I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
L469656	u2555	m165	SHOP OWNER	May I help you?
L469767	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Get out.
L469766	u2552	m165	MAYER	You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
L469765	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Get out
L469764	u2552	m165	MAYER	Yes
L469763	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
L469762	u2552	m165	MAYER	Yes
L469761	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	You talked to New York?
L469760	u2552	m165	MAYER	We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
L469759	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	You're lying to me.
L469758	u2552	m165	MAYER	No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
L469757	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	You're going to destroy it
L469756	u2552	m165	MAYER	That's for me to decide.
L469755	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	To do what?
L469754	u2552	m165	MAYER	And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
L469753	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Very generous
L469752	u2552	m165	MAYER	800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
L469751	u2552	m165	MAYER	It came.
L469341	u2557	m165	WELLES	Again
L469340	u2553	m165	PAUL STEWART	"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
L469339	u2557	m165	WELLES	Again
L469338	u2553	m165	PAUL STEWART	Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."""
L469332	u2557	m165	WELLES	Again
L469331	u2553	m165	PAUL STEWART	"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
L469330	u2557	m165	WELLES	Again.
L469329	u2553	m165	PAUL STEWART	Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
L469328	u2557	m165	WELLES	Again.
L469327	u2553	m165	PAUL STEWART	"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
L469833	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
L469832	u2557	m165	WELLES	So, on to the Life Of Christ!
L469831	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	It was the best, kid
L469830	u2557	m165	WELLES	It was fun, wasn't it?
L469829	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
L469828	u2557	m165	WELLES	Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
L469827	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Oh God. . .
L469819	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Happy birthday.
L469818	u2557	m165	WELLES	It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
L469786	u2557	m165	WELLES	I don't want to sit
L469785	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	I think you better sit down
L469784	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
L469783	u2557	m165	WELLES	I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
L469782	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
L469781	u2557	m165	WELLES	Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
L469780	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	No, we're jake. But listen-
L469779	u2557	m165	WELLES	You're not still mad at me, I hope
L469748	u2557	m165	WELLES	It was a -joke, George
L469747	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
L469746	u2557	m165	WELLES	I really think you're
L469745	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
L469684	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
L469683	u2557	m165	WELLES	That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
L469682	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
L469681	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Your movie"" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!"
L469680	u2557	m165	WELLES	It's just that my movie is so-
L469679	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
L469678	u2557	m165	WELLES	Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
L469677	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	For Christ's sake, shut up--
L469676	u2557	m165	WELLES	You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
L469675	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Well it' s all you've got !
L469674	u2557	m165	WELLES	Do what you can?! That's not good enough I
L469673	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
L469672	u2557	m165	WELLES	Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
L469671	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
L469670	u2557	m165	WELLES	Then find another theater
L469669	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
L469473	u2557	m165	WELLES	The ad..
L469472	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
L469425	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	"When Hedda says ""I'm coming"" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray."
L469424	u2557	m165	WELLES	The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
L469423	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	They've all seen a rough cut
L469422	u2557	m165	WELLES	This is an abomination There's no music and--
L469318	u2557	m165	WELLES	Ah, it's a grand title.
L469317	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	For the title
L469312	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
L469311	u2557	m165	WELLES	Please don't ask me to do this.
L469310	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
L469309	u2557	m165	WELLES	Jesus
L469308	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
L469307	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
L469306	u2557	m165	WELLES	I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
L469305	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
L469304	u2557	m165	WELLES	"A ""Z"" and a ""K"" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a ""Z"" and a ""P"" and that worked--"
L469303	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
L469302	u2557	m165	WELLES	Pardon?
L469301	u2554	m165	SCHAEFER	CITIZEN KANE
L469300	u2557	m165	WELLES	It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
L469531	u2557	m165	WELLES	Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
L469530	u2556	m165	TOLAND	You want to do the life of Jesus?
L469529	u2557	m165	WELLES	I'm Christ
L469528	u2556	m165	TOLAND	He's Christ?
L469527	u2557	m165	WELLES	Yes!
L469526	u2556	m165	TOLAND	Oh, no--
L469417	u2557	m165	WELLES	Yeah.
L469416	u2556	m165	TOLAND	We done?
L469415	u2557	m165	WELLES	How 'bout a real drink?
L469397	u2556	m165	TOLAND	Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
L469396	u2557	m165	WELLES	Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
L469395	u2556	m165	TOLAND	I know what you want but it can't be done!
L469394	u2557	m165	WELLES	I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
L469393	u2556	m165	TOLAND	Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
L469392	u2557	m165	WELLES	It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
L469359	u2557	m165	WELLES	Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
L469358	u2556	m165	TOLAND	Orson, you wanna take five?
L458974	u2563	m166	JAKE	For what?
L458973	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
L458972	u2563	m166	JAKE	About what?
L458971	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	They wanna talk to you.
L458970	u2563	m166	JAKE	I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
L458969	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	We're from...
L458968	u2563	m166	JAKE	Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
L458967	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	Let's go, Jake, wake up!
L458750	u2559	m166	COMO	Ok, champ.
L458749	u2563	m166	JAKE	No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
L458748	u2559	m166	COMO	Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
L458747	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm Ok.
L458746	u2559	m166	COMO	You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
L458745	u2563	m166	JAKE	Tommy, thanks for coming over.
L458744	u2559	m166	COMO	Hey champ!
L458683	u2559	m166	COMO	Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
L458682	u2564	m166	JOEY	Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
L458681	u2559	m166	COMO	He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
L458680	u2564	m166	JOEY	How can he embarrass you?
L458679	u2559	m166	COMO	Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
L458678	u2564	m166	JOEY	Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
L458677	u2559	m166	COMO	What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
L458676	u2564	m166	JOEY	Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
L458675	u2559	m166	COMO	Aside from everything else, your family all right?
L458673	u2559	m166	COMO	All right, you guys, shake hands.
L458672	u2564	m166	JOEY	Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
L458671	u2559	m166	COMO	All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
L458710	u2563	m166	JAKE	You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
L458709	u2560	m166	EAGAN	What?
L458708	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
L458707	u2560	m166	EAGAN	I want to believe you, LaMotta.
L458706	u2563	m166	JAKE	Believe what you want.
L458705	u2560	m166	EAGAN	Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
L458704	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
L458703	u2560	m166	EAGAN	You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
L458702	u2563	m166	JAKE	What who's been sayin'?
L458699	u2560	m166	EAGAN	I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
L458698	u2563	m166	JAKE	What's up, Colonel?
L458447	u2561	m166	IRMA	None of your fuckin' business.
L458446	u2563	m166	JAKE	And where you goin'?
L458445	u2561	m166	IRMA	You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
L458444	u2563	m166	JAKE	What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
L458443	u2561	m166	IRMA	Where you going at this hour?
L458361	u2563	m166	JAKE	No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
L458360	u2561	m166	IRMA	Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
L458359	u2561	m166	IRMA	Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
L458358	u2563	m166	JAKE	It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
L458357	u2561	m166	IRMA	It's not done.
L458356	u2563	m166	JAKE	This looks done.
L458948	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
L458947	u2562	m166	J.R.	Where's your wife, Jake?
L458946	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
L458945	u2562	m166	J.R.	I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
L458944	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're a good sport, lady.
L458942	u2562	m166	J.R.	You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
L458941	u2563	m166	JAKE	J.R., glad you could make it.
L458872	u2564	m166	JOEY	Stop it. What're you, crazy?
L458871	u2563	m166	JAKE	Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
L458840	u2564	m166	JOEY	I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
L458839	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
L458838	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whatsa matter with you?
L458837	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did you ever fuck my wife?
L458836	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whadda ya mean?
L458835	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
L458834	u2564	m166	JOEY	What?
L458833	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did you ever fuck my wife?
L458832	u2564	m166	JOEY	You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
L458831	u2563	m166	JAKE	Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
L458830	u2564	m166	JOEY	So what?
L458829	u2563	m166	JAKE	"But you said ""you."""
L458828	u2564	m166	JOEY	I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
L458827	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do you mean, ""you""?"
L458826	u2564	m166	JOEY	What?
L458825	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do you mean, ""you""?"
L458824	u2564	m166	JOEY	So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
L458823	u2563	m166	JAKE	You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
L458822	u2564	m166	JOEY	"Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin"" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now."
L458821	u2563	m166	JAKE	When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
L458820	u2564	m166	JOEY	What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
L458819	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
L458818	u2564	m166	JOEY	Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
L458817	u2563	m166	JAKE	Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
L458816	u2564	m166	JOEY	I did keep an eye...
L458815	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
L458814	u2564	m166	JOEY	What?
L458813	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
L458812	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whatever you touched, that's good now.
L458810	u2563	m166	JAKE	Well, I heard some things.
L458809	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
L458808	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
L458807	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, I just told you what happened.
L458806	u2563	m166	JAKE	Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
L458805	u2564	m166	JOEY	It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
L458804	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why didn't you tell me about it?
L458803	u2564	m166	JOEY	Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
L458802	u2563	m166	JAKE	You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
L458801	u2564	m166	JOEY	When?
L458800	u2563	m166	JAKE	Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
L458798	u2564	m166	JOEY	I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
L458797	u2563	m166	JAKE	How's that?
L458796	u2563	m166	JAKE	Well, that's what I mean.
L458795	u2564	m166	JOEY	Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
L458794	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
L458793	u2564	m166	JOEY	What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
L458790	u2563	m166	JAKE	Where you been?
L458789	u2564	m166	JOEY	Screw you, Jack.
L458738	u2563	m166	JAKE	What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
L458737	u2564	m166	JOEY	So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
L458736	u2563	m166	JAKE	I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
L458735	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
L458731	u2564	m166	JOEY	We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
L458730	u2563	m166	JAKE	Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
L458729	u2564	m166	JOEY	All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
L458728	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
L458727	u2564	m166	JOEY	Except fall down like a normal person.
L458726	u2563	m166	JAKE	What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
L458725	u2564	m166	JOEY	See? That's all there was to it.
L458724	u2564	m166	JOEY	G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
L458723	u2563	m166	JAKE	C'mon, Joey.
L458722	u2564	m166	JOEY	Stick out your hands, Jake.
L458695	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, I know.
L458694	u2564	m166	JOEY	I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
L458693	u2563	m166	JAKE	What did Tommy say?
L458692	u2564	m166	JOEY	Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
L458691	u2563	m166	JAKE	I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
L458690	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
L458689	u2563	m166	JAKE	When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
L458688	u2564	m166	JOEY	Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
L458687	u2563	m166	JAKE	What do you mean?
L458686	u2564	m166	JOEY	Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
L458685	u2563	m166	JAKE	I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
L458684	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whatcha doin'?
L458587	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
L458586	u2564	m166	JOEY	Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
L458583	u2564	m166	JOEY	C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
L458582	u2563	m166	JAKE	Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
L458581	u2564	m166	JOEY	Nah, she would never...
L458556	u2564	m166	JOEY	This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
L458555	u2563	m166	JAKE	Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
L458554	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want the title shot or not?
L458553	u2563	m166	JAKE	Say what you're gonna say.
L458552	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want the title shot?
L458551	u2563	m166	JAKE	Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
L458550	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
L458549	u2563	m166	JAKE	I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
L458548	u2563	m166	JAKE	No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
L458547	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want us to wait for you?
L458543	u2563	m166	JAKE	I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
L458542	u2564	m166	JOEY	You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
L458541	u2563	m166	JAKE	Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
L458540	u2564	m166	JOEY	They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
L458520	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
L458519	u2564	m166	JOEY	He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
L458462	u2564	m166	JOEY	Give me a chance. Let me look.
L458461	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do you see her yet?
L458454	u2563	m166	JAKE	How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
L458453	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
L458452	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
L458442	u2564	m166	JOEY	C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
L458441	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
L458440	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
L458439	u2563	m166	JAKE	Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
L458438	u2564	m166	JOEY	Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
L458437	u2563	m166	JAKE	You know, like bang her or anything?
L458436	u2564	m166	JOEY	With her? How?
L458435	u2563	m166	JAKE	You wasn't with her?
L458434	u2564	m166	JOEY	Huh?
L458433	u2563	m166	JAKE	You wasn't with her, were you?
L458432	u2564	m166	JOEY	Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
L458431	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, she's nice.
L458430	u2564	m166	JOEY	Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
L458429	u2563	m166	JAKE	What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
L458428	u2564	m166	JOEY	Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
L458427	u2563	m166	JAKE	She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
L458426	u2564	m166	JOEY	How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
L458425	u2563	m166	JAKE	'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
L458424	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
L458423	u2563	m166	JAKE	Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
L458422	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
L458421	u2563	m166	JAKE	How do you know? You know her that good?
L458420	u2564	m166	JOEY	You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
L458419	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go 'head.
L458418	u2564	m166	JOEY	Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
L458417	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah --
L458416	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
L458415	u2563	m166	JAKE	Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
L458414	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whadda you care?
L458413	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who's that?
L458409	u2564	m166	JOEY	I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
L458408	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
L458407	u2564	m166	JOEY	What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
L458406	u2563	m166	JAKE	And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
L458403	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
L458402	u2564	m166	JOEY	Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
L458401	u2563	m166	JAKE	Answer me when I talk to you.
L458397	u2563	m166	JAKE	See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
L458396	u2564	m166	JOEY	What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
L458395	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go ahead.
L458394	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack! Enough!
L458393	u2563	m166	JAKE	Harder.  Take the towel off.
L458389	u2563	m166	JAKE	Here's your glove.
L458388	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack, I got no gloves.
L458387	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
L458386	u2564	m166	JOEY	C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
L458385	u2563	m166	JAKE	You heard me, I said hit me.
L458384	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want me to do what?
L458383	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hit me in the face.
L458382	u2564	m166	JOEY	Sure. What is it?
L458381	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah. Do me a favor.
L458380	u2564	m166	JOEY	You know?
L458379	u2563	m166	JAKE	I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
L458378	u2564	m166	JOEY	That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
L458376	u2564	m166	JOEY	What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
L458375	u2563	m166	JAKE	I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
L458374	u2564	m166	JOEY	Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
L458373	u2563	m166	JAKE	Nothing...
L458372	u2564	m166	JOEY	What's wrong?
L458937	u2565	m166	REPORTER	What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
L458936	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
L458935	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
L458934	u2565	m166	REPORTER	You sound bitter.
L458933	u2563	m166	JAKE	It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
L458932	u2565	m166	REPORTER	Does that mean...
L458931	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
L458522	u2563	m166	JAKE	I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
L458521	u2565	m166	REPORTER	You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
L458518	u2563	m166	JAKE	You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
L458517	u2565	m166	REPORTER	Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
L458516	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
L458513	u2563	m166	JAKE	Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
L458512	u2565	m166	REPORTER	Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
L458511	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
L458925	u2568	m166	TONY	Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
L458924	u2563	m166	JAKE	He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
L458893	u2563	m166	JAKE	Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
L458892	u2568	m166	TONY	I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
L458891	u2563	m166	JAKE	Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
L458890	u2568	m166	TONY	Three more, I figure.
L458889	u2563	m166	JAKE	How many pounds I gotta lose?
L458888	u2568	m166	TONY	Yeah. At night.
L458887	u2563	m166	JAKE	At night?
L458886	u2568	m166	TONY	Nine o'clock.
L458885	u2563	m166	JAKE	What time is it?
L458884	u2568	m166	TONY	It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
L458717	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
L458716	u2568	m166	TONY	Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
L458996	u2563	m166	JAKE	What friends?
L458995	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Can't you get the money from your friends?
L458994	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't make no difference no more.
L458993	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
L458992	u2563	m166	JAKE	"Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? ""LaMotta on Vice Rap."" Everybody likes a shot at the Champ."
L458991	u2569	m166	VICKIE	But they don't have a case against you.
L458990	u2563	m166	JAKE	I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
L458989	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What are you doing?
L458988	u2569	m166	VICKIE	All right, just don't make any noise.
L458987	u2563	m166	JAKE	I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
L458986	u2569	m166	VICKIE	The kids are sleeping.
L458984	u2563	m166	JAKE	No. Open the door.
L458983	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Are you drunk?
L458982	u2563	m166	JAKE	Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
L458965	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
L458964	u2563	m166	JAKE	Aw, c'mon, Vick --
L458963	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
L458962	u2563	m166	JAKE	Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
L458961	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
L458960	u2563	m166	JAKE	Open the door, Vickie.
L458959	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
L458958	u2563	m166	JAKE	Sure, what else is new?
L458957	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm leaving you Jake.
L458956	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
L458912	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
L458911	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
L458910	u2563	m166	JAKE	I dunno.
L458909	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Why don't you just call him?
L458908	u2563	m166	JAKE	I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
L458904	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I don't know.
L458903	u2563	m166	JAKE	Then what?
L458902	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No, not that.
L458901	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, ""Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?"" Is that what I say?"
L458900	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Why don't you just call him up?
L458899	u2563	m166	JAKE	OK. Talk.
L458898	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
L458897	u2563	m166	JAKE	What?
L458896	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake --
L458895	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
L458894	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
L458883	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah --
L458882	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
L458878	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
L458877	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
L458876	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
L458875	u2563	m166	JAKE	Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
L458874	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
L458868	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Yeah, I sucked his cock.
L458867	u2563	m166	JAKE	You did?
L458866	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
L458863	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're a fuckin' liar.
L458862	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
L458861	u2563	m166	JAKE	Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
L458860	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
L458859	u2563	m166	JAKE	With Salvy, eh?
L458858	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
L458857	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
L458856	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, no --
L458855	u2563	m166	JAKE	What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
L458854	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I am answering...
L458853	u2563	m166	JAKE	Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
L458852	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What're you talking about?
L458851	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
L458850	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
L458849	u2563	m166	JAKE	What was it about?
L458848	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Father of the Bride.
L458847	u2563	m166	JAKE	What'd you see?
L458846	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I went to the movies.
L458845	u2563	m166	JAKE	What'd you see?
L458844	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I got bored so I went to the movies.
L458843	u2563	m166	JAKE	I called. You weren't there.
L458842	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I took the kids to my sister's.
L458841	u2563	m166	JAKE	Where you been all day?
L458792	u2563	m166	JAKE	What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
L458791	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I went out.
L458788	u2563	m166	JAKE	Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
L458787	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What's the matter with you?
L458763	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake...
L458762	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
L458761	u2569	m166	VICKIE	But Jake... I didn't say anything...
L458759	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You're hurting my arm.
L458758	u2563	m166	JAKE	You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
L458757	u2569	m166	VICKIE	All I did...
L458756	u2563	m166	JAKE	You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
L458755	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What did I do?
L458754	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
L458617	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
L458616	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Positive.
L458615	u2563	m166	JAKE	You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
L458614	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I never noticed his face.
L458613	u2563	m166	JAKE	That he's got a pretty face.
L458612	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What did I say?
L458611	u2563	m166	JAKE	Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
L458610	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Nobody. I love you, remember?
L458609	u2563	m166	JAKE	Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
L458608	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Yeah, what?
L458607	u2563	m166	JAKE	Huh?
L458606	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Yeah.
L458605	u2563	m166	JAKE	You asleep?
L458604	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What?
L458603	u2563	m166	JAKE	Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
L458580	u2563	m166	JAKE	Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
L458579	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
L458578	u2563	m166	JAKE	In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
L458577	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No, I'm not.
L458576	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're not interested in him?
L458575	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm not interested in him.
L458574	u2563	m166	JAKE	"Don't tell me ""No."" I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?"
L458573	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
L458572	u2563	m166	JAKE	What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
L458564	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who asked you?
L458563	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I was just...
L458562	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who asked you?
L458561	u2569	m166	VICKIE	But, Jake, I was just...
L458560	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who asked you?
L458559	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
L458558	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do you mean, ""good looking?"""
L458557	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
L458538	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Oh, Jake.
L458537	u2563	m166	JAKE	Now, touch me...  ...here.
L458536	u2563	m166	JAKE	Now take your panties off.
L458535	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I like the gym smell.
L458534	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go 'head. Do it.
L458533	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
L458532	u2563	m166	JAKE	Now take the rest off.
L458531	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do what I say.
L458530	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake...
L458529	u2563	m166	JAKE	Take off my pants.
L458528	u2563	m166	JAKE	Come here.
L458527	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
L458526	u2563	m166	JAKE	If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
L458525	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You said never to touch you before a fight.
L458524	u2563	m166	JAKE	Come over here.
L458523	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Are you sure we should be doing this?
L458505	u2563	m166	JAKE	It's OK.
L458504	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake...
L458503	u2563	m166	JAKE	That's all right. He don't mind.
L458502	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
L458492	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What does that mean?
L458491	u2563	m166	JAKE	No.
L458490	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Can you see it?
L458488	u2563	m166	JAKE	Can you see it?
L458487	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I can't find my ball.
L458486	u2563	m166	JAKE	Just give it a nice little tap.
L458485	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Should I hit it?
L458484	u2563	m166	JAKE	Just keep your eye on the ball.
L458483	u2569	m166	VICKIE	It feels real good.
L458482	u2563	m166	JAKE	That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
L458481	u2563	m166	JAKE	You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
L458480	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
L458477	u2563	m166	JAKE	Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
L458476	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
L458475	u2563	m166	JAKE	I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
L458474	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You don't talk very much.
L458471	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
L458470	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
L458469	u2563	m166	JAKE	You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
L458468	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I just wanted to say hello.
L458467	u2563	m166	JAKE	Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
L458602	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
L458601	u2567	m166	TOMMY	All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
L458600	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, the weight's Ok.
L458599	u2567	m166	TOMMY	How's the weight? Ok?
L458597	u2567	m166	TOMMY	This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
L458596	u2563	m166	JAKE	He should.
L458595	u2567	m166	TOMMY	Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
L458594	u2563	m166	JAKE	Never felt better.
L458593	u2567	m166	TOMMY	How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
L458592	u2563	m166	JAKE	C'mon, Tommy --
L458591	u2567	m166	TOMMY	"Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them ""moulan yans"" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you."
L458590	u2567	m166	TOMMY	Jake, sit down for a minute.
L458589	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hi, Tommy. How are you?
L458667	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
L458666	u2566	m166	SALVY	Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
L458662	u2566	m166	SALVY	Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
L458661	u2564	m166	JOEY	What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
L458660	u2566	m166	SALVY	Excuse me for living.
L458659	u2564	m166	JOEY	Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
L458658	u2566	m166	SALVY	Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
L458657	u2564	m166	JOEY	I said, let's go.
L458368	u2564	m166	JOEY	Right, the gym.
L458367	u2566	m166	SALVY	Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
L458366	u2564	m166	JOEY	All right, I'll try. See you later.
L458365	u2566	m166	SALVY	Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
L458364	u2566	m166	SALVY	Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
L458363	u2564	m166	JOEY	I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
L458350	u2566	m166	SALVY	"Get lost.  Hey kids, ""A cop is a rat."" Remember that, ""A rat."""
L458349	u2564	m166	JOEY	Hey, leave the kids alone.
L458348	u2566	m166	SALVY	He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
L458347	u2564	m166	JOEY	What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
L458346	u2566	m166	SALVY	Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
L458345	u2564	m166	JOEY	Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
L458655	u2569	m166	VICKIE	And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
L458654	u2564	m166	JOEY	And you're drinking with them right now.
L458653	u2569	m166	VICKIE	That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
L458652	u2564	m166	JOEY	Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
L458651	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
L458650	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
L458649	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
L458648	u2564	m166	JOEY	It don't look right.
L458647	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
L458646	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, you're his wife.
L458645	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
L458644	u2564	m166	JOEY	What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
L68638	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
L68637	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
L68636	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
L68635	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What about the shit they write?
L68634	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
L68633	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	The whole thing ? painting.
L68632	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	Of what?
L68631	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Do you ever get sick of it?
L68630	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
L68626	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
L68625	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	Let's get out of here.
L68624	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Naa..
L68515	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
L68514	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Why, so you could humiliate me?
L68513	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
L68512	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
L68511	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
L68510	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What do you think?
L68266	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
L68265	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Not sure. How was yours?
L68264	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	When's your show?
L68263	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I don't know.
L68262	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	Is this finished yet?
L68261	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	Rene's been telling me about your work.
L68260	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Hey ? it's the big A.M..
L68053	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	Really. Huh. Too bad.
L68052	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'm a painter, too.
L68051	u3887	m258	ALBERT MILO	No. Should I have?
L68050	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
L68390	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Oh, I didn't know that.
L68389	u3902	m258	JACK MILO	It's in New York.
L68388	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	I think it's in New Jersey.
L68387	u3902	m258	JACK MILO	New York.
L68386	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	It's in New Jersey.
L68385	u3902	m258	JACK MILO	Saddle River, New York!
L68384	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Saddle River's in New Jersey.
L68383	u3902	m258	JACK MILO	Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
L68538	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
L68537	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
L68532	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
L68531	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
L68530	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
L68529	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
L68528	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	"I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says ""Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."""
L68526	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	We can do better. It needed more white.
L68525	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	That was my favorite part!
L68523	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	I don't like beer.
L68522	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
L68521	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
L68520	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Piss painting?
L68519	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
L68518	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
L68517	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What's with the wigs?
L68477	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Well, have you asked her to come back?
L68476	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
L68475	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Do you still love her?
L68474	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
L68473	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	What's wrong?
L68472	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Ouch..
L68471	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
L68470	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
L68469	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
L68468	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Cool.
L68467	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
L68466	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah ? I'd do that... You could teach me.
L68465	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
L68464	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	"Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors ? anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: ""Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"""
L68463	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	That's good. At least they're interested.
L68462	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
L68324	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah, I met her already.
L68323	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
L68322	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
L68321	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
L68092	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You don't even work on your stuff!
L68091	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
L68090	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Ten bucks apiece.
L68089	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
L68088	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah... Like ? stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
L68087	u3888	m258	ANDY WARHOL	Ignorant art?
L68086	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
L68222	u3899	m258	GINA	I really think you should talk to him about this.
L68221	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
L68219	u3899	m258	GINA	You should talk to him about this.
L68218	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	How much for these five?
L68217	u3899	m258	GINA	Aren't they?
L68216	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	These are great.
L68214	u3899	m258	GINA	No.
L68213	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	Is Jean Michel here?
L68211	u3899	m258	GINA	Who?
L68210	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	Annina Nosei.
L68209	u3899	m258	GINA	Who is it?
L68408	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Sure.
L68407	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
L68328	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
L68327	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	Jean, your parents are here.
L68273	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I know.
L68272	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
L68224	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	How about right now?
L68223	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	When?
L68192	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You want a drink?
L68191	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
L68190	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You name it, I paint there.
L68189	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
L68184	u3889	m258	ANNINA NOSEI	You haven't been by lately.
L68183	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	No.
L68161	u3906	m258	RENE	I know that. Don't let him get away.
L68160	u3890	m258	ARTIST #2	That's the same guy who did this painting.
L68159	u3906	m258	RENE	MOTHAFUCKAH!
L68157	u3906	m258	RENE	Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
L68156	u3890	m258	ARTIST #2	How do you know?
L68155	u3906	m258	RENE	Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
L68150	u3890	m258	ARTIST #2	I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
L68149	u3906	m258	RENE	Who did this?  Who did this?
L68144	u3890	m258	ARTIST #2	Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
L68143	u3906	m258	RENE	Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
L68142	u3890	m258	ARTIST #2	Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
L68654	u3894	m258	BRUNO	You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
L68653	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What do you mean?
L68652	u3894	m258	BRUNO	I didn't see you.
L68651	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	B.B. It's me ? Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
L68361	u3894	m258	BRUNO	It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
L68360	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
L68359	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Sure, ok..
L68358	u3894	m258	BRUNO	You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
L68094	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I can get ten.
L68093	u3894	m258	BRUNO	It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
L68629	u3904	m258	MARY BOONE	OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
L68628	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'm here.
L68627	u3904	m258	MARY BOONE	Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
L68618	u3904	m258	MARY BOONE	You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
L68617	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I need a dealer.
L68616	u3904	m258	MARY BOONE	Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
L68393	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
L68392	u3904	m258	MARY BOONE	I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
L68451	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
L68450	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Should there be?
L68449	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
L68448	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
L68447	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
L68445	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
L68444	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
L68443	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Why, that's from Time Magazine.
L68442	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Who said that?
L68441	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	"I see..  And... How do you respond to being called ? hmmm...  ? yes, ""the pickaninny of the art world."""
L68440	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	We don't hang them at home, y'know ? just in the streets..
L68439	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
L68438	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yup.
L68437	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
L68436	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
L68435	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Not black.
L68434	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Not what?
L68433	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	You're not?
L68432	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'm not black.
L68431	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	What?
L68430	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I use a lot of colors ? not only black.
L68429	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Yes, but as a black painter ?
L68428	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	"Oh, that's a ""Leonardo's Greatest Hits"" painting. You like it?"
L68427	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
L68426	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	A primate?
L68425	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You mean like an ape?
L68424	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
L68423	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
L68422	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	What are they?
L68421	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
L68420	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Yes, I understand ? but where do you take them from?
L68419	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	They're just words.
L68418	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	Yes. What do they... stand for?
L68417	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Decipher?
L68416	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	... Can you... decipher this for us?
L68413	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I hate this. Turn that off.
L68412	u3901	m258	INTERVIEWER	What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
L68500	u3898	m258	GEORGE	Very well.
L68499	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah.
L68498	u3898	m258	GEORGE	Really?
L68497	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
L68495	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
L68494	u3898	m258	GEORGE	I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
L68485	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Chateau Latour '64, please.
L68484	u3898	m258	GEORGE	Would you like to see the wine list?
L68609	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What's wrong with you today?
L68608	u3907	m258	SHENGE	Blue? Where?
L68600	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
L68599	u3907	m258	SHENGE	Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
L68598	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Why don't you try letting her in, Steve ? I mean Shenge.
L68597	u3907	m258	SHENGE	It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
L68595	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Use your fucking instinct.
L68594	u3907	m258	SHENGE	You want me to put it here?
L68593	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah..
L68592	u3907	m258	SHENGE	? In this corner?
L68591	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Still not here.
L68590	u3907	m258	SHENGE	It's Andy again.
L68589	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
L68588	u3907	m258	SHENGE	Out?
L68587	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Paint it out.
L68672	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
L68671	u3892	m258	BENNY	Drugs??!
L68670	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
L68669	u3892	m258	BENNY	Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
L68668	u3892	m258	BENNY	Come on, let's get out of here.
L68667	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I guess it was a long time ago.
L68666	u3892	m258	BENNY	She's good.
L68237	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
L68236	u3892	m258	BENNY	That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
L68235	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
L68234	u3892	m258	BENNY	What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
L68233	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Good. What do you have?
L68232	u3892	m258	BENNY	I don't really have any problems.
L68231	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
L68230	u3892	m258	BENNY	Good.
L68229	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I ain't John Henry.
L68228	u3892	m258	BENNY	What's the rush, John Henry?
L68136	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah... I'll paint on it.
L68135	u3892	m258	BENNY	You gonna carry that around all night?
L68134	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	For real?
L68133	u3892	m258	BENNY	We got beat.
L68113	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Come on in!
L68112	u3892	m258	BENNY	Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
L68100	u3892	m258	BENNY	Hi Gina.
L68099	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Check you later, man.
L68081	u3892	m258	BENNY	Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
L68080	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
L68079	u3892	m258	BENNY	What're you doing? You're doing something.
L68075	u3892	m258	BENNY	He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
L68074	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	So then what?
L68073	u3892	m258	BENNY	"Oh man! Folklore guy ? worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says ""Fuck that, I'm a MAN"" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?"
L68072	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Who's John Henry?
L68071	u3892	m258	BENNY	Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry ? fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
L68066	u3892	m258	BENNY	Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
L68065	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
L68062	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Oh ? you mean black people!
L68061	u3892	m258	BENNY	Your people.
L68060	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	About what?
L68059	u3892	m258	BENNY	You're shattering all my myths.
L68058	u3892	m258	BENNY	Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
L68057	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I am... On Gina.  Fuck ? I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
L68056	u3892	m258	BENNY	Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
L67999	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist ? she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
L67998	u3892	m258	BENNY	You got a date already?
L67997	u3892	m258	BENNY	Thanks.  Your dad called again ? something about a job.
L67996	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here ? I made this for you.
L67995	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	"Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  ""Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me."" I did say chicken!"
L67994	u3892	m258	BENNY	Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
L67993	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me! Bring me some chicken, baby!
L67954	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Oh yeah..
L67953	u3892	m258	BENNY	SAMO.
L67952	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Who am I?
L67951	u3892	m258	BENNY	The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic ? writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
L67950	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Who's that?
L67946	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Willie Mays.
L67945	u3892	m258	BENNY	Hey ? Willie Mays.
L68508	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What's his name?
L68507	u3899	m258	GINA	You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
L68502	u3899	m258	GINA	I don't believe it, Jean ? they're picking straws.
L68501	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were ?
L68493	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	George?
L68492	u3899	m258	GINA	That is amazing. What year is it?
L68491	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Forget it.
L68490	u3899	m258	GINA	What's that about?
L68489	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're ?
L68488	u3899	m258	GINA	Pretty much the same.
L68487	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	How is he?
L68486	u3899	m258	GINA	So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but ? whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
L68483	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
L68482	u3899	m258	GINA	Don't you think he's using you?
L68481	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
L68480	u3899	m258	GINA	So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
L68312	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	A present I picked up for you.
L68311	u3899	m258	GINA	What's that?
L68310	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Hi.
L68309	u3899	m258	GINA	Hi.
L68208	u3899	m258	GINA	You're your own baby.
L68207	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What's wrong with me?
L68206	u3899	m258	GINA	You mean babies with you?
L68205	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	... babies.
L68204	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Think so?
L68203	u3899	m258	GINA	It looks done.
L68200	u3899	m258	GINA	Staten Island would be ok.
L68199	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee ?
L68198	u3899	m258	GINA	I hadn't thought about it.
L68197	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
L68180	u3899	m258	GINA	Well thanks!
L68179	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
L68132	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You want some?
L68131	u3899	m258	GINA	Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
L68129	u3899	m258	GINA	Basquiat, what did you take?
L68128	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'm your family.
L68127	u3899	m258	GINA	You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
L68126	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
L68125	u3899	m258	GINA	It's Monday morning.
L68124	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You're back.
L68123	u3899	m258	GINA	Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
L68122	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	... What's the matter?
L68110	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
L68109	u3899	m258	GINA	What who's saying?
L68108	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Do you know what he's saying?
L68107	u3899	m258	GINA	You don't have any fucking money..
L68106	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	... I'll buy you some new ones.
L68105	u3899	m258	GINA	I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
L68104	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
L68103	u3899	m258	GINA	Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
L68030	u3899	m258	GINA	A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
L68029	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Wanna go get some breakfast?
L68021	u3899	m258	GINA	I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
L68020	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I thought you hated this place?
L67986	u3899	m258	GINA	Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
L67985	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Party girls? Can I call you?
L67984	u3899	m258	GINA	I don't go there. Too many party girls.
L67983	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
L67982	u3899	m258	GINA	You do! You definitely do.
L67981	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
L67980	u3899	m258	GINA	Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
L67977	u3899	m258	GINA	I think I could do that alone.
L67976	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Can I walk you home?
L67975	u3899	m258	GINA	Guess I just got sick of him.
L67974	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I guess you did.
L67973	u3899	m258	GINA	No, don't tell me ? you just got fired by your crazy boss.
L68459	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar ? I'll get the rest.
L68458	u3896	m258	COUNTERMAN	It's three thousand dollars!
L68457	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'll take the whole tin.
L68456	u3896	m258	COUNTERMAN	Yeah, it's the best one.
L68455	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Is that the best quality you have?
L68297	u3896	m258	COUNTERMAN	You only want one Big Mac?
L68296	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
L68295	u3896	m258	COUNTERMAN	You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
L68294	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
L68379	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
L68378	u3897	m258	DRIVER	They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
L68377	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What's your name, man?
L68375	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Sure. I'd be glad to.
L68374	u3897	m258	DRIVER	Would you check out my studio some time?
L68373	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	That's great.
L68372	u3897	m258	DRIVER	You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
L68371	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Me? Why?
L68370	u3897	m258	DRIVER	I really... admire you.
L68648	u3908	m258	STELLA	Thanks
L68647	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	See you later.
L68646	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Stand still.
L68645	u3908	m258	STELLA	Some of them.
L68644	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You like your dad's paintings?
L68643	u3908	m258	STELLA	I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
L68642	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Hi.
L68641	u3908	m258	STELLA	Hi.
L68308	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
L68307	u3893	m258	BIG PINK	You're a fast mover.
L68306	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
L68305	u3893	m258	BIG PINK	I don't eat junk food.
L68304	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Have a Mac.
L68303	u3893	m258	BIG PINK	No, I'd like the scarf.
L68302	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Wanna Mac?
L68301	u3893	m258	BIG PINK	Come on.
L68300	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'd like to squeeze your titties.
L68299	u3893	m258	BIG PINK	How can I ever thank you?
L68017	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
L68016	u3895	m258	CHRIS	What? What do you want?
L68015	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You don't even know me. I want real respect.
L68014	u3895	m258	CHRIS	"What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said ""Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world."" Think about it. Feel it."
L68013	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
L68012	u3895	m258	CHRIS	You see? You have someone to live for.
L68011	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
L68010	u3895	m258	CHRIS	What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it ? did your girlfriend leave you?
L68009	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
L68008	u3895	m258	CHRIS	What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
L68007	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
L68006	u3895	m258	CHRIS	That's a beautiful name. French?
L68568	u3906	m258	RENE	Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
L68567	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Hey, Rene.
L68365	u3906	m258	RENE	Forget it.
L68364	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I'll make you another one.
L68363	u3906	m258	RENE	You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother ? when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
L68259	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I can't. After the show.
L68258	u3906	m258	RENE	Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
L68257	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	That one's for you.
L68256	u3906	m258	RENE	5:11.
L68255	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	What time is it?
L68254	u3906	m258	RENE	So shut up and keep painting..
L68253	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	So what?
L68252	u3906	m258	RENE	You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
L68251	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
L68250	u3906	m258	RENE	So keep painting.
L68249	u3906	m258	RENE	My point exactly.
L68248	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
L68247	u3906	m258	RENE	Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
L68246	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
L68245	u3906	m258	RENE	Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts ? you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
L68244	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Fuck...  I forgot about that.
L68243	u3906	m258	RENE	Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
L68166	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Jean Michel Basquiat.
L68165	u3906	m258	RENE	I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
L68164	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Can you put me in the ring with him?
L68163	u3906	m258	RENE	"You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read ""Not About Albert Milo?"" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star."
L68047	u3900	m258	GREG	I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
L68046	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	I didn't know.
L68045	u3900	m258	GREG	Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
L68039	u3900	m258	GREG	That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
L68038	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	You don't have any!!!
L68037	u3900	m258	GREG	Yeah.
L68036	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	'Phillips head,' right?
L68035	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	Yeah.
L68034	u3900	m258	GREG	A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
L68033	u3891	m258	BASQUIAT	A what?
L68032	u3900	m258	GREG	Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
L67968	u3899	m258	GINA	I need this?
L67967	u3903	m258	LESHKO	I need this?
L67966	u3899	m258	GINA	I just don't think you're being fair.
L67965	u3903	m258	LESHKO	You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
L67964	u3899	m258	GINA	Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
L67963	u3903	m258	LESHKO	OK! Goodbye!
L68561	u3909	m258	TOXIC	That's ignorant.
L68560	u3905	m258	RAMMELLZEE	You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
L68559	u3909	m258	TOXIC	Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
L68556	u3905	m258	RAMMELLZEE	I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
L68555	u3909	m258	TOXIC	Uh-oh!
L68554	u3905	m258	RAMMELLZEE	Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
L68553	u3909	m258	TOXIC	YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
L95571	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
L95570	u4123	m276	ALESSANDRO	On the plane.
L95569	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Where do you guys want to count?
L95568	u4123	m276	ALESSANDRO	Greetings, Mr. George.
L95541	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Um-hmm.
L95540	u4123	m276	ALESSANDRO	I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
L95537	u4123	m276	ALESSANDRO	Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
L95536	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
L95535	u4123	m276	ALESSANDRO	QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
L95932	u4136	m276	GEORGE	This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
L95931	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
L95930	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Five-thousand per kilo.
L95929	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
L95928	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
L95927	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
L95844	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
L95843	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No honey, I'm alright.
L95740	u4136	m276	GEORGE	That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
L95739	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
L95738	u4136	m276	GEORGE	He what?
L95737	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
L95736	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Motherfucker works fast.
L95735	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
L95734	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What?
L95733	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
L95661	u4136	m276	GEORGE	My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
L95660	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
L95764	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
L95763	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
L95762	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Blanca, por favor.
L95748	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
L95747	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Que va hacer?
L95728	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
L95727	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
L95726	u4124	m276	AUGUSTO	I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
L95343	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
L95342	u4125	m276	BARBARA	George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
L95341	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What?  You're not going to wait for me?
L95340	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
L95339	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
L95338	u4125	m276	BARBARA	What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
L95337	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Baby, you didn't have to come.
L95336	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Surprise.
L95326	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
L95325	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
L95324	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
L95323	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
L95322	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
L95321	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
L95320	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
L95319	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
L95318	u4125	m276	BARBARA	I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
L95317	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
L95316	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
L95315	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Yeah, I don't feel so well.
L95314	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You wanna split?
L95311	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
L95310	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Honey, your nose!
L95291	u4136	m276	GEORGE	We'll take it.
L95290	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Are you kidding?
L95289	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Should we buy it?
L95218	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
L95217	u4125	m276	BARBARA	We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
L95192	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  I am.
L95191	u4125	m276	BARBARA	You happy, baby?
L95190	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
L95189	u4125	m276	BARBARA	What is?
L95188	u4136	m276	GEORGE	This is it for me.
L95169	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Derek!
L95168	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Nothing like this back home.
L95166	u4125	m276	BARBARA	You'll see for yourself.
L95165	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Are you sure this guy is cool?
L95136	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  I am.
L95135	u4125	m276	BARBARA	You happy, baby?
L95134	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
L95133	u4125	m276	BARBARA	What is?
L95132	u4136	m276	GEORGE	This is it for me.
L95113	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Derek!
L95112	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Nothing like this back home.
L95110	u4125	m276	BARBARA	You'll see for yourself.
L95109	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Are you sure this guy is cool?
L95164	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
L95163	u4144	m276	TUNA	Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
L95162	u4125	m276	BARBARA	You can't sell this to your friends.
L95159	u4125	m276	BARBARA	It's garbage.
L95158	u4144	m276	TUNA	I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
L95157	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Tuna, this is crap.
L95108	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
L95107	u4144	m276	TUNA	Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
L95106	u4125	m276	BARBARA	You can't sell this to your friends.
L95103	u4125	m276	BARBARA	It's garbage.
L95102	u4144	m276	TUNA	I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
L95101	u4125	m276	BARBARA	Tuna, this is crap.
L96077	u4126	m276	CALIBANOS	So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
L96076	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
L96075	u4126	m276	CALIBANOS	Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
L96074	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Excuse me?
L96073	u4126	m276	CALIBANOS	Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
L96072	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Something about vengance being best served cold.
L96071	u4126	m276	CALIBANOS	Excuse me?
L96070	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No, I cam here out of my own volition.
L96069	u4126	m276	CALIBANOS	Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
L96068	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yes, I am.
L96067	u4126	m276	CALIBANOS	Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
L95659	u4127	m276	CESAR	Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
L95658	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Mirtha.
L95507	u4127	m276	CESAR	Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
L95506	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I see.  How much?
L95505	u4127	m276	CESAR	You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
L95504	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Excuse me?
L95503	u4127	m276	CESAR	Why are you speaking?
L95482	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You're a fucking amateur!
L95481	u4127	m276	CESAR	The coca is my responsibility!
L95480	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
L95479	u4127	m276	CESAR	I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
L95478	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
L95477	u4127	m276	CESAR	I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
L95476	u4136	m276	GEORGE	My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
L95475	u4127	m276	CESAR	Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
L95474	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What?  Yeah, sure.
L95473	u4127	m276	CESAR	Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
L95471	u4127	m276	CESAR	Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
L95470	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
L95469	u4127	m276	CESAR	Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
L95839	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
L95838	u4128	m276	DEREK	Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
L95834	u4128	m276	DEREK	That was out of line.
L95833	u4136	m276	GEORGE	For calling you a homo.
L95832	u4128	m276	DEREK	You?
L95831	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
L95830	u4128	m276	DEREK	I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
L95829	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I heard.
L95828	u4128	m276	DEREK	Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
L95827	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  She told me.
L95826	u4128	m276	DEREK	Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
L95745	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
L95744	u4128	m276	DEREK	It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
L95567	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
L95566	u4128	m276	DEREK	Nice doing business with you, George.
L95565	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
L95557	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Sell it?
L95556	u4128	m276	DEREK	It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
L95555	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What did I tell you?
L95285	u4128	m276	DEREK	Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
L95284	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
L95253	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
L95252	u4128	m276	DEREK	I don't think so.
L95226	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Barbara and me.  No one else.
L95225	u4128	m276	DEREK	And I only deal with you?
L95224	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
L95223	u4128	m276	DEREK	Goodness.
L95222	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
L95221	u4128	m276	DEREK	Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
L95220	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
L95219	u4128	m276	DEREK	I don't know...
L95216	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
L95215	u4128	m276	DEREK	You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
L95214	u4136	m276	GEORGE	The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
L95184	u4128	m276	DEREK	It's your grass.
L95183	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What the fuck is that?
L95182	u4128	m276	DEREK	I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
L95181	u4136	m276	GEORGE	We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
L95180	u4128	m276	DEREK	Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
L95179	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No.
L95178	u4128	m276	DEREK	I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
L95177	u4136	m276	GEORGE	We want some grass.
L95176	u4128	m276	DEREK	What can I do for you guys?
L95128	u4128	m276	DEREK	It's your grass.
L95127	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What the fuck is that?
L95126	u4128	m276	DEREK	I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
L95125	u4136	m276	GEORGE	We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
L95124	u4128	m276	DEREK	Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
L95123	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No.
L95122	u4128	m276	DEREK	I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
L95121	u4136	m276	GEORGE	We want some grass.
L95120	u4128	m276	DEREK	What can I do for you guys?
L95858	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Get me a six pack.
L95857	u4129	m276	DETECTIVE #1	What's that?
L95856	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Oh hey, one more thing?
L95855	u4129	m276	DETECTIVE #1	George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
L95853	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
L95852	u4129	m276	DETECTIVE #1	No fucking way.
L95851	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
L95778	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
L95777	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
L95774	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I talked to Foreal, Diego.
L95773	u4130	m276	DIEGO	No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
L95772	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You went behind my back and you cut me out.
L95771	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I did not.
L95770	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You fucked me, Diego.
L95769	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
L95768	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No more brothers, Diego.
L95767	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
L95724	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
L95723	u4130	m276	DIEGO	What?
L95722	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Derek Foreal.
L95720	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
L95719	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
L95717	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
L95716	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
L95708	u4136	m276	GEORGE	This is not the time, Diego.
L95707	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
L95706	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
L95700	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
L95699	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
L95698	u4130	m276	DIEGO	What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
L95697	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
L95696	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
L95695	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
L95694	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
L95644	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I love you too, man.
L95643	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I love you, my brother, do you know that?
L95642	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You're a lucky man, Diego.
L95641	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
L95637	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
L95636	u4136	m276	GEORGE	And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
L95635	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
L95634	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Are you comfortable with this?
L95632	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Try the closet.
L95631	u4136	m276	GEORGE	There's no room.
L95630	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Try the back bedroom.
L95629	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Where do I put this!?
L95628	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
L95627	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
L95626	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
L95625	u4130	m276	DIEGO	We're half a million off.
L95624	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm calling it three.
L95623	u4130	m276	DIEGO	It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
L95622	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Three million.  I counted it twice.
L95579	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  You do the talking.
L95578	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
L95577	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Just a friend.
L95576	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
L95575	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
L95574	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
L95573	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
L95572	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George, good to see you, my brother.
L95564	u4136	m276	GEORGE	But to the victor belong the spoils.
L95563	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Touche.
L95562	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
L95561	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
L95559	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Just sell it, Derek.
L95558	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
L95546	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
L95545	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
L95544	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
L95543	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George.
L95533	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I need you to go to Miami.
L95532	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
L95531	u4130	m276	DIEGO	This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
L95530	u4130	m276	DIEGO	That's my George, always thinking.
L95529	u4136	m276	GEORGE	And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
L95528	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I know.
L95527	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
L95526	u4130	m276	DIEGO	A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
L95525	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
L95524	u4130	m276	DIEGO	What's the matter, George?
L95502	u4136	m276	GEORGE	We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
L95501	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Please, continue.
L95468	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Okay.
L95467	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
L95466	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
L95465	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Good to see you, Diego.
L95464	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George, are we gonna do this or not?
L95463	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I just got released five minutes ago.
L95462	u4130	m276	DIEGO	But you must.  It's the only way.
L95461	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
L95460	u4130	m276	DIEGO	You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
L95459	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Slow down, George.  Slow down.
L95458	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
L95457	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
L95456	u4136	m276	GEORGE	How are we doing?
L95455	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
L95454	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, I'm out.
L95453	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
L95452	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Diego?  It's George.
L95451	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Allo?
L95450	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Diego Delgado, please?
L95449	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Great.  I love the Bahamas.
L95448	u4136	m276	GEORGE	We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
L95447	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
L95446	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
L95445	u4130	m276	DIEGO	How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
L95444	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
L95443	u4130	m276	DIEGO	What type of planes do you have?
L95442	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
L95441	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
L95440	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Now do you see what I am saying?
L95439	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
L95438	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
L95437	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Oh my G-d.
L95436	u4130	m276	DIEGO	And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
L95435	u4136	m276	GEORGE	That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
L95434	u4130	m276	DIEGO	No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
L95433	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
L95432	u4130	m276	DIEGO	George?  What do you know about cocaine?
L95431	u4130	m276	DIEGO	You failed because you had the wrong dream.
L95430	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Because they caught me?
L95429	u4130	m276	DIEGO	No, my brother.
L95428	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Because I got caught.
L95427	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
L95426	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I would if I could get some sleep.
L95425	u4130	m276	DIEGO	In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
L95424	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Good night.
L95423	u4130	m276	DIEGO	You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
L95422	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
L95421	u4130	m276	DIEGO	I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
L95404	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What's the other one?
L95403	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
L95402	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I've got to get out of here, Diego.
L95401	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
L95400	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Twenty-six months.
L95399	u4130	m276	DIEGO	You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
L95398	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
L95397	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
L95396	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What kind of project?
L95395	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Nothing.  Just a little project.
L95394	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What do you got there, Diego?
L95393	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Ah, yes.  The murder.
L95392	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Murder.
L95391	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
L95390	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
L95389	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
L95388	u4130	m276	DIEGO	No?
L95387	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Not really, no.
L95386	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
L95385	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't want to talk about it.
L95384	u4130	m276	DIEGO	Your offense?  Why are you here?
L95383	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What?
L95382	u4130	m276	DIEGO	If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
L95811	u4131	m276	DR. BAY	Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
L95810	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Today.
L95809	u4131	m276	DR. BAY	In how long?  A week?
L95808	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
L95807	u4131	m276	DR. BAY	Cocaine?  How much?
L95806	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Coke.
L95805	u4131	m276	DR. BAY	He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
L95863	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Mom.
L95862	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
L95685	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Oh, I see.
L95684	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
L95683	u4132	m276	ERMINE	I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
L95682	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's a family heirloom.
L95356	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
L95355	u4132	m276	ERMINE	G-d, son.
L95354	u4132	m276	ERMINE	You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
L95353	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
L95352	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
L95351	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Barbara.
L95350	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
L95349	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Mexico.
L95348	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Take your boots off.  You're tan.
L95347	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Surprised to see me?
L95308	u4132	m276	ERMINE	The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
L95307	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, layaway.
L95302	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
L95301	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Well, you know.  It's um...
L95681	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
L95680	u4134	m276	FRED	Yeah.  Nice.
L95306	u4132	m276	ERMINE	You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
L95305	u4134	m276	FRED	Who's the cheapskate?
L95304	u4132	m276	ERMINE	That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
L95303	u4134	m276	FRED	Layaway shmayaway.
L95295	u4132	m276	ERMINE	Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you.
L95294	u4134	m276	FRED	I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
L95293	u4132	m276	ERMINE	I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
L95794	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
L95793	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
L95792	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	I'm sorry, George.
L95791	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
L95790	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
L95789	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You're saying life will take care of Diego?
L95788	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
L95787	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
L95786	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
L95785	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I didn't come here to drink scotch.
L95784	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
L95783	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.
L95782	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Diego?
L95781	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, well...
L95780	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	George, you look terrible.
L95618	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Diego is my brother.
L95617	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	And Diego?
L95616	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Money.
L95615	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
L95614	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Keep them coming.
L95613	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Beautiful girls?
L95612	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Sure.
L95611	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Family.
L95610	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, maybe.
L95609	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Power?
L95608	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Freedom.
L95607	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
L95606	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I want money.
L95605	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
L95604	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
L95603	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
L95602	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's beautiful.
L95601	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
L95600	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about.
L95599	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
L95598	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
L95597	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yes, it is.
L95596	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
L95595	u4136	m276	GEORGE	With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
L95594	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
L95593	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yes.
L95592	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
L95591	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Un sapo?
L95590	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
L95589	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
L95588	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It would be my pleasure.
L95587	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
L95586	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Actually, it was three.
L95585	u4133	m276	ESCOBAR	So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
L96017	u4134	m276	FRED	Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
L96016	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I meant every word of it.
L96015	u4134	m276	FRED	That was a beautiful message.
L96014	u4136	m276	GEORGE	"I guess I kind of lost sight of things. ""May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.""  Love, George."
L96011	u4136	m276	GEORGE	That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
L96010	u4134	m276	FRED	...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
L96009	u4134	m276	FRED	That's where you belong...
L96008	u4136	m276	GEORGE	And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
L95875	u4134	m276	FRED	I'll tell her.
L95874	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Tell Mom, you know...
L95873	u4134	m276	FRED	Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
L95872	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
L95871	u4134	m276	FRED	Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
L95870	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Give this to Mom, will you?
L95869	u4134	m276	FRED	Good.
L95868	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No.
L95867	u4134	m276	FRED	You're not going to trial?
L95866	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
L95865	u4134	m276	FRED	She's angry.  It's all over the news.
L95861	u4134	m276	FRED	I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
L95860	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Hi.
L95693	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
L95692	u4134	m276	FRED	No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
L95691	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Dad.
L95690	u4134	m276	FRED	You're like your mother.  You love money.
L95688	u4134	m276	FRED	Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
L95687	u4136	m276	GEORGE	So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
L95370	u4134	m276	FRED	Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
L95369	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
L95368	u4134	m276	FRED	I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
L95367	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
L95366	u4134	m276	FRED	Not mad.
L95365	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You mad at me?
L95364	u4134	m276	FRED	Tough spot.
L95363	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
L95362	u4134	m276	FRED	You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
L95361	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Just low.
L95358	u4134	m276	FRED	...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
L95357	u4136	m276	GEORGE	May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
L95145	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm going to California.
L95144	u4134	m276	FRED	What are you going to do?
L95143	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
L95142	u4134	m276	FRED	Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
L95141	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I know.
L95140	u4134	m276	FRED	That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
L95139	u4136	m276	GEORGE	There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
L95089	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm going to California.
L95088	u4134	m276	FRED	What are you going to do?
L95087	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
L95086	u4134	m276	FRED	Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
L95085	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I know.
L95084	u4134	m276	FRED	That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
L95083	u4136	m276	GEORGE	There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
L96030	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
L96029	u4135	m276	GARCIA	Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
L96024	u4135	m276	GARCIA	He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
L96023	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
L96022	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What about him?
L96021	u4135	m276	GARCIA	You hear about your old friend, Diego?
L96020	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What do you guys want?
L96019	u4135	m276	GARCIA	How are you doing, George?
L95247	u4136	m276	GEORGE	He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
L95246	u4144	m276	TUNA	Source?  What about Derek?
L95243	u4136	m276	GEORGE	The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
L95242	u4144	m276	TUNA	What the fuck are you talking about, man?
L95194	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
L95193	u4144	m276	TUNA	Look what the cat dragged in.
L95173	u4144	m276	TUNA	Tuna.
L95172	u4136	m276	GEORGE	George.
L95161	u4144	m276	TUNA	We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
L95160	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
L95156	u4144	m276	TUNA	You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
L95155	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Figured what out?
L95154	u4144	m276	TUNA	Figured it out.
L95117	u4144	m276	TUNA	Tuna.
L95116	u4136	m276	GEORGE	George.
L95105	u4144	m276	TUNA	We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
L95104	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
L95100	u4144	m276	TUNA	You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
L95099	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Figured what out?
L95098	u4144	m276	TUNA	Figured it out.
L96040	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Better than you.
L96039	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Mirtha, how are you doing?
L96038	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	George, he wasn't asking.
L96037	u4136	m276	GEORGE	He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
L96036	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	"Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were ""Fuck Diego."""
L96035	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.
L96034	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
L96033	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Is she here?  Is she coming?
L96032	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Kristina's fine.
L96031	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
L95959	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
L95958	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Hey, George.  You okay?
L95957	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
L95956	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
L95955	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.
L95954	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
L95953	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, you will.  Of course.
L95952	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
L95951	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
L95950	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
L95949	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
L95948	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
L95947	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
L95946	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	What do you want?
L95901	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
L95900	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
L95899	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
L95895	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
L95894	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What?
L95893	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
L95892	u4136	m276	GEORGE	"Hey, why don't you just put a ""I'm doing cocaine"" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?"
L95891	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
L95890	u4136	m276	GEORGE	There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
L95884	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
L95883	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Not in front of the kid.
L95882	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
L95881	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
L95880	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
L95842	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
L95841	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No, that's alright.
L95825	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Out.
L95824	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Where are you going?
L95823	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
L95822	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Alright.
L95821	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	I said, I've seen it before.
L95820	u4136	m276	GEORGE	But this is...
L95819	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
L95818	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
L95817	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	She did that before.
L95816	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
L95799	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
L95798	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Pablo said no?
L95797	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
L95796	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
L95677	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Put that shit away, they're here.
L95676	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
L95675	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Jesus Christ.
L95672	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I like fire.
L95671	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
L95656	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What is your name?
L95655	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
L95654	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't know.  My name is George.
L95653	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Why are you smiling?
L95652	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Why are you smiling?
L95651	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	I don't think so.
L95650	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Do I know you?
L95649	u4141	m276	MIRTHA	Hello.
L95648	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Hello.
L96099	u4136	m276	GEORGE	After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
L96098	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	I know, Dad.  I love you too.
L96097	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
L96096	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Shhhh.
L96095	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I fucked up.
L96094	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	I know, Dad.  I know...
L96093	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I didn't mean to...
L96092	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	It's alright, Dad.
L96091	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
L95981	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I swear on your life.
L95980	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Swear on my life.
L95979	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I swear.  On my life.
L95978	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	I don't believe you.
L95977	u4136	m276	GEORGE	That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
L95976	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	You swear?
L95975	u4136	m276	GEORGE	There's schools in California.
L95974	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	But I've got school.
L95973	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
L95972	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
L95971	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
L95970	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	You swear?
L95969	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't know.  Maybe California.
L95968	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Where are you going?
L95967	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
L95945	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I'll be here.
L95944	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
L95942	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	California.
L95941	u4136	m276	GEORGE	California, huh?
L95940	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
L95939	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
L95938	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Yeah.
L95937	u4136	m276	GEORGE	California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
L95935	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, sure, whatever.
L95934	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	You mean, like a trip?
L95933	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
L95917	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Do what you want, it's a free country.
L95916	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
L95915	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	What do you want from me?
L95914	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
L95913	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
L95912	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You can call me Dad if you want.
L95911	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	What?
L95910	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Dad.
L95909	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
L95908	u4136	m276	GEORGE	How are you doing?
L95907	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Well, here I am.  See?
L95906	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
L95905	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	What are you doing here?
L95889	u4136	m276	GEORGE	No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
L95888	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	Are we gonna split up?
L95887	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't know.
L95886	u4139	m276	KRISTINA	What's happening to us?
L95885	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
L96106	u4137	m276	GUS	We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
L96105	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Because she's visiting me.
L96104	u4137	m276	GUS	Okay, George.
L96103	u4136	m276	GEORGE	But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
L96102	u4137	m276	GUS	Not today, George.  Time to go back.
L96101	u4136	m276	GEORGE	But I have a visitor.
L96053	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
L96052	u4142	m276	PROSECUTOR	Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
L96051	u4142	m276	PROSECUTOR	Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
L96050	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
L96049	u4142	m276	PROSECUTOR	Do you see him here in the courtroom?
L96048	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yes, I do.
L96047	u4142	m276	PROSECUTOR	Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
L95986	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.
L95985	u4140	m276	LEON	Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
L95984	u4136	m276	GEORGE	You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
L95922	u4140	m276	LEON	They're over at the booth.
L95921	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
L95920	u4140	m276	LEON	You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
L95919	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Who's the co-pilot?
L95918	u4140	m276	LEON	It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
L95282	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
L95281	u4143	m276	SANTIAGO	Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
L95271	u4143	m276	SANTIAGO	Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
L95270	u4136	m276	GEORGE	What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
L95269	u4143	m276	SANTIAGO	Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
L95268	u4136	m276	GEORGE	I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
L95267	u4143	m276	SANTIAGO	Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
L95266	u4136	m276	GEORGE	All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
L95265	u4143	m276	SANTIAGO	Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
L95264	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Very nice.  I'll take it.
L95263	u4143	m276	SANTIAGO	For instance, something like this?
L95262	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yes, I am.
L95261	u4143	m276	SANTIAGO	Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
L95983	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
L95982	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Are we good?
L95926	u4136	m276	GEORGE	That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.
L95925	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
L95924	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Holy shit, Dulli!
L95279	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
L95278	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
L95249	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Who speaks Spanish?
L95248	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
L95245	u4136	m276	GEORGE	So, we need to get to the source.
L95244	u4138	m276	KEVIN	So?
L95241	u4138	m276	KEVIN	What?
L95240	u4136	m276	GEORGE	It's not enough.
L95211	u4138	m276	KEVIN	When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
L95210	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah?
L95207	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
L95206	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah?
L95205	u4138	m276	KEVIN	I wish there was shit like this back home.
L95204	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Stoned?
L95203	u4138	m276	KEVIN	G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
L95202	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Right on.
L95199	u4138	m276	KEVIN	No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
L95198	u4136	m276	GEORGE	This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
L95197	u4138	m276	KEVIN	I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
L95196	u4136	m276	GEORGE	Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
L95195	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
L95273	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Don't be such a pussy.
L95272	u4144	m276	TUNA	I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
L95251	u4138	m276	KEVIN	You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
L95250	u4144	m276	TUNA	This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
L95239	u4144	m276	TUNA	Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
L95238	u4138	m276	KEVIN	What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
L95237	u4144	m276	TUNA	Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
L95236	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
L95213	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
L95212	u4144	m276	TUNA	Smith.  Hampshire....
L95209	u4138	m276	KEVIN	That's right.
L95208	u4144	m276	TUNA	No shit, Kevin?
L95201	u4138	m276	KEVIN	Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
L95200	u4144	m276	TUNA	Nice weed, huh?
L120770	u4331	m289	ACE	Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
L120769	u4350	m289	GREEN	I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
L120738	u4350	m289	GREEN	Why are you doing this to me?
L120737	u4331	m289	ACE	It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
L120734	u4350	m289	GREEN	I can't believe you're doing this.
L120733	u4331	m289	ACE	...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
L120544	u4331	m289	ACE	It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
L120543	u4350	m289	GREEN	What are you talking about?
L120542	u4331	m289	ACE	Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
L120541	u4350	m289	GREEN	What?
L120540	u4331	m289	ACE	Look at yours.
L120539	u4331	m289	ACE	Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
L120538	u4350	m289	GREEN	This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
L120537	u4331	m289	ACE	So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
L120536	u4350	m289	GREEN	But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
L120535	u4331	m289	ACE	I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
L119575	u4331	m289	ACE	...he did what he was told.
L119574	u4350	m289	GREEN	Thank you.
L121050	u4365	m289	SENATOR	Yes, you were.
L121049	u4331	m289	ACE	You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
L121048	u4331	m289	ACE	I was in the building!
L121047	u4365	m289	SENATOR	You were in the m- You were in the building.
L121046	u4331	m289	ACE	Was I at that dinner?
L121045	u4365	m289	SENATOR	You were wandering around.
L121044	u4331	m289	ACE	Was I at that dinner?
L121043	u4365	m289	SENATOR	You were wandering around.
L121042	u4331	m289	ACE	Was I at that dinner?
L121041	u4365	m289	SENATOR	You were wandering around.
L121040	u4331	m289	ACE	Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
L121039	u4365	m289	SENATOR	The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
L121038	u4331	m289	ACE	He's lying.
L121037	u4365	m289	SENATOR	Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
L121036	u4331	m289	ACE	Liar.
L121035	u4365	m289	SENATOR	Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
L121034	u4331	m289	ACE	I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
L121033	u4365	m289	SENATOR	That's right.
L121032	u4331	m289	ACE	You were never my guest?!
L121031	u4365	m289	SENATOR	I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
L119696	u4331	m289	ACE	Good to see ya.  William would you...
L119695	u4365	m289	SENATOR	Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
L119694	u4331	m289	ACE	Hello, Senator.
L119693	u4365	m289	SENATOR	Hi, Ace.
L121115	u4331	m289	ACE	I can't do that.
L121114	u4369	m289	STONE	I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
L121113	u4331	m289	ACE	All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
L121112	u4369	m289	STONE	They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
L121111	u4331	m289	ACE	I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
L121110	u4369	m289	STONE	What do you propose?
L121109	u4331	m289	ACE	Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
L121108	u4369	m289	STONE	The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
L121107	u4331	m289	ACE	Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
L121106	u4369	m289	STONE	These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
L121105	u4331	m289	ACE	First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
L121099	u4331	m289	ACE	It's a pity in this...
L121098	u4369	m289	STONE	He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
L119590	u4369	m289	STONE	Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
L119589	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm serious. No interference.
L119588	u4369	m289	STONE	You got it.
L119587	u4331	m289	ACE	It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
L119586	u4369	m289	STONE	Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
L119585	u4331	m289	ACE	But what happens when they do find out?
L119584	u4369	m289	STONE	You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
L119573	u4369	m289	STONE	...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
L119572	u4331	m289	ACE	But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
L119571	u4369	m289	STONE	On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
L119570	u4331	m289	ACE	He even played golf with the President.
L119569	u4369	m289	STONE	Philip, if you would rise.
L119568	u4331	m289	ACE	A powerful man.
L119567	u4369	m289	STONE	This is a very auspicious occasion.
L119566	u4331	m289	ACE	As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
L121880	u4338	m289	COP #1	Speeding?
L121879	u4331	m289	ACE	Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
L121877	u4338	m289	COP #1	Hold on a second.
L121876	u4331	m289	ACE	Hey!
L121875	u4338	m289	COP #1	Wait, hold on a second.
L121874	u4331	m289	ACE	Stop -
L121844	u4338	m289	COP #1	All right, take care.
L121843	u4331	m289	ACE	Okay, Randy. Thank you.
L121837	u4331	m289	ACE	Congratulations.
L121836	u4338	m289	COP #1	Yeah.
L121835	u4331	m289	ACE	Oh, good.
L121834	u4338	m289	COP #1	Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
L121833	u4331	m289	ACE	Fine, fine. How's your family?
L121832	u4338	m289	COP #1	No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
L121831	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
L121818	u4331	m289	ACE	...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
L121817	u4338	m289	COP #1	No, you're not calm.
L121594	u4338	m289	COP #1	Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
L121593	u4331	m289	ACE	...been right, but who knows?
L121582	u4331	m289	ACE	The worst was Blue.
L121581	u4338	m289	COP #1	Watch it, partner, watch it!
L121580	u4331	m289	ACE	...stupid things.
L119853	u4331	m289	ACE	I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
L119852	u4338	m289	COP #1	Excuse me.
L119851	u4331	m289	ACE	Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
L121280	u4356	m289	LESTER	You got it.  Schmuck.  All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
L121279	u4331	m289	ACE	Right back.
L121278	u4356	m289	LESTER	I'll call you right back.
L121277	u4331	m289	ACE	Right away.
L121276	u4356	m289	LESTER	Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
L121275	u4331	m289	ACE	702 472 1862.
L121274	u4356	m289	LESTER	So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
L121273	u4356	m289	LESTER	Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
L121272	u4331	m289	ACE	You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
L121269	u4356	m289	LESTER	Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
L121268	u4331	m289	ACE	I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
L121267	u4331	m289	ACE	...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
L121266	u4331	m289	ACE	Lester...
L121265	u4356	m289	LESTER	She's not here, Sam.
L121264	u4331	m289	ACE	...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
L121263	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
L121262	u4356	m289	LESTER	Hello.
L121261	u4331	m289	ACE	Hello.
L121249	u4356	m289	LESTER	Hey, little Dale Evans.
L121248	u4331	m289	ACE	M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
L120586	u4356	m289	LESTER	Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
L120585	u4331	m289	ACE	You fuckin' piece of shit.
L120584	u4356	m289	LESTER	Okay.
L120583	u4331	m289	ACE	You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
L120582	u4356	m289	LESTER	Yeah, yeah. I know that.
L120581	u4331	m289	ACE	She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
L119843	u4331	m289	ACE	He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
L119842	u4356	m289	LESTER	Yeah.
L119830	u4356	m289	LESTER	Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
L119829	u4331	m289	ACE	But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
L120140	u4331	m289	ACE	Well...
L120139	u4335	m289	BANKER	No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
L120138	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, sure I do. Why?
L120137	u4335	m289	BANKER	Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
L120135	u4335	m289	BANKER	That's right.
L120134	u4331	m289	ACE	So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
L120133	u4335	m289	BANKER	Now this is just a signature card.
L121657	u4331	m289	ACE	Ohhh...
L121656	u4333	m289	AMY	I don't know.
L121655	u4331	m289	ACE	You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
L121654	u4333	m289	AMY	I don't know.
L121653	u4331	m289	ACE	When did this happen, honey?
L121651	u4333	m289	AMY	Oh, no, please, please.
L121650	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
L121649	u4333	m289	AMY	Mommy.
L121648	u4331	m289	ACE	What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
L121647	u4333	m289	AMY	Dad!
L121646	u4331	m289	ACE	Wh-wh -
L121645	u4333	m289	AMY	I can't! I'm tied!
L121644	u4331	m289	ACE	Amy! Amy, open the door!
L121643	u4333	m289	AMY	Help, Daddy!
L121642	u4331	m289	ACE	Hello? Hello! Ginger.
L121439	u4333	m289	AMY	Okay.
L121438	u4331	m289	ACE	Oh. Have a good day at school.
L121681	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
L121680	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
L121679	u4359	m289	NICKY	She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
L121678	u4331	m289	ACE	I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
L121677	u4359	m289	NICKY	Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
L121673	u4331	m289	ACE	I'll be right there.
L121672	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah, she's here.
L121671	u4331	m289	ACE	She's there with you?  She's there with you?
L121670	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
L121669	u4331	m289	ACE	...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
L121668	u4331	m289	ACE	Well...
L121667	u4359	m289	NICKY	...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
L121666	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well...
L121665	u4331	m289	ACE	How'd you know I was here?
L121664	u4331	m289	ACE	No, I'm not okay.
L121663	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
L121662	u4331	m289	ACE	Nick?
L121661	u4359	m289	NICKY	It's me.
L121660	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, uh, who's this?
L121659	u4359	m289	NICKY	Sammy.
L121658	u4331	m289	ACE	Hello.
L121338	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
L121337	u4331	m289	ACE	She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
L121336	u4359	m289	NICKY	I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
L121335	u4331	m289	ACE	I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
L121334	u4359	m289	NICKY	I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
L121331	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
L121330	u4359	m289	NICKY	She was afraid to call you.
L121329	u4331	m289	ACE	And what'd she want?
L121328	u4359	m289	NICKY	I just told you. She called me.
L121327	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah.
L121326	u4359	m289	NICKY	Ginger called me.
L121224	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
L121223	u4359	m289	NICKY	Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
L121222	u4331	m289	ACE	Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
L121221	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
L121220	u4331	m289	ACE	What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
L121178	u4359	m289	NICKY	Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
L121177	u4331	m289	ACE	You never - ?
L121176	u4359	m289	NICKY	Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
L121175	u4331	m289	ACE	...you? Do you remember what I told you?
L121174	u4359	m289	NICKY	Back -
L121173	u4331	m289	ACE	No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
L121172	u4359	m289	NICKY	Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
L121171	u4331	m289	ACE	Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
L121170	u4359	m289	NICKY	You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
L121169	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
L121168	u4359	m289	NICKY	Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
L121167	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
L121166	u4359	m289	NICKY	You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
L121165	u4331	m289	ACE	What are you -
L121164	u4359	m289	NICKY	I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
L121163	u4331	m289	ACE	I -
L121162	u4359	m289	NICKY	Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
L121161	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
L121160	u4359	m289	NICKY	You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
L121159	u4331	m289	ACE	I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
L121158	u4359	m289	NICKY	No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
L121157	u4331	m289	ACE	I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
L121156	u4359	m289	NICKY	What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
L121155	u4331	m289	ACE	What people?
L121154	u4359	m289	NICKY	Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
L121136	u4359	m289	NICKY	Don't ask questions. Just be there.
L121135	u4331	m289	ACE	Why?
L121134	u4359	m289	NICKY	...hundred yards further down the road.
L121133	u4359	m289	NICKY	No, a...
L121132	u4331	m289	ACE	What - what, Caesar's?
L121131	u4359	m289	NICKY	Meet me at three.
L121130	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah.
L120933	u4331	m289	ACE	And at the...
L120932	u4359	m289	NICKY	Practice enough this week, you prick?
L120931	u4331	m289	ACE	...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
L120926	u4331	m289	ACE	The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
L120925	u4359	m289	NICKY	I see you, you motherfuckers.
L120924	u4359	m289	NICKY	Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
L120899	u4359	m289	NICKY	The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
L120898	u4331	m289	ACE	Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
L120889	u4331	m289	ACE	Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
L120888	u4359	m289	NICKY	Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
L120887	u4331	m289	ACE	I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
L120886	u4359	m289	NICKY	Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
L120885	u4331	m289	ACE	This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
L120884	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
L120883	u4359	m289	NICKY	A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
L120882	u4331	m289	ACE	That's right, yeah.
L120881	u4359	m289	NICKY	It's none of my business?
L120880	u4331	m289	ACE	Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
L120879	u4359	m289	NICKY	And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
L120878	u4331	m289	ACE	Okay?
L120877	u4359	m289	NICKY	She came to talk to me...
L120876	u4331	m289	ACE	...don't do it to me...
L120875	u4359	m289	NICKY	...to me.
L120874	u4331	m289	ACE	Please...
L120873	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, she came to talk...
L120872	u4331	m289	ACE	I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
L120871	u4359	m289	NICKY	The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
L120870	u4331	m289	ACE	Listen, I would -
L120869	u4359	m289	NICKY	No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
L120868	u4331	m289	ACE	All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
L120867	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
L120866	u4331	m289	ACE	Now, what does she have to do with all this?
L120865	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.
L120864	u4331	m289	ACE	My wife?
L120863	u4359	m289	NICKY	You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
L120862	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah.
L120861	u4359	m289	NICKY	...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
L120860	u4331	m289	ACE	All right.
L120859	u4359	m289	NICKY	A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
L120858	u4331	m289	ACE	All right.
L120857	u4359	m289	NICKY	Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
L120856	u4331	m289	ACE	Yes, you lost your control.
L120855	u4359	m289	NICKY	I lost control?
L120854	u4331	m289	ACE	You lost your control.
L120853	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.
L120852	u4331	m289	ACE	What happened to me? What happened to you?
L120851	u4359	m289	NICKY	What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
L120850	u4331	m289	ACE	Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
L120849	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah?
L120848	u4331	m289	ACE	Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
L120847	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
L120846	u4331	m289	ACE	I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
L120845	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
L120844	u4331	m289	ACE	That's all taken out of context. Okay.
L120843	u4359	m289	NICKY	You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
L120842	u4331	m289	ACE	...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
L120841	u4359	m289	NICKY	Fine.
L120840	u4331	m289	ACE	I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
L120839	u4359	m289	NICKY	All right, fine.
L120838	u4331	m289	ACE	I'll be honest with you.
L120837	u4359	m289	NICKY	Just say so.
L120836	u4331	m289	ACE	I don't wanna come along with you.
L120835	u4359	m289	NICKY	You should say so.
L120834	u4331	m289	ACE	No, I don't wanna come -
L120833	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
L120832	u4331	m289	ACE	Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
L120831	u4359	m289	NICKY	Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
L120830	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
L120829	u4359	m289	NICKY	Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
L120828	u4331	m289	ACE	What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
L120827	u4359	m289	NICKY	You think he got the point?
L120810	u4331	m289	ACE	Hey.
L120809	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, Ace.
L120796	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
L120795	u4331	m289	ACE	...very difficult to get in.
L120794	u4331	m289	ACE	It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
L120793	u4359	m289	NICKY	No, no it's okay.
L120787	u4359	m289	NICKY	Listen...
L120786	u4331	m289	ACE	Hello.
L120461	u4359	m289	NICKY	Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
L120460	u4331	m289	ACE	- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
L120412	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, Rich.
L120411	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
L120327	u4359	m289	NICKY	I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
L120326	u4331	m289	ACE	It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
L120325	u4331	m289	ACE	In so many words, yes.
L120324	u4359	m289	NICKY	In other words, I'm fucked.
L120323	u4331	m289	ACE	Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
L120322	u4359	m289	NICKY	Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
L120321	u4331	m289	ACE	Nope, there's no way.
L120320	u4359	m289	NICKY	Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
L120318	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
L120317	u4359	m289	NICKY	' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
L120316	u4359	m289	NICKY	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
L120315	u4331	m289	ACE	Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
L120255	u4359	m289	NICKY	All right.
L120254	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
L120253	u4359	m289	NICKY	What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
L120252	u4331	m289	ACE	Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
L120251	u4359	m289	NICKY	That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
L120250	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
L120249	u4359	m289	NICKY	Why, somebody's complaining?
L120248	u4331	m289	ACE	You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
L120244	u4331	m289	ACE	Between...
L120243	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
L120224	u4331	m289	ACE	You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
L120223	u4359	m289	NICKY	But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
L120219	u4359	m289	NICKY	Thanks, pal.
L120218	u4331	m289	ACE	Okay.
L120217	u4359	m289	NICKY	All right, Ace?
L120216	u4359	m289	NICKY	I'm sorry about this. Really.
L120215	u4331	m289	ACE	If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
L120200	u4359	m289	NICKY	What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
L120199	u4331	m289	ACE	So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
L120198	u4331	m289	ACE	Then he called me a faggot.
L120197	u4359	m289	NICKY	What?
L120196	u4331	m289	ACE	...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
L120195	u4331	m289	ACE	He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
L120194	u4359	m289	NICKY	No.
L120193	u4331	m289	ACE	No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
L120167	u4331	m289	ACE	You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
L120166	u4359	m289	NICKY	So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
L120165	u4331	m289	ACE	Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
L120164	u4331	m289	ACE	I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
L120158	u4359	m289	NICKY	Four aces, Doc.
L120157	u4331	m289	ACE	And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
L120149	u4331	m289	ACE	It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
L120148	u4359	m289	NICKY	...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
L120143	u4359	m289	NICKY	To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
L120142	u4331	m289	ACE	...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
L120066	u4359	m289	NICKY	It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
L120065	u4331	m289	ACE	When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
L119946	u4359	m289	NICKY	Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
L119945	u4331	m289	ACE	Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
L119944	u4331	m289	ACE	And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
L119943	u4359	m289	NICKY	Ohh!
L119908	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
L119907	u4359	m289	NICKY	But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
L119903	u4359	m289	NICKY	Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
L119902	u4331	m289	ACE	Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
L119901	u4359	m289	NICKY	I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
L119900	u4331	m289	ACE	Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
L119899	u4359	m289	NICKY	You mean, I have your permission?
L119898	u4331	m289	ACE	No, of course not.
L119897	u4359	m289	NICKY	What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
L119896	u4331	m289	ACE	After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
L119889	u4331	m289	ACE	Honey, come here.
L119888	u4359	m289	NICKY	Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
L119887	u4331	m289	ACE	Ginger.
L119886	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.
L119885	u4331	m289	ACE	Somethin', huh?
L119884	u4359	m289	NICKY	Okay, Sammy.
L119875	u4331	m289	ACE	Hey.
L119874	u4359	m289	NICKY	...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
L119848	u4331	m289	ACE	I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
L119847	u4359	m289	NICKY	You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
L119846	u4331	m289	ACE	But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
L119677	u4359	m289	NICKY	Listen...
L119676	u4331	m289	ACE	While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
L119675	u4331	m289	ACE	Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
L119674	u4359	m289	NICKY	What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
L119661	u4359	m289	NICKY	If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
L119660	u4331	m289	ACE	Eight.
L119659	u4359	m289	NICKY	It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
L119651	u4331	m289	ACE	How did Nicky collect?
L119650	u4359	m289	NICKY	They payin'?
L119649	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
L119605	u4359	m289	NICKY	If his girlfriend was knocked up.
L119604	u4331	m289	ACE	I'll take Columbia for twenty.
L119598	u4331	m289	ACE	Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
L119597	u4359	m289	NICKY	He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
L119596	u4331	m289	ACE	Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
L119595	u4359	m289	NICKY	You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
L119583	u4331	m289	ACE	You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
L119582	u4359	m289	NICKY	...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
L119519	u4359	m289	NICKY	Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
L119518	u4331	m289	ACE	But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
L119513	u4359	m289	NICKY	Matter of fact...
L119512	u4331	m289	ACE	...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
L120674	u4373	m289	WEBB	You bet.
L120673	u4331	m289	ACE	No problem.  Sorry.
L120672	u4373	m289	WEBB	Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
L120671	u4331	m289	ACE	Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
L120670	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
L120669	u4373	m289	WEBB	Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
L120668	u4331	m289	ACE	I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
L120667	u4373	m289	WEBB	You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
L120666	u4331	m289	ACE	I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
L120665	u4373	m289	WEBB	Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
L120664	u4331	m289	ACE	Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
L120663	u4373	m289	WEBB	Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
L120662	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
L120661	u4373	m289	WEBB	Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
L120657	u4331	m289	ACE	No, that's quite all right.
L120656	u4373	m289	WEBB	Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
L120655	u4373	m289	WEBB	Oh, thank you, sir.
L120654	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
L120653	u4373	m289	WEBB	Hey, it is my pleasure.
L120652	u4331	m289	ACE	How do you do?
L120651	u4373	m289	WEBB	Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
L119632	u4331	m289	ACE	Seven o'clock.
L119631	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Seven o'clock?
L119630	u4331	m289	ACE	I'll come by.
L119629	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Okay. You come by the house?
L119628	u4331	m289	ACE	Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
L119627	u4348	m289	GAGGI	You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
L119626	u4331	m289	ACE	Well, that's why they paid so well.
L119625	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
L121526	u4331	m289	ACE	Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
L121525	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Hello.
L121120	u4331	m289	ACE	Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
L121119	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
L121118	u4331	m289	ACE	...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
L121117	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
L119891	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Good to meet you.
L119890	u4331	m289	ACE	This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
L119863	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	All right, we're clear.
L119862	u4331	m289	ACE	I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
L119861	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
L119860	u4331	m289	ACE	Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
L119857	u4331	m289	ACE	And they were usually right.
L119856	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	You go and put your things away.
L119855	u4331	m289	ACE	They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
L119854	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
L121861	u4331	m289	ACE	Half - I'm comin' down. 
L121860	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Ace, listen to me.
L121859	u4331	m289	ACE	Half of everything is mine.
L121858	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	No, Ace.
L121857	u4331	m289	ACE	Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
L121851	u4331	m289	ACE	She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-
L121850	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	What can I do?
L121849	u4331	m289	ACE	You've got to stop her.
L121848	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	I-I'm sorry, Sam.
L121847	u4331	m289	ACE	Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
L120812	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Yeah, refill'd be great.
L120811	u4331	m289	ACE	Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
L120240	u4331	m289	ACE	No. Just stop everything.
L120239	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	It's always been our policy -
L120238	u4331	m289	ACE	That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
L120237	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
L120236	u4331	m289	ACE	...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
L120235	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	...and she doesn't always -
L120234	u4331	m289	ACE	She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
L120233	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
L120232	u4331	m289	ACE	'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
L120231	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	...position...
L120230	u4331	m289	ACE	I...
L120229	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	...trying to offer you the respect that your...
L120228	u4331	m289	ACE	Why is she eight pounds over?
L120227	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	Well, sir, I was just...
L120226	u4331	m289	ACE	Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
L120225	u4368	m289	STAGE MANAGER	Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
L121725	u4331	m289	ACE	Okay. 
L121724	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	I-I'll do it.
L121723	u4331	m289	ACE	Right away. Okay?
L121722	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	Okay. Just take it easy.
L121721	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
L121720	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	Who's this?
L121719	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
L121201	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
L121200	u4331	m289	ACE	No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
L121199	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
L121198	u4331	m289	ACE	Oh, no.
L121197	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	Now, he's really pissed.
L121194	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
L121193	u4331	m289	ACE	What is it?
L121192	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	Sam, we got a problem.
L121184	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	Here we go. Good luck.
L121183	u4331	m289	ACE	L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
L121182	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	To Abraham Lincoln.
L120242	u4331	m289	ACE	I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
L120241	u4366	m289	SHERBERT	This woman's an institution.

L121390	u4331	m289	ACE	Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
L121389	u4331	m289	ACE	At the most, which is impossible for him.
L121388	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah.
L121387	u4331	m289	ACE	But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?

L121383	u4331	m289	ACE	First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
L121382	u4331	m289	ACE	The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.

L121351	u4349	m289	GINGER	I gotta tell ya...
L121350	u4331	m289	ACE	What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
L121349	u4349	m289	GINGER	I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.

L121345	u4331	m289	ACE	What do you mean?
L121344	u4349	m289	GINGER	Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.

L121332	u4349	m289	GINGER	Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
L121235	u4331	m289	ACE	Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
L121234	u4349	m289	GINGER	We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
L121233	u4331	m289	ACE	I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon.

L120699	u4331	m289	ACE	How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
L120698	u4349	m289	GINGER	No, you don't.

L120679	u4331	m289	ACE	Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
L120678	u4349	m289	GINGER	I didn't take your pills.
L120677	u4331	m289	ACE	Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
L120676	u4349	m289	GINGER	Huh?
L120589	u4331	m289	ACE	Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
L120588	u4349	m289	GINGER	No, he didn't.
L120587	u4331	m289	ACE	You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
L120571	u4331	m289	ACE	Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
L120570	u4349	m289	GINGER	You can trust me.
L120569	u4331	m289	ACE	You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust.

L120568	u4349	m289	GINGER	Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
L120567	u4331	m289	ACE	What are you talkin' a- ?
L120566	u4349	m289	GINGER	Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
L120565	u4331	m289	ACE	Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
L120564	u4349	m289	GINGER	No.
L120563	u4331	m289	ACE	Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
L120561	u4331	m289	ACE	Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
L120560	u4349	m289	GINGER	I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
L120559	u4331	m289	ACE	Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
L120558	u4349	m289	GINGER	Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
L120557	u4331	m289	ACE	Why do you need that much?
L120556	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah.
L120555	u4331	m289	ACE	Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
L120554	u4349	m289	GINGER	Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
L120553	u4331	m289	ACE	Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
L120552	u4349	m289	GINGER	You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.

L120291	u4349	m289	GINGER	Oh, fabulous.
L120290	u4331	m289	ACE	But as much as they loved her...
L120289	u4349	m289	GINGER	Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
L120273	u4331	m289	ACE	She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
L120272	u4349	m289	GINGER	Hi. Nice to see you.
L120130	u4331	m289	ACE	So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
L120129	u4349	m289	GINGER	Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
L120128	u4331	m289	ACE	Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
L120125	u4331	m289	ACE	All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
L120124	u4349	m289	GINGER	Okay.
L120123	u4331	m289	ACE	Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

L120121	u4331	m289	ACE	The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
L120120	u4349	m289	GINGER	You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
L120119	u4331	m289	ACE	You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
L120118	u4349	m289	GINGER	So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
L120115	u4349	m289	GINGER	Oh...

L120104	u4349	m289	GINGER	Okay.
L120103	u4331	m289	ACE	Want to go? Let's go back in.

L120094	u4349	m289	GINGER	I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
L120093	u4331	m289	ACE	Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
L120092	u4349	m289	GINGER	I'm not crying. 
L120091	u4331	m289	ACE	Why're you crying?
L120090	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah.
L120089	u4331	m289	ACE	You all right?
L120064	u4331	m289	ACE	Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
L120063	u4349	m289	GINGER	What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
L120062	u4331	m289	ACE	You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
L120061	u4349	m289	GINGER	If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
L120060	u4331	m289	ACE	No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
L120059	u4349	m289	GINGER	Understand?  I'm sorry.
L120058	u4331	m289	ACE	I - I - I...
L120057	u4349	m289	GINGER	I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
L120056	u4331	m289	ACE	Yeah, I know all that.
L120055	u4349	m289	GINGER	You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
L120054	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
L120053	u4349	m289	GINGER	You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
L120052	u4331	m289	ACE	I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
L120051	u4349	m289	GINGER	You got the wrong girl, Sam.
L120050	u4331	m289	ACE	I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
L120049	u4349	m289	GINGER	What, are you trying to handicap me?
L120048	u4331	m289	ACE	We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
L120047	u4331	m289	ACE	Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
L119841	u4349	m289	GINGER	Good luck.
L119840	u4331	m289	ACE	The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
L119821	u4349	m289	GINGER	Thanks a lot.
L119820	u4331	m289	ACE	...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.

L119815	u4331	m289	ACE	She took care of the dealers...
L119800	u4331	m289	ACE	That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.

L119798	u4331	m289	ACE	Any change?
L119789	u4349	m289	GINGER	Hello.

L121060	u4346	m289	FEMALE NEWSCASTER	...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
L121059	u4331	m289	ACE	Bullshit! Bullshit!

L120523	u4331	m289	ACE	Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.

L120449	u4332	m289	AL	I didn't give 'em the m-
L120448	u4359	m289	NICKY	No, no? You didn't?
L120446	u4359	m289	NICKY	You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
L120445	u4332	m289	AL	Yeah.
L120444	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah?
L120443	u4332	m289	AL	A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
L120442	u4359	m289	NICKY	Mm.
L120441	u4332	m289	AL	...I got muscled on the street.
L120440	u4359	m289	NICKY	Mm.
L120439	u4332	m289	AL	When I left here with the money...
L121291	u4356	m289	LESTER	No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face.
L121290	u4333	m289	AMY	You shut up.
L121289	u4356	m289	LESTER	You know where she gets this from!
L121288	u4356	m289	LESTER	Shut your mouth!
L121287	u4333	m289	AMY	I don't want to go to Europe.
L121284	u4356	m289	LESTER	We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
L121283	u4333	m289	AMY	I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
L121282	u4356	m289	LESTER	Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
L120731	u4336	m289	BORELLI	You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
L120730	u4361	m289	PISCANO	Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
L120729	u4336	m289	BORELLI	Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
L120728	u4361	m289	PISCANO	Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
L120727	u4336	m289	BORELLI	You gotta go back out there.
L120726	u4361	m289	PISCANO	Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
L120725	u4336	m289	BORELLI	What expenses?
L120724	u4361	m289	PISCANO	Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
L120723	u4336	m289	BORELLI	You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
L120718	u4361	m289	PISCANO	What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
L120717	u4336	m289	BORELLI	Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
L120716	u4361	m289	PISCANO	I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
L120825	u4359	m289	NICKY	Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
L120824	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Sam?
L120823	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
L120822	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	You can't talk to me like...
L120821	u4359	m289	NICKY	You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
L120820	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
L120819	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
L120818	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
L120817	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
L120816	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Well, I've been busy. 
L120815	u4359	m289	NICKY	I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
L120814	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Hi. Good.
L120813	u4359	m289	NICKY	No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
L120397	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
L120396	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Yes.
L120395	u4359	m289	NICKY	I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
L120394	u4359	m289	NICKY	So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
L120393	u4359	m289	NICKY	Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
L120392	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
L120391	u4359	m289	NICKY	But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
L120390	u4337	m289	CHARLIE CLARK	Yeah, that works out.

L121803	u4339	m289	COP #2	Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
L121802	u4338	m289	COP #1	All right. Okay, okay.

L119941	u4341	m289	DETECTIVE JOHNSON	It's instinctive, you know.
L119940	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
L119939	u4341	m289	DETECTIVE JOHNSON	You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
L119938	u4359	m289	NICKY	...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
L119937	u4341	m289	DETECTIVE JOHNSON	Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
L119936	u4359	m289	NICKY	Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
L119935	u4341	m289	DETECTIVE JOHNSON	Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
L119934	u4359	m289	NICKY	Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
L119933	u4341	m289	DETECTIVE JOHNSON	Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.

L121185	u4342	m289	DOMINICK	Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
L121181	u4342	m289	DOMINICK	Yeah. Fuck him.
L121180	u4359	m289	NICKY	Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
L120403	u4342	m289	DOMINICK	Fuckers!
L120402	u4359	m289	NICKY	I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
L120400	u4342	m289	DOMINICK	Is that the last one?
L120399	u4359	m289	NICKY	...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.

L119966	u4343	m289	EDDY	Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
L119965	u4359	m289	NICKY	I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
L119960	u4359	m289	NICKY	Uh-huh.
L119959	u4343	m289	EDDY	Carmine left?
L119958	u4359	m289	NICKY	Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
L119954	u4343	m289	EDDY	Oh.

L119949	u4343	m289	EDDY	Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
L121945	u4344	m289	FBI AGENT #10	We can't help him if -
L121944	u4363	m289	PISCANO'S WIFE	Artie! Artie!
L121943	u4344	m289	FBI AGENT #10	Stay out of the way!
L121942	u4363	m289	PISCANO'S WIFE	No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
L121941	u4344	m289	FBI AGENT #10	Calm down! Calm down!
L121940	u4363	m289	PISCANO'S WIFE	Artie!
L121891	u4349	m289	GINGER	But I'm just trying to leave.
L121890	u4345	m289	FBI AGENT #2	We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
L121889	u4349	m289	GINGER	What?
L121888	u4345	m289	FBI AGENT #2	We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
L121887	u4349	m289	GINGER	For what?
L121886	u4345	m289	FBI AGENT #2	We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
L121567	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
L121566	u4358	m289	MARINO	I understand.
L121565	u4348	m289	GAGGI	You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
L121564	u4358	m289	MARINO	No problem.
L121563	u4348	m289	GAGGI	I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
L121562	u4358	m289	MARINO	He's good. He's fine.
L121561	u4348	m289	GAGGI	I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
L121560	u4358	m289	MARINO	Hm.
L121559	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
L121558	u4358	m289	MARINO	I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
L121557	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Are you sure?
L121556	u4358	m289	MARINO	No. I ain't see anything like that.
L121555	u4358	m289	MARINO	So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
L121554	u4358	m289	MARINO	Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
L121553	u4358	m289	MARINO	What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
L121552	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
L121551	u4358	m289	MARINO	I always tell you the truth, Remo.
L121550	u4348	m289	GAGGI	I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
L121549	u4358	m289	MARINO	Of course, Remo.
L121548	u4348	m289	GAGGI	It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
L121547	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Frankie, I want to ask you something.
L120914	u4358	m289	MARINO	I'll tell him, Remo.
L120913	u4348	m289	GAGGI	You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
L120912	u4358	m289	MARINO	I know.
L120911	u4348	m289	GAGGI	And I mean... that's no good.
L120910	u4358	m289	MARINO	What're you gonna do?
L120909	u4348	m289	GAGGI	It's in all the papers.
L120908	u4358	m289	MARINO	I know.
L120907	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
L120906	u4358	m289	MARINO	Yeah, I heard, yeah.
L120905	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
L120488	u4348	m289	GAGGI	E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
L120487	u4358	m289	MARINO	I'll take care of it, Remo.
L120486	u4348	m289	GAGGI	...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
L120475	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Fine, fine.
L120474	u4358	m289	MARINO	How are you?
L120473	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Hey, Frankie.
L120480	u4348	m289	GAGGI	And how are things going down there?
L120479	u4359	m289	NICKY	But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
L120478	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Uh-huh. Good.
L119645	u4359	m289	NICKY	Want me to take this for you? 
L119644	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Fine.
L119643	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.
L119642	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
L119641	u4359	m289	NICKY	All right.
L119640	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
L119639	u4359	m289	NICKY	Mm.
L119638	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
L119637	u4359	m289	NICKY	Mm.
L119636	u4348	m289	GAGGI	T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
L119635	u4359	m289	NICKY	I'll be right out.
L119634	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
L119624	u4359	m289	NICKY	Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
L119623	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Ace.
L119616	u4348	m289	GAGGI	That's enough now!
L119615	u4359	m289	NICKY	I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
L119614	u4348	m289	GAGGI	Ma che cazzo!
L119613	u4359	m289	NICKY	But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
L119558	u4359	m289	NICKY	Definitely the most important guy in this room.
L119557	u4348	m289	GAGGI	You got a round figure on it?
L121755	u4359	m289	NICKY	Okay, yeah.
L121754	u4349	m289	GINGER	You fucked with me for the last time!
L121753	u4359	m289	NICKY	All right. Be careful.
L121752	u4349	m289	GINGER	I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
L121751	u4359	m289	NICKY	All right, all right.
L121750	u4349	m289	GINGER	I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
L121749	u4359	m289	NICKY	Get the fuck out of here.
L121742	u4359	m289	NICKY	Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
L121741	u4349	m289	GINGER	Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
L121739	u4359	m289	NICKY	How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-

L121737	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
L121736	u4349	m289	GINGER	Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
L121735	u4359	m289	NICKY	I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
L121734	u4349	m289	GINGER	If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
L121733	u4359	m289	NICKY	I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
L121732	u4349	m289	GINGER	Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
L121731	u4359	m289	NICKY	What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
L121498	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah. Uh-huh -
L121497	u4359	m289	NICKY	It's what you want?
L121496	u4349	m289	GINGER	Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L121495	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
L121494	u4349	m289	GINGER	Nicky, please...
L121493	u4359	m289	NICKY	Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
L121492	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah.
L121491	u4359	m289	NICKY	A sponsor.
L121490	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah.
L121489	u4359	m289	NICKY	Is that what you want?
L121488	u4349	m289	GINGER	I do. I need a new sponsor.
L121487	u4349	m289	GINGER	I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
L121486	u4359	m289	NICKY	Come on. Don't be scared.
L121485	u4349	m289	GINGER	I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
L121484	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yes, you are.
L121483	u4349	m289	GINGER	I'm not as tough as you think I am.
L121482	u4359	m289	NICKY	Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
L121481	u4349	m289	GINGER	He hates my fuckin' guts.
L121480	u4349	m289	GINGER	Exactly.  He hates me.
L121479	u4359	m289	NICKY	He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
L121478	u4349	m289	GINGER	No, he's not.
L121475	u4359	m289	NICKY	Everything went to his head. 
L121474	u4349	m289	GINGER	Sure did.
L121473	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
L121472	u4349	m289	GINGER	'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
L121471	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yes, you did.
L121470	u4349	m289	GINGER	I did what you told me to.
L121469	u4359	m289	NICKY	You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
L121468	u4349	m289	GINGER	Exactly.
L121467	u4359	m289	NICKY	You did. You're right.
L121466	u4349	m289	GINGER	I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
L121465	u4359	m289	NICKY	No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
L121464	u4349	m289	GINGER	He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
L121463	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
L121462	u4349	m289	GINGER	He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
L121461	u4359	m289	NICKY	Hm.
L121460	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
L121459	u4359	m289	NICKY	You know?
L121458	u4349	m289	GINGER	Mm-hm.
L121457	u4359	m289	NICKY	See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
L121456	u4349	m289	GINGER	Okay.
L121455	u4359	m289	NICKY	Let me think about that.
L121454	u4349	m289	GINGER	Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
L121453	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.
L121452	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah?
L121451	u4359	m289	NICKY	Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
L121450	u4349	m289	GINGER	I don't - 
L121449	u4359	m289	NICKY	What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
L121448	u4349	m289	GINGER	Nothin'.
L121447	u4359	m289	NICKY	What? What?
L121446	u4349	m289	GINGER	Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
L121445	u4359	m289	NICKY	I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
L121317	u4349	m289	GINGER	Bye.
L121316	u4359	m289	NICKY	And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
L121315	u4359	m289	NICKY	I'll be there.
L121314	u4349	m289	GINGER	So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
L121313	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
L121312	u4359	m289	NICKY	You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
L121311	u4349	m289	GINGER	No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
L121310	u4359	m289	NICKY	You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
L120642	u4359	m289	NICKY	It's all right.
L120641	u4349	m289	GINGER	Thank you.
L120640	u4359	m289	NICKY	Yeah.
L120639	u4349	m289	GINGER	Thanks.
L120638	u4359	m289	NICKY	Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
L120637	u4349	m289	GINGER	You're so nice. 
L120636	u4359	m289	NICKY	You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
L120635	u4349	m289	GINGER	Oh, come on.
L120634	u4359	m289	NICKY	And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
L120632	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah.  Thanks.
L120631	u4359	m289	NICKY	All right?
L120630	u4349	m289	GINGER	Okay.
L120629	u4359	m289	NICKY	Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
L120628	u4349	m289	GINGER	He gives a fuck what I do?
L120627	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
L120626	u4349	m289	GINGER	He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
L120625	u4349	m289	GINGER	He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
L120624	u4359	m289	NICKY	I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
L120623	u4349	m289	GINGER	I do.
L120622	u4359	m289	NICKY	Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
L120621	u4359	m289	NICKY	I know what you mean.
L120620	u4349	m289	GINGER	I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
L120619	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
L120618	u4349	m289	GINGER	I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
L120617	u4359	m289	NICKY	No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
L120616	u4349	m289	GINGER	Mm, you want to steal it? 
L120615	u4359	m289	NICKY	You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
L120614	u4349	m289	GINGER	So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
L120613	u4359	m289	NICKY	I can see that. Sure.
L120612	u4349	m289	GINGER	Am I right?
L120611	u4359	m289	NICKY	Sure.
L120610	u4349	m289	GINGER	Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
L120609	u4359	m289	NICKY	I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
L120608	u4359	m289	NICKY	You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
L120607	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
L120606	u4359	m289	NICKY	Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
L120605	u4349	m289	GINGER	No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
L120604	u4359	m289	NICKY	Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
L120603	u4349	m289	GINGER	Yeah, no shit.
L120602	u4359	m289	NICKY	I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
L120601	u4349	m289	GINGER	Tell me.
L119895	u4359	m289	NICKY	Okay, Sammy.
L119894	u4349	m289	GINGER	Hi, how are you?
L119893	u4359	m289	NICKY	Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
L119892	u4349	m289	GINGER	Hi, Jennifer.

L121124	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Well, you know...
L121123	u4349	m289	GINGER	You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
L121122	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Great.
L120314	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
L120313	u4349	m289	GINGER	I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
L120312	u4353	m289	JENNIFER	So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
L119780	u4351	m289	HIGH ROLLER	Come on! 
L119779	u4349	m289	GINGER	Well, how 'bout that?
L119778	u4351	m289	HIGH ROLLER	Yes.
L119777	u4349	m289	GINGER	Get lost?

L119774	u4351	m289	HIGH ROLLER	Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
L119773	u4349	m289	GINGER	What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
L119772	u4351	m289	HIGH ROLLER	That bag's full of fuckin' chips you

L119769	u4349	m289	GINGER	What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
L119768	u4351	m289	HIGH ROLLER	What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
L119767	u4349	m289	GINGER	What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
L119766	u4351	m289	HIGH ROLLER	What's the matter?
L119765	u4349	m289	GINGER	Come on.

L120917	u4359	m289	NICKY	But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
L120916	u4359	m289	NICKY	...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
L120496	u4359	m289	NICKY	But he never talked.
L120495	u4358	m289	MARINO	Yeah, thanks a lot.
L120482	u4359	m289	NICKY	...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...

L120476	u4359	m289	NICKY	I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
L120472	u4358	m289	MARINO	Remo.

L120379	u4359	m289	NICKY	I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
L120374	u4358	m289	MARINO	What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
L120373	u4359	m289	NICKY	Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
L120333	u4358	m289	MARINO	This peter's a motherfucker.
L120332	u4359	m289	NICKY	What's takin' so long over there?
L120331	u4359	m289	NICKY	Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
L120210	u4359	m289	NICKY	You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.

L175322	u4938	m329	CRISWELL	Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
L175315	u4938	m329	CRISWELL	Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!

L175792	u4934	m329	BELA	Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
L175791	u4941	m329	ED	Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
L175790	u4934	m329	BELA	Oh.  So what is the scene about?
L175789	u4941	m329	ED	No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.

L175777	u4941	m329	ED	I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
L175762	u4934	m329	BELA	Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
L175761	u4941	m329	ED	Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.

L175759	u4941	m329	ED	What happened?!
L175735	u4941	m329	ED	Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.

L175729	u4934	m329	BELA	It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
L175728	u4941	m329	ED	Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
L175727	u4934	m329	BELA	I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
L175726	u4941	m329	ED	Don't you have any savings?
L175725	u4934	m329	BELA	Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
L175724	u4941	m329	ED	Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
L175723	u4934	m329	BELA	I was thinking about killing myself.
L175722	u4941	m329	ED	What are you doing?
L175721	u4941	m329	ED	Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?

L175719	u4941	m329	ED	Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
L175718	u4934	m329	BELA	Why are you here??

L175608	u4934	m329	BELA	Eddie, this is quite a scene.
L175607	u4941	m329	ED	I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
L175606	u4934	m329	BELA	Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
L175605	u4941	m329	ED	No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
L175604	u4934	m329	BELA	That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
L175603	u4941	m329	ED	Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.

L175594	u4934	m329	BELA	"After I did ""Dracula,"" the studio offered me ""Frankenstein""!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me."
L175593	u4941	m329	ED	Huh?
L175592	u4934	m329	BELA	"Do you know I turned down ""Frankenstein""?"
L175591	u4941	m329	ED	Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
L175590	u4934	m329	BELA	Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
L175589	u4934	m329	BELA	Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.

L175575	u4934	m329	BELA	Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
L175503	u4934	m329	BELA	Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
L175502	u4941	m329	ED	But maybe not.
L175501	u4934	m329	BELA	I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
L175500	u4941	m329	ED	So why didn't you do it?
L175499	u4934	m329	BELA	It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
L175498	u4941	m329	ED	Really?
L175497	u4934	m329	BELA	In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
L175496	u4941	m329	ED	Yeah, I did.
L175495	u4934	m329	BELA	Eddie, you screwed up.
L175494	u4941	m329	ED	But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
L175493	u4934	m329	BELA	Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
L175492	u4941	m329	ED	Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
L175488	u4934	m329	BELA	This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.

L175310	u4941	m329	ED	Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
L175294	u4934	m329	BELA	Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!

L174960	u4934	m329	BELA	Thank you.
L174959	u4941	m329	ED	I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.

L175328	u4938	m329	CRISWELL	There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.

L175751	u4939	m329	DOCTOR	Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.

L175539	u4941	m329	ED	Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.

L175475	u4940	m329	DOLORES	That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?

L175383	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
L175382	u4941	m329	ED	It was the only way I could get the movie made!
L175362	u4940	m329	DOLORES	"All I know is, ever since ""Glen Or Glenda,"" all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!"

L175357	u4941	m329	ED	"Tell him ""Bride"" is in pre- production."
L175356	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
L175284	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
L175283	u4941	m329	ED	All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
L175282	u4940	m329	DOLORES	That's ridiculous.
L175281	u4941	m329	ED	Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
L175280	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
L175279	u4941	m329	ED	I'm no good.
L175171	u4941	m329	ED	Exactly.
L175170	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Toss us out on our ass.
L175169	u4941	m329	ED	Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
L175168	u4941	m329	ED	But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
L175167	u4940	m329	DOLORES	But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
L175166	u4941	m329	ED	Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.

L175164	u4941	m329	ED	From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.

L175154	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
L175138	u4941	m329	ED	Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
L175137	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
L175136	u4941	m329	ED	Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.

L175075	u4940	m329	DOLORES	Oh, just like in the script!

So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
L175461	u4955	m329	VAMPIRA	You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --

L175416	u4950	m329	PAUL MARCO	We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
L175415	u4941	m329	ED	Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?

L174894	u4941	m329	ED	So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
L174893	u4950	m329	PAUL MARCO	Lines around the block.
L174892	u4941	m329	ED	"Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last ""Francis the Mule"" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit."

L189911	u5069	m336	BAUM	Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
L189909	u5069	m336	BAUM	250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
L189908	u5074	m336	ED	Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
L189907	u5069	m336	BAUM	A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
L189904	u5074	m336	ED	You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
L189903	u5069	m336	BAUM	I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
L189902	u5074	m336	ED	What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
L189901	u5069	m336	BAUM	In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
L189900	u5074	m336	ED	250,000?
L189875	u5074	m336	ED	All of them.
L189874	u5070	m336	BRENDA	All of 'em?
L189873	u5074	m336	ED	Fax these to this number, okay?
L189547	u5070	m336	BRENDA	Who?
L189546	u5074	m336	ED	What's she doing here?
L189545	u5070	m336	BRENDA	Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
L189544	u5074	m336	ED	I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
L189543	u5070	m336	BRENDA	It's those files you asked for.
L189542	u5074	m336	ED	What the hell is this doing here?
L189481	u5070	m336	BRENDA	Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
L189480	u5074	m336	ED	You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
L189479	u5070	m336	BRENDA	Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
L189478	u5074	m336	ED	Whoa.  Remind me.
L189477	u5070	m336	BRENDA	He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
L189476	u5074	m336	ED	Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
L189475	u5070	m336	BRENDA	Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
L189474	u5074	m336	ED	What do you think?  What's this?
L189473	u5070	m336	BRENDA	His dry cleaners.  You want him?
L189472	u5074	m336	ED	Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
L189471	u5070	m336	BRENDA	Tony Marvin.
L189506	u5076	m336	ERIN	That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
L189505	u5071	m336	DEFENDING LAWYER	An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
L189504	u5076	m336	ERIN	He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
L189503	u5071	m336	DEFENDING LAWYER	So you say.
L189502	u5076	m336	ERIN	What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
L189500	u5076	m336	ERIN	What's your point?
L189499	u5071	m336	DEFENDING LAWYER	So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
L189496	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
L189495	u5071	m336	DEFENDING LAWYER	There's more than one?
L189494	u5076	m336	ERIN	Which one?
L189493	u5071	m336	DEFENDING LAWYER	Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
L190352	u5078	m336	GEORGE	... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
L190351	u5072	m336	DOCTOR	Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
L190350	u5078	m336	GEORGE	How does someone get meningitis?
L190349	u5072	m336	DOCTOR	She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
L190348	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Jesus.
L190347	u5072	m336	DOCTOR	It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
L190346	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
L190509	u5073	m336	DONNA	Oh my God.  Oh my God.
L190508	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yup.
L190507	u5073	m336	DONNA	And get someone to help around the house.
L190506	u5076	m336	ERIN	Any school you want.
L190505	u5073	m336	DONNA	I can put them in a good school.
L190504	u5076	m336	ERIN	It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
L190503	u5073	m336	DONNA	I don't even know how much money that is.
L190502	u5076	m336	ERIN	Five million dollars.
L190501	u5073	m336	DONNA	Five million dollars?
L190500	u5076	m336	ERIN	And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
L190499	u5073	m336	DONNA	Oh, my God.
L190497	u5076	m336	ERIN	Both.
L190496	u5073	m336	DONNA	A number for the whole group, or for us?
L190495	u5076	m336	ERIN	The judge came up with a number.
L190494	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
L190493	u5073	m336	DONNA	It's a good day.  I feel good.
L190430	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
L190429	u5073	m336	DONNA	For what?
L190428	u5076	m336	ERIN	You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
L190146	u5076	m336	ERIN	Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
L190145	u5073	m336	DONNA	Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
L189883	u5076	m336	ERIN	Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
L189882	u5073	m336	DONNA	No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
L189881	u5076	m336	ERIN	I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
L189880	u5073	m336	DONNA	Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
L189879	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah.
L189878	u5073	m336	DONNA	And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
L189877	u5076	m336	ERIN	It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
L189876	u5073	m336	DONNA	An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
L189712	u5073	m336	DONNA	Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
L189711	u5076	m336	ERIN	Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
L189709	u5073	m336	DONNA	I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
L189708	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
L189707	u5073	m336	DONNA	It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
L189706	u5076	m336	ERIN	What's chromium?
L189704	u5073	m336	DONNA	The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
L189703	u5076	m336	ERIN	The what?
L189702	u5073	m336	DONNA	Cause of the chromium.
L189701	u5076	m336	ERIN	Wow.  Why would they do that?
L189700	u5073	m336	DONNA	You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
L189699	u5076	m336	ERIN	They did?
L189698	u5073	m336	DONNA	Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
L189697	u5076	m336	ERIN	Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
L189696	u5073	m336	DONNA	Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
L189695	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
L189694	u5073	m336	DONNA	So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
L189693	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'll say.  Holy moley.
L189692	u5073	m336	DONNA	Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
L189691	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
L189690	u5073	m336	DONNA	I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
L189689	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
L189688	u5073	m336	DONNA	Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
L189687	u5076	m336	ERIN	Right.
L189686	u5073	m336	DONNA	Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
L189685	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
L189684	u5073	m336	DONNA	I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
L189683	u5073	m336	DONNA	Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
L189682	u5076	m336	ERIN	This is a real nice place you got here.
L189681	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
L189680	u5073	m336	DONNA	You're a lawyer?
L189679	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
L189678	u5073	m336	DONNA	Yes?
L189677	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hi.  Donna Irving?
L190527	u5074	m336	ED	The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
L190526	u5076	m336	ERIN	Two million dollars?
L190525	u5074	m336	ED	Take it.
L190524	u5076	m336	ERIN	What is that?
L190523	u5074	m336	ED	Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
L190522	u5076	m336	ERIN	Ed, I swear, I'm not --
L190521	u5074	m336	ED	I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ...
L190520	u5076	m336	ERIN	I wasn't gonna --
L190519	u5074	m336	ED	The extortion, the threats ...
L190518	u5076	m336	ERIN	Here what comes?
L190517	u5074	m336	ED	Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
L190516	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
L190515	u5074	m336	ED	You see your office?
L190514	u5076	m336	ERIN	Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
L190491	u5074	m336	ED	Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
L190490	u5076	m336	ERIN	How do you know that?
L190489	u5074	m336	ED	But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
L190488	u5074	m336	ED	The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
L190487	u5076	m336	ERIN	Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
L190486	u5074	m336	ED	I did.  Both.
L190485	u5076	m336	ERIN	Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
L190484	u5074	m336	ED	I was wrong.
L190483	u5076	m336	ERIN	Say you were wrong.
L190482	u5074	m336	ED	I don't know what to say.
L190477	u5076	m336	ERIN	Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
L190476	u5074	m336	ED	Ho - ly - shit.
L190474	u5076	m336	ERIN	You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
L190473	u5074	m336	ED	Erin?  What are you --
L190472	u5076	m336	ERIN	Morning!
L190385	u5076	m336	ERIN	No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
L190384	u5074	m336	ED	Erin --
L190383	u5076	m336	ERIN	Fuck Kurt.
L190382	u5074	m336	ED	Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
L190381	u5076	m336	ERIN	Why not?
L190380	u5074	m336	ED	This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
L190379	u5076	m336	ERIN	The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
L190378	u5074	m336	ED	You're not gonna be there.
L190377	u5076	m336	ERIN	Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
L190376	u5074	m336	ED	Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
L190375	u5076	m336	ERIN	When?  Where?
L190374	u5074	m336	ED	<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
L190373	u5076	m336	ERIN	Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
L190372	u5074	m336	ED	Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
L190371	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
L190370	u5074	m336	ED	Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
L190369	u5076	m336	ERIN	Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
L190368	u5074	m336	ED	Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
L190367	u5076	m336	ERIN	So why would PG&E offer it?
L190366	u5074	m336	ED	With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
L190365	u5076	m336	ERIN	And if you had to guess ...
L190364	u5074	m336	ED	Uh-huh.
L190363	u5076	m336	ERIN	Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
L190362	u5076	m336	ERIN	I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
L190361	u5074	m336	ED	I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
L190360	u5076	m336	ERIN	If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
L190332	u5076	m336	ERIN	Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
L190331	u5074	m336	ED	Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
L190330	u5076	m336	ERIN	Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
L190329	u5074	m336	ED	No one's taking anything --
L190328	u5076	m336	ERIN	How dare you take that away from me.
L190327	u5076	m336	ERIN	<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
L190326	u5074	m336	ED	Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
L190325	u5076	m336	ERIN	"Fun?  Jesus, ""<u>fun</u>?""  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as ""fun?"""
L190324	u5074	m336	ED	You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
L190323	u5076	m336	ERIN	And, what, I'm not serious?
L190322	u5074	m336	ED	Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
L190321	u5076	m336	ERIN	Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
L190320	u5074	m336	ED	Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
L190319	u5076	m336	ERIN	Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
L190318	u5074	m336	ED	Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.

L190258	u5076	m336	ERIN	What's a demur?
L190249	u5074	m336	ED	Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

L190244	u5074	m336	ED	It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
L190243	u5076	m336	ERIN	Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
L190242	u5074	m336	ED	Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
L190241	u5076	m336	ERIN	Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
L190240	u5074	m336	ED	And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
L190239	u5076	m336	ERIN	... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
L190238	u5074	m336	ED	I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...

L190222	u5076	m336	ERIN	You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
L190221	u5074	m336	ED	I'll see what I can do.

L190217	u5074	m336	ED	Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
L190216	u5076	m336	ERIN	It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

L190113	u5074	m336	ED	I like this case.
L190112	u5076	m336	ERIN	Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
L190111	u5074	m336	ED	Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.

L190105	u5076	m336	ERIN	Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
L190104	u5074	m336	ED	Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
L190103	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
L190102	u5074	m336	ED	Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.

L190098	u5074	m336	ED	No shit.
L190097	u5076	m336	ERIN	For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.

L190095	u5076	m336	ERIN	I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
L190094	u5074	m336	ED	They skipped that step.
L190093	u5076	m336	ERIN	See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
L190092	u5076	m336	ERIN	It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
L190091	u5074	m336	ED	And that's what caused the contamination?
L190090	u5076	m336	ERIN	They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
L190089	u5074	m336	ED	I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
L190088	u5076	m336	ERIN	They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.

L190065	u5076	m336	ERIN	She lived on the plume.  You never know.
L190064	u5074	m336	ED	Is that what I think it is?
L190020	u5076	m336	ERIN	Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
L190019	u5074	m336	ED	What now?
L190017	u5074	m336	ED	Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
L190016	u5076	m336	ERIN	You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
L190015	u5074	m336	ED	Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
L190014	u5076	m336	ERIN	Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
L190013	u5074	m336	ED	This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
L190012	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
L190011	u5074	m336	ED	You think there's more?
L190010	u5076	m336	ERIN	Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
L190009	u5074	m336	ED	How many families we talking about here?

L190004	u5076	m336	ERIN	We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
L190003	u5074	m336	ED	I know how DNA works, Erin --
L190002	u5076	m336	ERIN	And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
L190001	u5076	m336	ERIN	-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
L190000	u5074	m336	ED	-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
L189999	u5076	m336	ERIN	Bullshit.
L189998	u5074	m336	ED	It's not about working hard --
L189997	u5076	m336	ERIN	Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
L189996	u5074	m336	ED	Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you.
L189995	u5076	m336	ERIN	That's crazy -- why not?
L189994	u5074	m336	ED	Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
L189971	u5076	m336	ERIN	And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
L189970	u5074	m336	ED	Then I don't get anything either.
L189968	u5074	m336	ED	Erin --
L189967	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
L189966	u5074	m336	ED	Erin --
L189965	u5076	m336	ERIN	Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?

L189922	u5076	m336	ERIN	Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.

L189917	u5076	m336	ERIN	And you can't?
L189916	u5074	m336	ED	Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
L189915	u5076	m336	ERIN	I don't get why they'd do that.
L189914	u5074	m336	ED	That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
L189913	u5076	m336	ERIN	At least they made an offer.
L189895	u5074	m336	ED	It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
L189894	u5076	m336	ERIN	So you think we got 'em scared?

L189852	u5074	m336	ED	A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
L189851	u5076	m336	ERIN	Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
L189850	u5074	m336	ED	Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
L189849	u5074	m336	ED	Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.

L189846	u5076	m336	ERIN	Course I did.

L189843	u5074	m336	ED	I didn't see any medical records in there.
L189842	u5076	m336	ERIN	The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
L189841	u5074	m336	ED	What medical records?
L189840	u5076	m336	ERIN	It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
L189839	u5074	m336	ED	So what made you think it was?
L189838	u5076	m336	ERIN	They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
L189837	u5074	m336	ED	But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
L189835	u5076	m336	ERIN	You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.

L189829	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
L189828	u5074	m336	ED	He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.

L189557	u5076	m336	ERIN	I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.

L189513	u5076	m336	ERIN	<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
L189512	u5074	m336	ED	Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
L189511	u5076	m336	ERIN	Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
L189510	u5074	m336	ED	I told you the questions might get a little personal --
L189509	u5076	m336	ERIN	Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
L189508	u5074	m336	ED	If you hadn't used profanity --
L189507	u5076	m336	ERIN	Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
L189492	u5074	m336	ED	Yeah.  I know.
L189491	u5076	m336	ERIN	... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
L189490	u5076	m336	ERIN	... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
L189489	u5076	m336	ERIN	... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
L189488	u5076	m336	ERIN	They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
L190295	u5086	m336	POTTER	I think we should makes some changes.
L190294	u5074	m336	ED	Right.
L190293	u5086	m336	POTTER	I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
L190266	u5086	m336	POTTER	Good.
L190265	u5074	m336	ED	Corey.
L190264	u5086	m336	POTTER	Who's the judge?
L190261	u5074	m336	ED	Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
L190260	u5086	m336	POTTER	How many counts?
L190257	u5074	m336	ED	Yesterday.
L190256	u5086	m336	POTTER	When'd they file the demur?
L190469	u5075	m336	EMBRY	At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
L190468	u5076	m336	ERIN	How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
L190467	u5075	m336	EMBRY	Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead.
L190466	u5076	m336	ERIN	What do you mean?
L190465	u5075	m336	EMBRY	Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
L190464	u5075	m336	EMBRY	That's right.
L190463	u5076	m336	ERIN	And you were told to destroy those?
L190462	u5075	m336	EMBRY	There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like.  But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
L190461	u5076	m336	ERIN	And ...?
L190460	u5075	m336	EMBRY	Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
L190459	u5076	m336	ERIN	Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
L190458	u5075	m336	EMBRY	Nope.  And I didn't ask.
L190457	u5076	m336	ERIN	Did he say why?
L190456	u5075	m336	EMBRY	I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
L190055	u5076	m336	ERIN	The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
L190054	u5088	m336	ROSS	I don't know what you're talking about.
L190053	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
L189872	u5076	m336	ERIN	Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
L189871	u5088	m336	ROSS	You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
L189761	u5076	m336	ERIN	Not anymore.
L189760	u5088	m336	ROSS	You're married.
L189759	u5076	m336	ERIN	Nope.  Maiden.
L189758	u5088	m336	ROSS	Pattee?  That your middle name?
L189757	u5088	m336	ROSS	Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
L189756	u5076	m336	ERIN	I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
L189755	u5088	m336	ROSS	You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
L189754	u5076	m336	ERIN	I guess I did.
L189753	u5088	m336	ROSS	You come to the right place.
L189752	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
L189751	u5088	m336	ROSS	Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
L189750	u5076	m336	ERIN	Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
L189749	u5088	m336	ROSS	Ross.
L189748	u5076	m336	ERIN	Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
L189747	u5088	m336	ROSS	Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
L189744	u5077	m336	FRANKEL	Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
L189743	u5076	m336	ERIN	County water board.  All righty, thanks.
L189742	u5077	m336	FRANKEL	Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
L189741	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hunh-uh.  What's that?
L189740	u5077	m336	FRANKEL	Have you been to the water board?
L189739	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
L189738	u5077	m336	FRANKEL	Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
L189737	u5076	m336	ERIN	So that stuff -- it kills people.
L189736	u5077	m336	FRANKEL	With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
L189735	u5076	m336	ERIN	Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
L189734	u5077	m336	FRANKEL	Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
L189733	u5076	m336	ERIN	There's more than one kind?
L189732	u5077	m336	FRANKEL	What kind of chromium is it?
L190186	u5076	m336	ERIN	George!
L190185	u5080	m336	KATIE	I don't know.
L190184	u5076	m336	ERIN	What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
L189948	u5076	m336	ERIN	That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
L189947	u5080	m336	KATIE	It happens all the time.
L189946	u5076	m336	ERIN	Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
L189865	u5076	m336	ERIN	Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
L189864	u5080	m336	KATIE	Yeah.  A real moron.
L189861	u5080	m336	KATIE	I'm gonna hate it.
L189860	u5076	m336	ERIN	Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
L189859	u5080	m336	KATIE	I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
L189578	u5076	m336	ERIN	Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
L189577	u5080	m336	KATIE	Mommy, can I get a flower?
L189531	u5080	m336	KATIE	How come you're not eating?
L189530	u5076	m336	ERIN	Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
L190513	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
L190512	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
L190471	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	In the conference --
L190470	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hey, Ros, where are they?
L190308	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
L190307	u5076	m336	ERIN	PG& -- Are you sure?
L190306	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
L190305	u5076	m336	ERIN	What's going on in there?
L190304	u5076	m336	ERIN	So did I.
L190303	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
L189927	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	Hey, just so long as you see Him.
L189926	u5076	m336	ERIN	"I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word ""dog"" and see ""god""."
L189925	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	You've been reading for hours.
L189659	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
L189658	u5087	m336	ROSALIND	Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
L190443	u5076	m336	ERIN	Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
L190442	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	How come her own mom isn't helping her?
L190441	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
L190440	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	She's one of the sick people?
L190344	u5076	m336	ERIN	Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
L190343	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
L190342	u5076	m336	ERIN	I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
L190341	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
L190340	u5076	m336	ERIN	We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
L190338	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	I'm gonna go live with George.
L190337	u5076	m336	ERIN	God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
L190227	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
L190226	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	Randy's mom said yes right away.
L190225	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	When?
L190224	u5076	m336	ERIN	We'll see.
L190223	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	Can I play roller hockey?
L189867	u5076	m336	ERIN	Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
L189866	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	Yeah.
L189858	u5083	m336	MATTHEW	Well I hate it.
L189857	u5076	m336	ERIN	There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
L190285	u5076	m336	ERIN	That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
L190284	u5089	m336	THERESA	Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
L190282	u5076	m336	ERIN	Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
L190281	u5089	m336	THERESA	Annabelle Daniels.
L190280	u5089	m336	THERESA	You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
L190279	u5076	m336	ERIN	I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
L190278	u5089	m336	THERESA	Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
L190277	u5076	m336	ERIN	Whose number do you need?
L190276	u5089	m336	THERESA	Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
L190275	u5076	m336	ERIN	Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
L190274	u5089	m336	THERESA	No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
L190273	u5076	m336	ERIN	Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
L190272	u5089	m336	THERESA	Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
L190271	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hey -- those are my files --
L190450	u5076	m336	ERIN	I will.  Bye.
L190449	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
L190435	u5078	m336	GEORGE	We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
L190434	u5076	m336	ERIN	No, I need my car --
L190433	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
L190432	u5076	m336	ERIN	What time is it?
L190424	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
L190423	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
L190422	u5076	m336	ERIN	You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
L190421	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Think you could learn?
L190418	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
L190417	u5076	m336	ERIN	And I miss you.
L190416	u5076	m336	ERIN	I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
L190415	u5078	m336	GEORGE	How long's this whole thing gonna take?
L190414	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
L190413	u5078	m336	GEORGE	They up?
L190411	u5076	m336	ERIN	It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
L190410	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I don't do favors for you anymore.
L190409	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
L190408	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Hello?
L190357	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Mm-hm.
L190356	u5076	m336	ERIN	Thank you.
L190355	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
L190354	u5076	m336	ERIN	They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
L190203	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
L190202	u5076	m336	ERIN	You already packed up your stuff?
L190200	u5076	m336	ERIN	I need it.
L190199	u5078	m336	GEORGE	More than you need me.
L190198	u5076	m336	ERIN	I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
L190197	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
L190196	u5076	m336	ERIN	I can't leave my job, George.
L190195	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
L190194	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
L190193	u5078	m336	GEORGE	It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
L190192	u5076	m336	ERIN	What's that?
L190191	u5078	m336	GEORGE	About this.
L190190	u5076	m336	ERIN	About what?
L190189	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Thinking.
L190188	u5076	m336	ERIN	What's going on?  What are you doing?
L190141	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
L190140	u5076	m336	ERIN	That is not what I'm --
L190139	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
L190138	u5076	m336	ERIN	What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
L190137	u5078	m336	GEORGE	It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
L190132	u5076	m336	ERIN	No, I wanna say hi.
L190131	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Lock the door.
L190130	u5076	m336	ERIN	That's Ed.
L190122	u5076	m336	ERIN	Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
L190121	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
L190069	u5076	m336	ERIN	Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
L190068	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I'm bored, and so are the kids.
L190062	u5078	m336	GEORGE	"Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, ""ball."""
L190061	u5076	m336	ERIN	What?  Beth?  My Beth?
L190060	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
L190059	u5076	m336	ERIN	No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
L190058	u5078	m336	GEORGE	What do you want, a joke?
L190057	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
L190052	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.
L190051	u5076	m336	ERIN	Keep your voice down.
L190050	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
L190049	u5076	m336	ERIN	I didn't say that.
L190048	u5078	m336	GEORGE	If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
L190047	u5076	m336	ERIN	Nothing.
L190046	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
L190045	u5076	m336	ERIN	How would you know?
L190044	u5078	m336	GEORGE	It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
L190043	u5076	m336	ERIN	No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
L190042	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
L190041	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
L190040	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
L190039	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
L190027	u5076	m336	ERIN	I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
L190026	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I'm just saying --
L190025	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
L190024	u5078	m336	GEORGE	One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
L190023	u5076	m336	ERIN	George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
L189818	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
L189817	u5076	m336	ERIN	No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
L189816	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You are someone.
L189815	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
L189814	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You're not nothing, Erin.
L189813	u5076	m336	ERIN	Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
L189812	u5078	m336	GEORGE	What?  But you been working so hard --
L189811	u5076	m336	ERIN	I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
L189810	u5078	m336	GEORGE	It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
L189809	u5076	m336	ERIN	What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
L189799	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I'm gonna clean it up.
L189798	u5076	m336	ERIN	Great.
L189796	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Fixing a leak under your sink.
L189795	u5076	m336	ERIN	What are you doing here?
L189720	u5078	m336	GEORGE	What do you mean?
L189719	u5076	m336	ERIN	You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
L189718	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
L189717	u5076	m336	ERIN	Thanks for reminding me.
L189716	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
L189714	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Better safe than sorry.
L189713	u5076	m336	ERIN	What're you doing?
L189654	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
L189653	u5076	m336	ERIN	This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
L189652	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
L189651	u5076	m336	ERIN	You're around every afternoon?
L189649	u5076	m336	ERIN	Right.
L189648	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
L189647	u5076	m336	ERIN	Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
L189646	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
L189645	u5076	m336	ERIN	It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
L189644	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
L189643	u5076	m336	ERIN	I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
L189642	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
L189641	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
L189640	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
L189639	u5076	m336	ERIN	Great.  Another deadbeat.
L189638	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
L189637	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
L189636	u5078	m336	GEORGE	How?
L189635	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
L189627	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Yeah, and whose fault is that?
L189626	u5076	m336	ERIN	Cause I don't even know you.
L189625	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Why not?
L189624	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
L189623	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
L189622	u5076	m336	ERIN	I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
L189620	u5076	m336	ERIN	Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
L189619	u5078	m336	GEORGE	C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
L189618	u5076	m336	ERIN	No.
L189597	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
L189596	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You got a little girl?
L189595	u5076	m336	ERIN	Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
L189594	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Ten?
L189593	u5076	m336	ERIN	Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
L189592	u5078	m336	GEORGE	You got more than one?
L189591	u5076	m336	ERIN	Which number do you want, George?
L189590	u5078	m336	GEORGE	I do.
L189589	u5076	m336	ERIN	You want my number?
L189587	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
L189586	u5076	m336	ERIN	Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
L189585	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
L189584	u5076	m336	ERIN	Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
L189583	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
L189582	u5076	m336	ERIN	What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
L189581	u5078	m336	GEORGE	Well, hello to you, darlin'.
L190086	u5076	m336	ERIN	A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
L190085	u5081	m336	LAURA	I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
L190084	u5076	m336	ERIN	Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
L190083	u5081	m336	LAURA	Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
L190082	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm real sorry, Laura.
L190081	u5081	m336	LAURA	It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
L190080	u5076	m336	ERIN	That's okay.  I understand.
L190079	u5081	m336	LAURA	I'm embarrassed.
L190210	u5079	m336	JANE	You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
L190209	u5076	m336	ERIN	Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
L190208	u5079	m336	JANE	I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
L190207	u5076	m336	ERIN	What?
L190206	u5079	m336	JANE	Have you been logging on?
L190205	u5076	m336	ERIN	Where's my paycheck?
L189788	u5079	m336	JANE	<u>Excuse me</u>?
L189787	u5076	m336	ERIN	I am not talking to you, bitch.
L189786	u5079	m336	JANE	Yes.  It's called accountability.
L189785	u5076	m336	ERIN	What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
L189779	u5079	m336	JANE	There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
L189778	u5076	m336	ERIN	What's going on?
L189777	u5079	m336	JANE	-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
L189776	u5076	m336	ERIN	I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
L189775	u5079	m336	JANE	Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
L189774	u5076	m336	ERIN	Someone stole my stuff.
L189657	u5079	m336	JANE	What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
L189656	u5076	m336	ERIN	I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
L189978	u5082	m336	MANDY	Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
L189977	u5076	m336	ERIN	Uh-huh?
L189976	u5082	m336	MANDY	You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
L189941	u5076	m336	ERIN	I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
L189940	u5082	m336	MANDY	I know.  It's an awful lot.
L189937	u5076	m336	ERIN	What?
L189936	u5082	m336	MANDY	There's something else, too.
L189935	u5076	m336	ERIN	It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
L189934	u5082	m336	MANDY	When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
L189929	u5076	m336	ERIN	Yeah.  Who are you?
L189928	u5082	m336	MANDY	Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
L189526	u5084	m336	MRS. MORALES	I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
L189525	u5076	m336	ERIN	Wow, that's soon --
L189524	u5084	m336	MRS. MORALES	Next week.
L189523	u5076	m336	ERIN	You're moving away?  When?
L189522	u5084	m336	MRS. MORALES	My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
L189521	u5076	m336	ERIN	What?
L189520	u5084	m336	MRS. MORALES	Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
L189519	u5076	m336	ERIN	It'll be fine, yeah.
L189518	u5084	m336	MRS. MORALES	Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
L189517	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
L189731	u5076	m336	ERIN	Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
L189730	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
L189729	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
L189728	u5076	m336	ERIN	Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
L189727	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	You did?
L189726	u5076	m336	ERIN	... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
L189674	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
L189673	u5076	m336	ERIN	Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
L189672	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
L189671	u5076	m336	ERIN	Right, I guess those are the kids --
L189670	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
L189669	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
L189668	u5076	m336	ERIN	No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
L189667	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	Oh.  Oh.
L189665	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
L189664	u5076	m336	ERIN	Who's Baxter?
L189663	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
L189662	u5076	m336	ERIN	Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
L189661	u5085	m336	PAULSEN	Yes?
L189660	u5076	m336	ERIN	Dr. Paulsen?
L231299	u5463	m364	BA	I will follow you in all our vows and duties.
L231298	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life.
L231297	u5463	m364	BA	I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people.
L231296	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people.
L231200	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Eleven.
L231199	u5463	m364	BA	God gave you ten thumbs.
L230911	u5467	m364	GANDHI	There's no room! And the air is lovely.
L230910	u5463	m364	BA	Please! You're being foolish!
L230760	u5467	m364	GANDHI	All the more reason.
L230759	u5463	m364	BA	I am your wife.
L230758	u5467	m364	GANDHI	In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
L230757	u5463	m364	BA	It is the work of untouchables.
L230756	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Everyone takes his turn.
L230755	u5463	m364	BA	Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
L230686	u5463	m364	BA	Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
L230685	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Oww!
L230683	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Yes -- I can't talk like this.
L230682	u5463	m364	BA	Are you sure?
L230681	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- ""a monstrous attack."""
L230679	u5463	m364	BA	They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
L230678	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
L230671	u5463	m364	BA	As I told you about English policemen.
L230670	u5467	m364	GANDHI	A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest. -- I told you about English law.
L231568	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
L231567	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	Just an admirer...
L231565	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	One more.
L231564	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Enough.
L231560	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
L231559	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
L231432	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
L231431	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	What do you expect when you talk like that?
L231430	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No. That is what you get for distracting me.
L231429	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
L231428	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
L231427	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
L231423	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
L231422	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	...what shape it will take. Jinnah has -- what?
L231420	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	Stop!
L231419	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
L231021	u5467	m364	GANDHI	It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
L231020	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	"They're calling you ""Bapu."" I thought it meant father."
L231018	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
L231017	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
L231016	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
L231015	u5467	m364	GANDHI	If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
L231012	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Did they take your clothes?
L231011	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"Not quite. They're only ""holding me"" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison."
L230918	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Going nearer to God!
L230917	u5467	m364	GANDHI	What are you doing?
L230913	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
L230912	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	No violence, please.
L230727	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Well, we shall try.
L230726	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	"That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this ""farm""..."
L230724	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
L230723	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I thought you were a man of God.
L230722	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	That was lucky.
L230708	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
L230707	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
L230706	u5467	m364	GANDHI	You're a clergyman.
L230704	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Some of it good, I hope.
L230703	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
L230702	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm sorry.
L230701	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
L231349	u5477	m364	WALKER	He said he's in charge...
L231348	u5466	m364	COLLINS	What'd he say?
L231292	u5466	m364	COLLINS	Well, he must've found some of the answers...
L231291	u5477	m364	WALKER	Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
L231290	u5466	m364	COLLINS	What was he like?
L231289	u5477	m364	WALKER	Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
L231288	u5466	m364	COLLINS	You mean Gandhi?
L231285	u5477	m364	WALKER	Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
L231284	u5466	m364	COLLINS	How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
L231283	u5477	m364	WALKER	...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
L230624	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No, no -- just a moment, please.
L230623	u5474	m364	PORTER	I'll take your luggage back, baas.
L230617	u5474	m364	PORTER	Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
L230616	u5467	m364	GANDHI	A -- a week.
L230615	u5474	m364	PORTER	Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
L230614	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
L230613	u5474	m364	PORTER	Hell!
L230612	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Tell me -- do you think about hell?
L231528	u5467	m364	GANDHI	That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
L231527	u5472	m364	NEHRU	What do you want?
L231400	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
L231399	u5467	m364	GANDHI	They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
L231341	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Wait and see... wait and see...
L231340	u5472	m364	NEHRU	He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
L231339	u5467	m364	GANDHI	And Jinnah?
L231266	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Panditji -- please, help me.
L231265	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
L231239	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
L231238	u5472	m364	NEHRU	It was one incident.
L231237	u5467	m364	GANDHI	If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
L231232	u5467	m364	GANDHI	We must end the campaign.
L231231	u5472	m364	NEHRU	What can we do?
L231115	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I've never spoken for anything else.
L231114	u5472	m364	NEHRU	The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
L231113	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
L231098	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
L231097	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
L230959	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I thought you were against fighting.
L230958	u5467	m364	GANDHI	We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
L231351	u5477	m364	WALKER	My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
L231350	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Are you going to walk all the way?
L231345	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
L231344	u5477	m364	WALKER	Is it over if they arrest you now?
L231343	u5477	m364	WALKER	It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
L231342	u5467	m364	GANDHI	You've done me a great service.
L231313	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
L231312	u5477	m364	WALKER	A great deal.
L231311	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Do you remember much of South Africa?
L231310	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
L231309	u5477	m364	WALKER	Hm.  Is it?
L231308	u5467	m364	GANDHI	And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
L231306	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Even as a boy I thought so.
L231305	u5477	m364	WALKER	It's beautiful.
L230748	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I hope not.
L230747	u5477	m364	WALKER	You're an ambitious man.
L230746	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"That's right. The word only means ""community."" But it could stand for ""village""... or the world."
L230745	u5477	m364	WALKER	"Well, it's quite a place, your ""ashram"" -- is that right?"
L230741	u5467	m364	GANDHI	There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
L230740	u5477	m364	WALKER	You will respect the law.
L230739	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"I don't know... I'm still searching for a ""response."""
L230738	u5477	m364	WALKER	"Hm. And what should an ""important professional"" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?"
L230737	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
L231550	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
L231549	u5467	m364	GANDHI	It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
L231336	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
L231335	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
L231252	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
L231251	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Do you find me stubborn?
L231220	u5467	m364	GANDHI	First spin. Let the others march for a time.
L231219	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	I would rather march.
L231218	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
L231217	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
L231451	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
L231450	u5469	m364	JINNAH	I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
L231234	u5467	m364	GANDHI	An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
L231233	u5469	m364	JINNAH	After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
L231092	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
L231091	u5469	m364	JINNAH	You mean a general strike?
L231070	u5469	m364	JINNAH	I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
L231069	u5467	m364	GANDHI	The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
L230886	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I --
L230885	u5469	m364	JINNAH	We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
L231492	u5467	m364	GANDHI	There is nothing I can give.
L231491	u5473	m364	PATEL	We need your help!
L231403	u5473	m364	PATEL	That's when you take advantage.
L231402	u5467	m364	GANDHI	They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
L231204	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
L231203	u5473	m364	PATEL	It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
L231076	u5473	m364	PATEL	Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
L231075	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
L230878	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No.
L230877	u5473	m364	PATEL	Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
L230876	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
L230875	u5473	m364	PATEL	I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
L230874	u5473	m364	PATEL	That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
L230873	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Who is that young man?
L230819	u5470	m364	KHAN	Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
L230818	u5467	m364	GANDHI	If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
L230817	u5470	m364	KHAN	Well, that's one victory.
L230816	u5467	m364	GANDHI	It's split the Government.
L230815	u5470	m364	KHAN	The fools!  Sorry...
L230814	u5467	m364	GANDHI	My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
L230813	u5470	m364	KHAN	I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
L230811	u5467	m364	GANDHI	So did I.
L230810	u5470	m364	KHAN	No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
L230809	u5467	m364	GANDHI	They're sparing no one, I see.
L230643	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
L230642	u5470	m364	KHAN	Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
L230641	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
L230640	u5470	m364	KHAN	"I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less ""holy"" than Mr. Baker."
L230639	u5467	m364	GANDHI	You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
L230634	u5470	m364	KHAN	That was England.
L230633	u5467	m364	GANDHI	In England, I was a poor student but I --
L230845	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
L230844	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
L230843	u5476	m364	SMUTS	All right. Fine.
L230842	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
L230841	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Assuming we are in agreement?
L230839	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
L230838	u5476	m364	SMUTS	You're an extraordinary man.
L230835	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I congratulate them.
L230834	u5476	m364	SMUTS	"Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to ""investigate"" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed."
L230833	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Very well.
L230832	u5476	m364	SMUTS	I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
L230831	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Somehow I expected not.
L230830	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
L230829	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
L230828	u5476	m364	SMUTS	"Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such ""exception"" to."
L230826	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Ahh.
L230825	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I dined at the prison.
L230824	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Perhaps some tea?
L230823	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Thank you. No.
L230822	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Will you have a glass of sherry?
L231377	u5468	m364	IRWIN	Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
L231376	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
L231375	u5468	m364	IRWIN	He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
L231369	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
L231368	u5468	m364	IRWIN	Who's leading them?
L231367	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
L231327	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	"Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of ""Free India."" Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt."
L231326	u5468	m364	IRWIN	"And that's the basis of this ""Declaration of Independence""?"
L231489	u5472	m364	NEHRU	Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
L231488	u5473	m364	PATEL	Could we cut all news off? I know --
L231485	u5473	m364	PATEL	...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
L231484	u5472	m364	NEHRU	In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
L231480	u5473	m364	PATEL	Have you found him?
L231479	u5472	m364	NEHRU	He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
L231468	u5473	m364	PATEL	If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
L231467	u5472	m364	NEHRU	Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
L230946	u5473	m364	PATEL	No -- but I think I'm going to.
L230945	u5472	m364	NEHRU	Have you read his magazine?
L230908	u5472	m364	NEHRU	"He's ""discovering"" India."
L230907	u5473	m364	PATEL	Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
L246406	u5562	m370	CLAY	Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
L246405	u5561	m370	BETTY	Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
L246404	u5562	m370	CLAY	So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
L246403	u5561	m370	BETTY	Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
L246402	u5562	m370	CLAY	I like my life.  I'm a free man.
L246401	u5561	m370	BETTY	What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
L246400	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm not a kid.
L246399	u5561	m370	BETTY	The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
L246398	u5562	m370	CLAY	You mean us?
L246397	u5561	m370	BETTY	You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
L246396	u5562	m370	CLAY	If you enjoy it, you should do it.
L246395	u5561	m370	BETTY	Sure.  I loved it.
L246394	u5562	m370	CLAY	You liked it too.
L246393	u5561	m370	BETTY	No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
L246392	u5562	m370	CLAY	I didn't mean to...
L246391	u5561	m370	BETTY	It still hurt.  A lot.
L246390	u5562	m370	CLAY	Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
L246389	u5561	m370	BETTY	You picked up that girl right in front of me.
L246387	u5561	m370	BETTY	All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
L246386	u5562	m370	CLAY	He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
L246385	u5561	m370	BETTY	It never crossed your mind?
L246384	u5562	m370	CLAY	It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
L246383	u5561	m370	BETTY	Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
L246382	u5562	m370	CLAY	This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
L246380	u5561	m370	BETTY	Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
L246379	u5562	m370	CLAY	I wasn't going to try anything.
L246378	u5561	m370	BETTY	It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
L246377	u5562	m370	CLAY	What's that mean?
L246375	u5562	m370	CLAY	If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
L246374	u5561	m370	BETTY	Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
L246373	u5562	m370	CLAY	I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
L246372	u5561	m370	BETTY	What's to be jealous of?
L246371	u5562	m370	CLAY	You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
L246363	u5561	m370	BETTY	Weird.
L246362	u5562	m370	CLAY	So what did you think?
L246345	u5561	m370	BETTY	Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
L246344	u5562	m370	CLAY	Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
L246343	u5561	m370	BETTY	These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
L246338	u5562	m370	CLAY	Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
L246337	u5561	m370	BETTY	This looks corny.
L246333	u5562	m370	CLAY	We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
L246332	u5561	m370	BETTY	Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
L246331	u5562	m370	CLAY	Fuck you.
L246330	u5561	m370	BETTY	All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
L246329	u5562	m370	CLAY	Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
L246328	u5561	m370	BETTY	Just thinking out loud.
L246327	u5562	m370	CLAY	What makes you say that?
L246320	u5562	m370	CLAY	Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
L246319	u5561	m370	BETTY	I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
L246318	u5562	m370	CLAY	Thanks, doll.
L246996	u5568	m370	HANNA	You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
L246995	u5562	m370	CLAY	But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
L246994	u5568	m370	HANNA	Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
L246993	u5562	m370	CLAY	We have his note.
L246992	u5568	m370	HANNA	The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
L246991	u5562	m370	CLAY	But I didn't do this!
L246990	u5568	m370	HANNA	You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
L246988	u5568	m370	HANNA	He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
L246987	u5562	m370	CLAY	He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
L246986	u5568	m370	HANNA	Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
L246985	u5562	m370	CLAY	I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
L246978	u5562	m370	CLAY	I put him to bed.  He's not there?
L246977	u5568	m370	HANNA	What have you done with him?
L246975	u5568	m370	HANNA	It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
L246974	u5562	m370	CLAY	Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
L246973	u5568	m370	HANNA	What do I do?
L246972	u5562	m370	CLAY	Thanks.  Why do you do it?
L246971	u5568	m370	HANNA	I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
L246970	u5562	m370	CLAY	Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
L246969	u5568	m370	HANNA	There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
L246968	u5562	m370	CLAY	I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
L246967	u5568	m370	HANNA	I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
L246966	u5562	m370	CLAY	It's not what you think.
L246500	u5568	m370	HANNA	Yes.  I trust you.
L246499	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm not going to hurt anyone.
L246498	u5568	m370	HANNA	Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
L246497	u5562	m370	CLAY	No!
L246496	u5568	m370	HANNA	You and he are not doing things?
L246495	u5562	m370	CLAY	Well...no, not really --
L246494	u5568	m370	HANNA	You did not know?
L246493	u5562	m370	CLAY	You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
L246492	u5568	m370	HANNA	That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
L246491	u5568	m370	HANNA	Yes!  You know?
L246490	u5562	m370	CLAY	A homo?
L246489	u5568	m370	HANNA	What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
L246488	u5568	m370	HANNA	No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
L246487	u5562	m370	CLAY	Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
L246486	u5568	m370	HANNA	This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
L246485	u5562	m370	CLAY	You're sure of that?
L246484	u5568	m370	HANNA	No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
L246483	u5562	m370	CLAY	Then you're as single as I am.
L246482	u5568	m370	HANNA	He is dead now, twenty years.
L246481	u5562	m370	CLAY	Yeah?  What's your husband do?
L246480	u5568	m370	HANNA	Of course.  I am married still.
L246479	u5562	m370	CLAY	You ever been married, Hanna?
L246477	u5562	m370	CLAY	You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
L246476	u5568	m370	HANNA	A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
L246475	u5562	m370	CLAY	Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
L246474	u5568	m370	HANNA	Why?
L246473	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm not married.
L246472	u5568	m370	HANNA	Your wife?
L246471	u5562	m370	CLAY	You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
L246470	u5568	m370	HANNA	No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
L246469	u5562	m370	CLAY	I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
L246468	u5568	m370	HANNA	Long enough.  Fifteen years.
L246467	u5562	m370	CLAY	How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
L246466	u5562	m370	CLAY	That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
L246465	u5568	m370	HANNA	No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
L246464	u5562	m370	CLAY	Tea is fine.
L246463	u5568	m370	HANNA	The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
L246462	u5568	m370	HANNA	Expect nothing fancy.
L246461	u5562	m370	CLAY	Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
L246460	u5568	m370	HANNA	The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
L246459	u5562	m370	CLAY	Something I can do for you?
L246263	u5562	m370	CLAY	You do that.
L246262	u5568	m370	HANNA	No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
L246261	u5562	m370	CLAY	Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
L246260	u5568	m370	HANNA	You will not hurt him?
L246259	u5562	m370	CLAY	Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
L246258	u5568	m370	HANNA	What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
L246257	u5562	m370	CLAY	What're you talking about?
L246256	u5568	m370	HANNA	I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
L246255	u5562	m370	CLAY	It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
L246253	u5568	m370	HANNA	The Master is waiting for you.
L246252	u5562	m370	CLAY	Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
L246961	u5572	m370	WHALE	Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
L246960	u5562	m370	CLAY	You'll feel better tomorrow.
L246959	u5572	m370	WHALE	When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
L246958	u5562	m370	CLAY	All right.
L246957	u5572	m370	WHALE	I can undress myself, thank you.
L246954	u5572	m370	WHALE	Pray you, undo this button.
L246953	u5562	m370	CLAY	Need some help?
L246952	u5572	m370	WHALE	Nothing I didn't deserve.
L246951	u5562	m370	CLAY	Did I hurt you?
L246950	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh Clayton.
L246949	u5562	m370	CLAY	You okay?
L246940	u5572	m370	WHALE	No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
L246939	u5562	m370	CLAY	Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
L246937	u5562	m370	CLAY	You're crazy.
L246936	u5572	m370	WHALE	Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
L246933	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
L246932	u5562	m370	CLAY	I haven't done a damn thing with you!
L246931	u5572	m370	WHALE	Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
L246929	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
L246928	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
L246922	u5572	m370	WHALE	Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
L246921	u5562	m370	CLAY	Just take off the fucking mask!
L246916	u5562	m370	CLAY	It's too tight.
L246915	u5572	m370	WHALE	What was that?
L246914	u5562	m370	CLAY	All right.  Let's take it off now.
L246911	u5572	m370	WHALE	There are straps in back.
L246910	u5562	m370	CLAY	It's from the first World War, isn't it?
L246909	u5572	m370	WHALE	Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
L246908	u5562	m370	CLAY	I don't know.
L246907	u5572	m370	WHALE	For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
L246906	u5562	m370	CLAY	Why?
L246904	u5572	m370	WHALE	Don't move.
L246903	u5562	m370	CLAY	What did you expect?  Bronze?
L246902	u5572	m370	WHALE	You are much too human.
L246901	u5562	m370	CLAY	What won't do?
L246900	u5572	m370	WHALE	No.  It won't do.
L246899	u5562	m370	CLAY	What'd you say?
L246898	u5572	m370	WHALE	So it is going to happen after all.
L246895	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
L246894	u5562	m370	CLAY	You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
L246893	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
L246887	u5562	m370	CLAY	Your friend?
L246886	u5572	m370	WHALE	Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
L246885	u5562	m370	CLAY	You're planning a trip?
L246884	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
L246883	u5562	m370	CLAY	But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
L246882	u5572	m370	WHALE	I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
L246881	u5562	m370	CLAY	"I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, ""The only monsters are here.""  I was wondering which here you meant."
L246880	u5562	m370	CLAY	James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
L246879	u5572	m370	WHALE	I don't remember that one.
L246878	u5562	m370	CLAY	"That's from your movie, right? ""The only monsters are here."""
L246877	u5572	m370	WHALE	A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters.
L246876	u5562	m370	CLAY	Storm's getting worse.
L246875	u5572	m370	WHALE	Not at all.
L246874	u5562	m370	CLAY	Do you mind?
L246873	u5572	m370	WHALE	That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
L246872	u5562	m370	CLAY	Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
L246871	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'm very sorry.
L246870	u5562	m370	CLAY	You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
L246868	u5562	m370	CLAY	I didn't have the guts for it.
L246867	u5572	m370	WHALE	What happened?
L246866	u5562	m370	CLAY	I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
L246865	u5572	m370	WHALE	Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
L246864	u5562	m370	CLAY	The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
L246863	u5562	m370	CLAY	That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
L246862	u5572	m370	WHALE	A very lucky thing indeed.
L246861	u5562	m370	CLAY	By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
L246860	u5572	m370	WHALE	The Great War?
L246859	u5562	m370	CLAY	My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
L246858	u5572	m370	WHALE	I see.
L246857	u5562	m370	CLAY	-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
L246856	u5572	m370	WHALE	But you said --
L246855	u5562	m370	CLAY	I never made it to Korea.
L246853	u5572	m370	WHALE	Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
L246852	u5562	m370	CLAY	Never gave it much thought.
L246851	u5572	m370	WHALE	Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
L246850	u5562	m370	CLAY	Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
L246849	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
L246848	u5562	m370	CLAY	I thought you'd given up on my picture.
L246847	u5572	m370	WHALE	After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
L246845	u5572	m370	WHALE	The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
L246844	u5562	m370	CLAY	Is that --?
L246843	u5572	m370	WHALE	Very sporting of you, Clayton.
L246842	u5562	m370	CLAY	Do I have any other choice?
L246841	u5572	m370	WHALE	Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
L246840	u5562	m370	CLAY	You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
L246839	u5572	m370	WHALE	That only leaves the rest.
L246835	u5562	m370	CLAY	No.  Definitely not.
L246834	u5572	m370	WHALE	You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
L246833	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
L246832	u5562	m370	CLAY	Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
L246831	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
L246824	u5562	m370	CLAY	Good.  Let's get dry.
L246823	u5572	m370	WHALE	Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
L246822	u5562	m370	CLAY	Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
L246821	u5572	m370	WHALE	It's not like her.
L246815	u5572	m370	WHALE	Catch my death.
L246814	u5562	m370	CLAY	I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
L246813	u5572	m370	WHALE	We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
L246812	u5562	m370	CLAY	You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
L246811	u5572	m370	WHALE	Let's get out of this funk hole
L246808	u5562	m370	CLAY	Can't you see?  It's raining!
L246807	u5572	m370	WHALE	Run for what?
L246806	u5562	m370	CLAY	Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
L246805	u5572	m370	WHALE	Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
L246804	u5562	m370	CLAY	Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
L246803	u5572	m370	WHALE	Neither of us really belongs here.
L246802	u5562	m370	CLAY	Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
L246801	u5572	m370	WHALE	Are you enjoying yourself?
L246735	u5572	m370	WHALE	David produced her last picture.
L246734	u5562	m370	CLAY	Is that really her?
L246733	u5572	m370	WHALE	Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
L246732	u5562	m370	CLAY	No.  The girl.
L246731	u5572	m370	WHALE	David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
L246730	u5562	m370	CLAY	Who's that?
L246729	u5572	m370	WHALE	Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
L246728	u5562	m370	CLAY	What was that about?
L246707	u5572	m370	WHALE	Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
L246706	u5562	m370	CLAY	I don't hear anything.
L246705	u5572	m370	WHALE	What did I tell you?  Listen.
L246702	u5572	m370	WHALE	Nothing would please me more.
L246701	u5562	m370	CLAY	If that's okay?
L246700	u5572	m370	WHALE	I suppose you'd like the top down.
L246698	u5562	m370	CLAY	Do I look okay?
L246697	u5572	m370	WHALE	Good afternoon, Clayton.
L246675	u5562	m370	CLAY	Clayton is fine.
L246674	u5572	m370	WHALE	Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
L246673	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm game.  Sure.
L246672	u5572	m370	WHALE	If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
L246670	u5562	m370	CLAY	You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
L246669	u5572	m370	WHALE	It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
L246668	u5562	m370	CLAY	No harm done.
L246667	u5572	m370	WHALE	My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
L246663	u5572	m370	WHALE	I want -- I want...
L246662	u5562	m370	CLAY	I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
L246661	u5572	m370	WHALE	Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
L246658	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
L246657	u5562	m370	CLAY	You asked me to model.  Remember?
L246656	u5572	m370	WHALE	You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
L246655	u5562	m370	CLAY	You're the one who started it.
L246654	u5572	m370	WHALE	Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
L246653	u5562	m370	CLAY	I didn't --
L246652	u5572	m370	WHALE	You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
L246648	u5562	m370	CLAY	Something happened to him?
L246647	u5572	m370	WHALE	Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
L246645	u5572	m370	WHALE	No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
L246644	u5562	m370	CLAY	This was World War I?
L246643	u5572	m370	WHALE	I was an officer.
L246642	u5562	m370	CLAY	You were a soldier?
L246641	u5572	m370	WHALE	Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
L246640	u5562	m370	CLAY	You're talking through your hat now.
L246639	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
L246638	u5562	m370	CLAY	You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
L246637	u5572	m370	WHALE	No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
L246636	u5562	m370	CLAY	There's no people like you in my crowd.
L246635	u5572	m370	WHALE	Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
L246634	u5562	m370	CLAY	Not fear.  More like disgust.
L246633	u5572	m370	WHALE	And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
L246632	u5562	m370	CLAY	I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
L246631	u5572	m370	WHALE	What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
L246630	u5562	m370	CLAY	Not me.
L246629	u5572	m370	WHALE	Everybody has stories to tell.
L246628	u5562	m370	CLAY	I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
L246627	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
L246625	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
L246624	u5572	m370	WHALE	Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
L246607	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh no.  I never swim.
L246606	u5562	m370	CLAY	You first.
L246605	u5572	m370	WHALE	The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
L246600	u5562	m370	CLAY	From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
L246599	u5572	m370	WHALE	I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
L246598	u5562	m370	CLAY	Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
L246596	u5562	m370	CLAY	Cut it out!
L246595	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
L246593	u5572	m370	WHALE	Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
L246592	u5562	m370	CLAY	How long were you...?
L246591	u5572	m370	WHALE	"But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely ""the friend.""  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer."
L246590	u5572	m370	WHALE	Better work.
L246589	u5562	m370	CLAY	You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
L246588	u5572	m370	WHALE	I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
L246586	u5572	m370	WHALE	It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
L246585	u5562	m370	CLAY	Do you miss it?
L246584	u5572	m370	WHALE	After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
L246583	u5572	m370	WHALE	The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
L246582	u5562	m370	CLAY	What happened?
L246581	u5572	m370	WHALE	"You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done ""Show Boat."" Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  ""The Road Back.""  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece."
L246580	u5572	m370	WHALE	In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
L246579	u5562	m370	CLAY	Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
L246578	u5572	m370	WHALE	I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
L246577	u5562	m370	CLAY	Thoreau with a lawnmower.
L246576	u5572	m370	WHALE	Ah.  A philosopher.
L246575	u5562	m370	CLAY	The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
L246574	u5572	m370	WHALE	Very well put.
L246573	u5562	m370	CLAY	You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
L246572	u5572	m370	WHALE	Why not?
L246571	u5562	m370	CLAY	Not at the moment.
L246570	u5572	m370	WHALE	Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
L246569	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
L246568	u5562	m370	CLAY	I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
L246566	u5572	m370	WHALE	Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.
L246565	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
L246564	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
L246562	u5562	m370	CLAY	I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
L246561	u5572	m370	WHALE	But we have to match the other sketch.
L246560	u5562	m370	CLAY	Sorry.  Not today.
L246559	u5572	m370	WHALE	It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
L246558	u5562	m370	CLAY	Can I see what you did so far?
L246556	u5562	m370	CLAY	No.  I --
L246555	u5572	m370	WHALE	I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
L246554	u5562	m370	CLAY	What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
L246553	u5572	m370	WHALE	So we understand each other?
L246552	u5572	m370	WHALE	Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
L246551	u5562	m370	CLAY	You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
L246550	u5572	m370	WHALE	What way might that be?
L246549	u5562	m370	CLAY	You don't think of me that way, do you?
L246548	u5572	m370	WHALE	I never thought you were.
L246547	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm not, you know.
L246546	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
L246545	u5562	m370	CLAY	No, I -- you're a homosexual.
L246544	u5572	m370	WHALE	Does that surprise you?
L246543	u5572	m370	WHALE	Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
L246542	u5562	m370	CLAY	So you had a wife?
L246541	u5572	m370	WHALE	No.  At least not in the legal sense.
L246540	u5562	m370	CLAY	You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
L246539	u5572	m370	WHALE	Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
L246537	u5572	m370	WHALE	All righty.  I understand.
L246536	u5562	m370	CLAY	Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
L246535	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
L246534	u5562	m370	CLAY	Can't today.
L246533	u5572	m370	WHALE	What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
L246532	u5562	m370	CLAY	Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
L246531	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
L246530	u5562	m370	CLAY	No.  I could have, though.
L246529	u5572	m370	WHALE	Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
L246528	u5562	m370	CLAY	Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
L246527	u5572	m370	WHALE	It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
L246526	u5562	m370	CLAY	I don't like to talk about that.
L246525	u5572	m370	WHALE	Did you kill anyone?
L246523	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
L246522	u5562	m370	CLAY	Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
L246521	u5572	m370	WHALE	Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
L246520	u5562	m370	CLAY	No.
L246519	u5572	m370	WHALE	Did anyone laugh?
L246518	u5562	m370	CLAY	I liked it.  We all did.
L246517	u5572	m370	WHALE	Did you now?
L246516	u5562	m370	CLAY	Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
L246513	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
L246512	u5562	m370	CLAY	This David's a friend?
L246511	u5572	m370	WHALE	Is this David's doing?
L246507	u5562	m370	CLAY	Go ahead.
L246506	u5572	m370	WHALE	Do you mind?
L246504	u5572	m370	WHALE	I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
L246503	u5562	m370	CLAY	All right, I guess.
L246502	u5572	m370	WHALE	How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
L246306	u5562	m370	CLAY	I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
L246305	u5572	m370	WHALE	You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
L246301	u5572	m370	WHALE	In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
L246300	u5562	m370	CLAY	I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
L246299	u5572	m370	WHALE	No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
L246298	u5562	m370	CLAY	We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
L246297	u5572	m370	WHALE	There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
L246296	u5572	m370	WHALE	I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
L246295	u5562	m370	CLAY	What?
L246294	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
L246293	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
L246292	u5562	m370	CLAY	Your family ate dripping?
L246291	u5572	m370	WHALE	It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
L246290	u5562	m370	CLAY	Sounds like something you feed the dog.
L246289	u5572	m370	WHALE	Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
L246288	u5572	m370	WHALE	It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
L246287	u5562	m370	CLAY	No.  I'm fine.
L246286	u5572	m370	WHALE	Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
L246284	u5572	m370	WHALE	That's exactly what I intend to do.
L246283	u5562	m370	CLAY	Take a picture, it lasts longer.
L246280	u5562	m370	CLAY	All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
L246279	u5572	m370	WHALE	We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
L246278	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
L246277	u5562	m370	CLAY	But it's just my face you want to draw.
L246276	u5572	m370	WHALE	Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
L246275	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm not wearing an undershirt.
L246274	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
L246273	u5562	m370	CLAY	It's new.
L246272	u5572	m370	WHALE	That shirt, Mr. Boone.
L246270	u5572	m370	WHALE	"Hmmm.  I much prefer ""Show Boat"" or ""The Invisible Man.""  Shall we begin?"
L246269	u5562	m370	CLAY	Bride of Frankenstein.
L246268	u5572	m370	WHALE	You don't say?  Which picture?
L246267	u5562	m370	CLAY	Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
L246239	u5572	m370	WHALE	Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
L246238	u5562	m370	CLAY	All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
L246237	u5572	m370	WHALE	I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
L246236	u5562	m370	CLAY	You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
L246235	u5572	m370	WHALE	What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
L246234	u5562	m370	CLAY	And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
L246233	u5572	m370	WHALE	Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
L246232	u5562	m370	CLAY	But why?
L246231	u5572	m370	WHALE	Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
L246230	u5562	m370	CLAY	You mean -- you really want to draw me?
L246229	u5572	m370	WHALE	I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
L246228	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes.  You were a Marine.
L246227	u5562	m370	CLAY	Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
L246226	u5572	m370	WHALE	You went to university?
L246225	u5562	m370	CLAY	Football in college.
L246224	u5572	m370	WHALE	But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
L246223	u5562	m370	CLAY	Broke is more like it.
L246222	u5572	m370	WHALE	You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
L246221	u5562	m370	CLAY	What's to sketch?
L246220	u5572	m370	WHALE	Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
L246219	u5562	m370	CLAY	You mean, like posed for pictures?
L246218	u5572	m370	WHALE	To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
L246217	u5562	m370	CLAY	Huh?
L246216	u5572	m370	WHALE	You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
L246215	u5572	m370	WHALE	Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
L246214	u5562	m370	CLAY	What was wrong?
L246213	u5572	m370	WHALE	I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
L246212	u5562	m370	CLAY	What did she mean by going flooey?
L246211	u5572	m370	WHALE	When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
L246202	u5572	m370	WHALE	Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
L246201	u5562	m370	CLAY	Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
L246200	u5572	m370	WHALE	I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
L246199	u5562	m370	CLAY	"Frankenstein and ""Bride of"" and ""Son of"" and all the rest?"
L246198	u5562	m370	CLAY	Really?
L246197	u5572	m370	WHALE	"This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the ""Frankenstein"" pictures."
L246196	u5562	m370	CLAY	Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
L246195	u5572	m370	WHALE	In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
L246194	u5562	m370	CLAY	Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
L246193	u5572	m370	WHALE	But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
L246192	u5562	m370	CLAY	They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
L246191	u5572	m370	WHALE	They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
L246190	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
L246189	u5572	m370	WHALE	You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
L246188	u5562	m370	CLAY	Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
L246187	u5572	m370	WHALE	What?  Oh yes.
L246186	u5562	m370	CLAY	These are your paintings?
L246183	u5572	m370	WHALE	Splendid.
L246182	u5562	m370	CLAY	No.  Iced tea's fine.
L246181	u5572	m370	WHALE	Or would you prefer a beer?
L246180	u5572	m370	WHALE	The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
L246179	u5562	m370	CLAY	I stink to high heaven right now.
L246178	u5572	m370	WHALE	I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
L246177	u5562	m370	CLAY	Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
L246176	u5572	m370	WHALE	Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
L246053	u5562	m370	CLAY	Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
L246052	u5572	m370	WHALE	Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
L246051	u5572	m370	WHALE	The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
L246050	u5562	m370	CLAY	Just that I was in the Marines.
L246049	u5572	m370	WHALE	I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
L246048	u5562	m370	CLAY	Boone.  Clayton Boone.
L246047	u5572	m370	WHALE	And your name is --?
L246046	u5562	m370	CLAY	Nice place.
L246045	u5572	m370	WHALE	My name is Whale.  This is my house.
L246044	u5562	m370	CLAY	Mornin'.
L246043	u5572	m370	WHALE	Good morning.
L246619	u5562	m370	CLAY	Have a drink?
L246618	u5565	m370	DWIGHT	Hey, Boone.
L246367	u5562	m370	CLAY	I think I'll hang around.
L246366	u5565	m370	DWIGHT	You coming, Boone?
L246324	u5565	m370	DWIGHT	Ooooh.
L246323	u5562	m370	CLAY	This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
L246310	u5565	m370	DWIGHT	You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
L246309	u5562	m370	CLAY	I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
L246165	u5565	m370	DWIGHT	Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
L246164	u5562	m370	CLAY	I'm up.  Thanks.
L246163	u5565	m370	DWIGHT	You told me to get you up, asshole.
L246162	u5562	m370	CLAY	Fuck off!
L246161	u5565	m370	DWIGHT	Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
L246615	u5569	m370	HARRY	She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
L246614	u5562	m370	CLAY	Where's Betty?
L246369	u5562	m370	CLAY	I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
L246368	u5569	m370	HARRY	Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
L246356	u5562	m370	CLAY	The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
L246355	u5569	m370	HARRY	Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
L246351	u5562	m370	CLAY	I just want to watch it, okay?
L246350	u5569	m370	HARRY	You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
L246335	u5562	m370	CLAY	Good.  Fine.
L246334	u5569	m370	HARRY	Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
L246313	u5569	m370	HARRY	I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
L246312	u5562	m370	CLAY	If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
L246311	u5569	m370	HARRY	Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
L246758	u5563	m370	DAVID	All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
L246757	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes.  Perfectly.
L246756	u5563	m370	DAVID	Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
L246755	u5572	m370	WHALE	Then who did?
L246754	u5563	m370	DAVID	I didn't ask George to invite you.
L246753	u5572	m370	WHALE	No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
L246752	u5563	m370	DAVID	Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
L246751	u5572	m370	WHALE	But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
L246750	u5563	m370	DAVID	You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
L246749	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
L246748	u5563	m370	DAVID	You only embarrass yourself.
L246747	u5572	m370	WHALE	I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
L246746	u5563	m370	DAVID	You didn't, Jimmy.
L246745	u5572	m370	WHALE	You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
L246743	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
L246742	u5563	m370	DAVID	Should you be drinking in your condition?
L246738	u5563	m370	DAVID	I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
L246737	u5572	m370	WHALE	Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
L246736	u5563	m370	DAVID	What are you doing here?
L246036	u5563	m370	DAVID	Goodbye, Hanna.
L246035	u5572	m370	WHALE	Thank you.
L246034	u5563	m370	DAVID	By the way, I like the Renoir.
L246033	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
L246032	u5563	m370	DAVID	You remember how a production eats up one's life.
L246031	u5572	m370	WHALE	The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars.
L246030	u5563	m370	DAVID	I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
L246029	u5572	m370	WHALE	I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
L246028	u5563	m370	DAVID	Then take the pills.
L246027	u5572	m370	WHALE	It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
L246026	u5563	m370	DAVID	She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
L246251	u5572	m370	WHALE	You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
L246250	u5564	m370	DR. PAYNE	Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
L246249	u5572	m370	WHALE	So what do I do?
L246248	u5564	m370	DR. PAYNE	In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
L246247	u5572	m370	WHALE	But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
L246246	u5564	m370	DR. PAYNE	That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
L246245	u5572	m370	WHALE	You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
L246244	u5564	m370	DR. PAYNE	The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
L246243	u5564	m370	DR. PAYNE	That's what I'm trying to explain.
L246242	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
L246241	u5564	m370	DR. PAYNE	You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
L246434	u5567	m370	ERNEST THESIGER	My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
L246433	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	More your line.
L246432	u5567	m370	ERNEST THESIGER	I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
L246431	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
L246430	u5567	m370	ERNEST THESIGER	Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
L246429	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
L246428	u5567	m370	ERNEST THESIGER	My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
L246798	u5572	m370	WHALE	Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
L246797	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
L246782	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh dear.
L246781	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
L246780	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	What's our pesky friend up to now?
L246779	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course.
L246778	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
L246777	u5572	m370	WHALE	Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
L246776	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
L246775	u5572	m370	WHALE	But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
L246774	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
L246773	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
L246772	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
L246771	u5572	m370	WHALE	Elsa?
L246770	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	Jimmy.  How are you?
L246424	u5572	m370	WHALE	Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
L246423	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
L246420	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	Boris?  Do I look a fright?
L246419	u5572	m370	WHALE	Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
L246418	u5566	m370	ELSA LANCHESTER	Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
L246695	u5568	m370	HANNA	No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
L246694	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
L246693	u5568	m370	HANNA	That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
L246689	u5568	m370	HANNA	It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
L246688	u5572	m370	WHALE	It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
L246687	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
L246686	u5568	m370	HANNA	I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
L246685	u5572	m370	WHALE	Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
L246684	u5568	m370	HANNA	No.  But someone you can talk to.
L246683	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
L246682	u5568	m370	HANNA	Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
L246622	u5568	m370	HANNA	A visitor.
L246621	u5572	m370	WHALE	Who was that at the door?
L246458	u5568	m370	HANNA	Of course.  This afternoon.
L246457	u5572	m370	WHALE	Does the yardman come today?
L246413	u5568	m370	HANNA	Good night.
L246412	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
L246411	u5568	m370	HANNA	You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
L246359	u5572	m370	WHALE	She is beautiful.
L246358	u5568	m370	HANNA	She is horrible.
L246353	u5572	m370	WHALE	No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
L246352	u5568	m370	HANNA	He is not going to kill the old man?
L246342	u5572	m370	WHALE	Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
L246341	u5568	m370	HANNA	Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
L246210	u5572	m370	WHALE	Go.
L246209	u5568	m370	HANNA	He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
L246208	u5572	m370	WHALE	Just go.  We can manage without you.
L246207	u5568	m370	HANNA	I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
L246206	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
L246205	u5568	m370	HANNA	You remember what the doctor tells us.
L246204	u5572	m370	WHALE	My mind's lovely.  And yours?
L246203	u5568	m370	HANNA	How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
L246160	u5572	m370	WHALE	No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
L246159	u5568	m370	HANNA	Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
L246158	u5572	m370	WHALE	Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
L246157	u5568	m370	HANNA	I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
L246156	u5572	m370	WHALE	You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
L246151	u5572	m370	WHALE	Luminal.
L246150	u5568	m370	HANNA	Which ones?  I bring them all.
L246066	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes?
L246065	u5568	m370	HANNA	Mr. Kay, sir.
L246064	u5572	m370	WHALE	Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
L246063	u5568	m370	HANNA	Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
L246062	u5572	m370	WHALE	There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
L246041	u5568	m370	HANNA	Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
L246040	u5572	m370	WHALE	Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
L246769	u5570	m370	KAY	Don't go away.
L246768	u5572	m370	WHALE	My monsters?
L246767	u5570	m370	KAY	Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
L246766	u5572	m370	WHALE	I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
L246765	u5570	m370	KAY	I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
L246764	u5572	m370	WHALE	You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
L246763	u5570	m370	KAY	I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
L246762	u5572	m370	WHALE	You didn't?
L246761	u5570	m370	KAY	Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
L246760	u5572	m370	WHALE	Mr....Kay?
L246155	u5570	m370	KAY	Right.
L246154	u5572	m370	WHALE	I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
L246153	u5570	m370	KAY	I was going to take a swim.
L246147	u5572	m370	WHALE	Head.  Not heart.
L246146	u5570	m370	KAY	Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
L246145	u5572	m370	WHALE	I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
L246144	u5570	m370	KAY	Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
L246140	u5572	m370	WHALE	You think so?  That's very kind --
L246139	u5570	m370	KAY	He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
L246138	u5572	m370	WHALE	My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
L246137	u5570	m370	KAY	Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
L246136	u5572	m370	WHALE	Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
L246135	u5572	m370	WHALE	Righto.  Let me see.
L246134	u5570	m370	KAY	"Okay.  ""Frankenstein.""  Tell me everything."
L246133	u5572	m370	WHALE	Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
L246132	u5570	m370	KAY	Just like going swimming, isn't it?
L246131	u5570	m370	KAY	I can't believe I'm doing this.
L246130	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course.
L246129	u5570	m370	KAY	Can that count as one question?
L246128	u5570	m370	KAY	"Will you tell me everything you remember about making ""Frankenstein""?"
L246127	u5572	m370	WHALE	Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
L246126	u5570	m370	KAY	Can we talk about the horror movies now?
L246124	u5570	m370	KAY	I guess.
L246123	u5572	m370	WHALE	Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
L246122	u5572	m370	WHALE	Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
L246121	u5570	m370	KAY	"George Cukor?  Who made ""A Star Is Born""?  I never guessed."
L246120	u5572	m370	WHALE	You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
L246119	u5570	m370	KAY	Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
L246113	u5572	m370	WHALE	A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
L246112	u5570	m370	KAY	That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
L246111	u5572	m370	WHALE	What rumors might those be?
L246110	u5570	m370	KAY	Then the rumors are true?
L246109	u5572	m370	WHALE	Quite.
L246108	u5570	m370	KAY	You're serious.
L246107	u5572	m370	WHALE	It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
L246106	u5570	m370	KAY	That's funny, Mr. Whale.
L246105	u5572	m370	WHALE	Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
L246104	u5570	m370	KAY	I don't mind.
L246103	u5572	m370	WHALE	I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
L246101	u5570	m370	KAY	No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
L246100	u5572	m370	WHALE	I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
L246099	u5570	m370	KAY	But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
L246098	u5572	m370	WHALE	Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
L246097	u5570	m370	KAY	Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
L246096	u5572	m370	WHALE	Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
L246095	u5570	m370	KAY	"How much longer before we get to ""Frankenstein""?"
L246094	u5572	m370	WHALE	"There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called ""Journey's End"".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  ""Journey's End"" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned."
L246090	u5572	m370	WHALE	Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
L246089	u5570	m370	KAY	Your father was a schoolmaster?
L246088	u5572	m370	WHALE	Yes?
L246086	u5572	m370	WHALE	I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...
L246085	u5570	m370	KAY	Everything.  Start at the beginning.
L246084	u5572	m370	WHALE	So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
L246081	u5570	m370	KAY	Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
L246080	u5572	m370	WHALE	This is the studio where I paint.
L246078	u5572	m370	WHALE	After you then.
L246077	u5570	m370	KAY	Sure.
L246076	u5572	m370	WHALE	Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
L246075	u5572	m370	WHALE	Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
L246074	u5570	m370	KAY	"That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  ""Bride of Frankenstein."""
L246072	u5570	m370	KAY	I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
L246071	u5572	m370	WHALE	One likes to live simply.
L246070	u5570	m370	KAY	And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
L246069	u5572	m370	WHALE	No.  I expect you can't.
L246068	u5570	m370	KAY	Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
L246719	u5571	m370	PRINCESS MARGARET	I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
L246718	u5572	m370	WHALE	Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
L246717	u5571	m370	PRINCESS MARGARET	Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
L246716	u5571	m370	PRINCESS MARGARET	I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
L246715	u5572	m370	WHALE	Sit?
L246714	u5571	m370	PRINCESS MARGARET	Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
L246713	u5571	m370	PRINCESS MARGARET	Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
L246712	u5572	m370	WHALE	Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
L246711	u5571	m370	PRINCESS MARGARET	How are you?
L339238	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
L339237	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I worry about them.
L339236	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Khambas are wild men.
L339235	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
L339234	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Kham, Holiness.
L339233	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where are you from?
L339232	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Yes, Holiness.
L339231	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	All quiet?
L339226	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes. I am ready.
L339225	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Please, come, Holiness.
L339224	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	A moment.
L339223	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	We must go, Holiness.
L338850	u6234	m417	BOY	I know.
L338849	u6253	m417	WOMAN	"And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. ""The Protector."""
L338847	u6234	m417	BOY	No cried?
L338846	u6253	m417	WOMAN	You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
L338841	u6234	m417	BOY	Cow.
L338840	u6253	m417	WOMAN	Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
L338839	u6234	m417	BOY	Tell me.
L338838	u6253	m417	WOMAN	Again?
L338837	u6234	m417	BOY	Mama, my story.
L339333	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	No!
L339332	u6235	m417	FATHER	Goodbye, Kundun.
L339011	u6235	m417	FATHER	Hmmm.
L339010	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I free the prisoners?
L339009	u6235	m417	FATHER	I will buy them for you.
L339008	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Here. We'll collect them.
L339007	u6235	m417	FATHER	Where will you keep them?
L339006	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will you buy the sheep for me?
L339005	u6235	m417	FATHER	I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
L339004	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And you have horses? You love horses.
L339003	u6235	m417	FATHER	I do, now.
L338997	u6235	m417	FATHER	Are you? Of whom?
L338996	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, I am in charge.
L338995	u6235	m417	FATHER	No.
L338994	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I do anything I want?
L338993	u6235	m417	FATHER	Not the way to talk to people.
L338990	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	It is alright, Father.
L338989	u6235	m417	FATHER	I am sorry, Lhamo.
L339359	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	And we will begin with tearing it down.
L339358	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
L339357	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	I will not approve it.
L339356	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
L339355	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
L339354	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
L339353	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
L339352	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
L339351	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
L339350	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
L339349	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
L339348	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
L339347	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
L339346	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Are you, General?
L339345	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
L339344	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
L339343	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
L339311	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
L339310	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Soon.
L339309	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
L339306	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	I have a copy for you.
L339305	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have.
L339304	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
L339303	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Thank you. Please sit.
L339302	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
L339301	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	General Chiang.
L339300	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Dalai Lama.
L339317	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
L339316	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
L339299	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Then, we shall meet.
L339298	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
L339297	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes.
L339296	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Holiness?
L339295	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes, but they say he did.
L339294	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
L339285	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Time to study.
L339284	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Yes.
L339281	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He is a capable man.
L339280	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
L339279	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
L339278	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	I am afraid.
L339277	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	With much bloodshed.
L339276	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
L339275	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	So, we must face China and all her might alone.
L339271	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
L339270	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And the United Nations? Surely?
L339268	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	All?
L339267	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
L339124	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	We did not.
L339123	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Did you receive the letter?
L339122	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	"The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the ""Chinese region of Tibet"". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it."
L339121	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
L339116	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	It is calm.
L339115	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Sera monks have surrendered?
L339114	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
L338930	u6246	m417	MOTHER	We do not know.
L338929	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Who am I?
L338915	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
L338914	u6239	m417	LHAMO	This many?
L338913	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Two.
L338912	u6239	m417	LHAMO	How many?
L338911	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I will be back in a few days.
L338899	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I miss him too.
L338898	u6239	m417	LHAMO	I miss my brother.
L338897	u6246	m417	MOTHER	You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
L338896	u6239	m417	LHAMO	I pooped.
L338895	u6246	m417	MOTHER	At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
L338894	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Me. First break of day.
L338893	u6246	m417	MOTHER	"Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, ""His time has come."""
L338892	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Cow.
L338891	u6246	m417	MOTHER	He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
L338890	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Your father had been very sick.
L338863	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Far, far away.
L338862	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Oh, no. Where will he go?
L339049	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	Answer. 
L339048	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I need to squeeze this brain.
L339045	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
L339044	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
L339043	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
L339042	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	I accept it. What is suffering?
L339041	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
L339014	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	Not until you are eighteen.
L339013	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am him.
L339012	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
L339002	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you have money?
L339001	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	What do you think?
L339000	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do I have money?
L338999	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	You could buy them.
L338998	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
L339431	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
L339430	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
L339424	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
L339423	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I will not go.
L339422	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
L339411	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The people will not allow it.
L339410	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	They will take Lhasa next.
L339400	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
L339399	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
L339398	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
L339397	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
L339396	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
L339395	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
L339394	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
L339393	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
L339390	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I had relinquished doubt.
L339389	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Did you ever doubt it?
L339325	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
L339324	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
L339323	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am scared.
L339321	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
L339320	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
L339319	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
L339318	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
L339283	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
L339282	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
L339274	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	In the Americas.
L339273	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is that?
L339272	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	"One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called ""El Salvador""."
L339169	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	"The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, ""The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming."" And then, the radio went dead."
L339168	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Has anyone died?
L339167	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
L339166	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What is the size of our army, now?
L339136	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
L339135	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Quite simple. Yes. Good.
L339134	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
L339133	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	America, we shall see.
L339132	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And, America?
L339131	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Britain chooses not to.
L339130	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Britain?
L339129	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
L339128	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can India help us?
L339127	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
L339126	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
L339125	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
L339120	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
L339119	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Ask whatever you will.
L339118	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
L339107	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
L339106	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What can I do? I am only a boy.
L339098	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Look here!
L339097	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
L339086	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	When it is time.
L339085	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tell me.
L339084	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	He warned about the future of Tibet.
L339083	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
L339078	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I do not know, Holiness.
L339077	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is Alsace?
L339076	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	It is an island. American territory.
L339075	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	In the Pacific Ocean.
L339065	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will we ever be in war?
L339064	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	No. This war is almost over.
L339063	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will we be in this war?
L339062	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
L339061	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	No. Not very big.
L339060	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Is that big?
L339059	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Roughly five thousand men.
L339058	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	How big is Tibet's army?
L339057	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Please.
L339056	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
L338869	u6244	m417	MAN	Thank you.
L338868	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
L338867	u6244	m417	MAN	We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
L338866	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Please, come in, so cold.
L338865	u6244	m417	MAN	Good day.
L338864	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Good day.
L339384	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Always.
L339383	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
L339382	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
L339381	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
L339380	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I leave tomorrow.
L339379	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
L339376	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
L339375	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
L339374	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
L339373	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
L339372	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
L339371	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
L339370	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
L339369	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
L339427	u6246	m417	MOTHER	You decide.
L339426	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you think I must?
L339029	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
L339028	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You will always!
L339027	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Me?
L339026	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But you will always be here?
L339025	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
L339024	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
L339023	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
L339022	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	"Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is ""lavish"" and ""willful"". ""How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"""
L339021	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
L339264	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
L339263	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	What does the butter spot feel like?
L339262	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You decide.
L339261	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	True.
L339260	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What do you think?
L339259	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	Is that a true story, or pretend?
L339258	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
L339257	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	Does he have the spot?
L339256	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
L339219	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
L339218	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You have grown up very good.
L339217	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	We have.
L339216	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
L339215	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I will miss you.
L339214	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
L339212	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
L339211	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Am I running away?
L339210	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	No, Holiness.
L339209	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You will not come?
L339179	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
L339178	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, I have no experience.
L339177	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
L339176	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
L339175	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	The people want you made Dalai Lama.
L339096	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
L339095	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
L339080	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Ahh.
L339079	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This is Tibet. And this is China.
L339073	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is Poland?
L339072	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Ahh.
L339071	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This is Britain.
L339069	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
L339068	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Yes.
L339067	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Chinese.
L339066	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	We have enemies.
L338986	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I would not know. Maybe.
L338985	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
L338984	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
L338983	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
L338982	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You cannot.
L338981	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
L338980	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
L338979	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to go down there.
L338975	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	As you say.
L338974	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Pretend.
L338973	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	It is a story, you decide.
L338972	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Is that true or pretend?
L338971	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
L338955	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
L338954	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Things change, Kundun.
L338952	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I have smarter men.
L338951	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have more men.
L338950	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I am braver.
L338949	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
L338948	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
L339201	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	It may not be your decision to make.
L339200	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	How could I ever leave?
L339199	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
L339198	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
L339197	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
L339196	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
L339195	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	We cannot.
L339194	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
L339193	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
L339192	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	I do.
L339191	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
L339190	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
L339188	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	Eliminate you.
L339187	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You, kill me?
L339186	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
L339185	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tell me.
L339155	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
L339154	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
L339153	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	It is a difficult situation.
L339152	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
L339151	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	What would you do, Holiness?
L339150	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
L339113	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
L339112	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	Completely.
L339111	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You are unharmed?
L339110	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	It is possible, Holiness.
L339109	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
L339255	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	I see that.
L339254	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Like my mother.
L339253	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
L339252	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Much too young.
L339251	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	Too young?
L339250	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	No.
L339248	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Does he treat you fairly?
L339247	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
L339246	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Hmm.
L339245	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
L339244	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Did you love your husband, before you married?
L370302	u6499	m432	ANDY	Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
L370301	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Really?
L370300	u6499	m432	ANDY	Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
L370299	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
L370295	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Yeah...
L370294	u6499	m432	ANDY	My hair is coming out.
L370293	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You've got good days and bad days.
L370292	u6499	m432	ANDY	I can't move my arm.
L370257	u6499	m432	ANDY	Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
L370256	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
L370255	u6499	m432	ANDY	Tony Clifton.
L370254	u6502	m432	GEORGE	So who's gonna pay for it?
L370253	u6499	m432	ANDY	I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
L370241	u6499	m432	ANDY	No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
L370240	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Do you wanna tour the clubs?
L370239	u6499	m432	ANDY	I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
L370238	u6502	m432	GEORGE	So how can I help you...?
L370237	u6499	m432	ANDY	Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
L370236	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
L370235	u6499	m432	ANDY	Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
L370234	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You must take a little pleasure in it.
L370231	u6499	m432	ANDY	It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
L370230	u6502	m432	GEORGE	What was that all about?
L370197	u6499	m432	ANDY	I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
L370196	u6502	m432	GEORGE	That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
L370195	u6499	m432	ANDY	No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
L370184	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
L370183	u6499	m432	ANDY	The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
L370159	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
L370158	u6499	m432	ANDY	Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
L370134	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
L370133	u6499	m432	ANDY	Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
L370127	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
L370126	u6499	m432	ANDY	We were just trying to push the envelope --
L369999	u6502	m432	GEORGE	He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
L369998	u6499	m432	ANDY	What, you don't think I can beat him?
L369997	u6502	m432	GEORGE	"Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  ""Here I come to save the day!""?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!"
L369941	u6499	m432	ANDY	That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
L369940	u6502	m432	GEORGE	WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
L369939	u6499	m432	ANDY	They're having a laugh...
L369938	u6502	m432	GEORGE	No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
L369937	u6499	m432	ANDY	That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
L369914	u6502	m432	GEORGE	But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
L369913	u6499	m432	ANDY	George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
L369908	u6502	m432	GEORGE	"Funny?  I dunno.  But ""intriguing""... ""mindboggling""... perhaps ""headache-inducing""... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage..."
L369907	u6499	m432	ANDY	But wasn't it funny?
L369906	u6502	m432	GEORGE	"You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: ""Look, Dad, I got an F!"""
L369848	u6502	m432	GEORGE	There'll be other shots.
L369847	u6499	m432	ANDY	Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
L369843	u6499	m432	ANDY	Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
L369842	u6502	m432	GEORGE	I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
L369841	u6499	m432	ANDY	Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
L369840	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
L369839	u6499	m432	ANDY	Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
L369807	u6502	m432	GEORGE	I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
L369806	u6499	m432	ANDY	How long would they let me sleep?
L369805	u6502	m432	GEORGE	And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
L369804	u6499	m432	ANDY	But George, I like to push the boundaries...
L369803	u6502	m432	GEORGE	When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
L369801	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
L369800	u6499	m432	ANDY	I'm sorry, George...
L369776	u6499	m432	ANDY	Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
L369775	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
L369774	u6499	m432	ANDY	"Yeah, we can have a garage sale. ""Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"""
L369773	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
L369772	u6499	m432	ANDY	The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
L369771	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
L369711	u6499	m432	ANDY	What's up?
L369710	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy!
L369677	u6502	m432	GEORGE	That's alright.  Where...?
L369676	u6499	m432	ANDY	Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
L369675	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
L369674	u6499	m432	ANDY	Hi George!
L369673	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy?
L369664	u6499	m432	ANDY	He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
L369663	u6502	m432	GEORGE	"They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- ""two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton""??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!"
L369662	u6499	m432	ANDY	Those are my terms.
L369661	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
L369659	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
L369658	u6499	m432	ANDY	Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
L369657	u6502	m432	GEORGE	LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
L369656	u6499	m432	ANDY	I refuse.
L369655	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You have to do it.
L369654	u6499	m432	ANDY	I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
L369653	u6502	m432	GEORGE	B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
L369652	u6499	m432	ANDY	I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
L369651	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
L369650	u6499	m432	ANDY	No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
L369649	u6502	m432	GEORGE	"No?  ""No"" to which part??"
L369648	u6499	m432	ANDY	No.
L369647	u6502	m432	GEORGE	"HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  ""Latka,"" a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!"
L369646	u6499	m432	ANDY	George, I hate sitcoms.
L369645	u6499	m432	ANDY	I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
L369644	u6502	m432	GEORGE	And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
L369643	u6499	m432	ANDY	Sitcom...?
L369642	u6502	m432	GEORGE	That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
L369641	u6499	m432	ANDY	The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
L369640	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
L369601	u6499	m432	ANDY	I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
L369600	u6502	m432	GEORGE	You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
L369599	u6499	m432	ANDY	I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
L369598	u6502	m432	GEORGE	People love... comedians.
L369594	u6499	m432	ANDY	It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
L369593	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
L369592	u6499	m432	ANDY	No.  Caspiar.
L369591	u6502	m432	GEORGE	So I understand you're from Lithuania?
L369590	u6499	m432	ANDY	Tank you veddy much.
L369589	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
L369571	u6507	m432	MANAGER	"Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' ""Pop Goes The Weasel."""
L369570	u6499	m432	ANDY	I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
L369569	u6507	m432	MANAGER	Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
L369568	u6499	m432	ANDY	"What do you want?  ""Take my wife, please""??"
L369567	u6507	m432	MANAGER	Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
L369566	u6499	m432	ANDY	You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
L369565	u6507	m432	MANAGER	Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
L369564	u6499	m432	ANDY	So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
L370083	u6499	m432	ANDY	But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
L370082	u6512	m432	STANLEY	Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
L370081	u6499	m432	ANDY	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
L370080	u6512	m432	STANLEY	B-but... we saw... your neck...
L370074	u6499	m432	ANDY	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
L370073	u6512	m432	STANLEY	B-but... we saw... your neck...
L369551	u6512	m432	STANLEY	No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
L369550	u6499	m432	ANDY	B-but I have them.
L369549	u6512	m432	STANLEY	You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
L369548	u6499	m432	ANDY	But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
L369546	u6499	m432	ANDY	Oh!
L369545	u6512	m432	STANLEY	Andy!
L369544	u6499	m432	ANDY	Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
L370046	u6499	m432	ANDY	These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
L370045	u6508	m432	MAYNARD	Cue the commercial!
L370040	u6508	m432	MAYNARD	Okay, great!  So let's reset!
L370039	u6499	m432	ANDY	Right...
L369741	u6499	m432	ANDY	Deal.
L369740	u6508	m432	MAYNARD	Ten.
L369739	u6499	m432	ANDY	Twenty!
L369738	u6508	m432	MAYNARD	Five.
L369737	u6499	m432	ANDY	But it's only for thirty seconds!
L369736	u6508	m432	MAYNARD	Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
L369735	u6499	m432	ANDY	But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
L369734	u6508	m432	MAYNARD	Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
L369753	u6499	m432	ANDY	I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
L369752	u6509	m432	MIMI	I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
L369751	u6499	m432	ANDY	What do you mean?
L369750	u6509	m432	MIMI	I don't wanna talk about it!
L369749	u6499	m432	ANDY	No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
L369748	u6509	m432	MIMI	What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
L369747	u6499	m432	ANDY	Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
L369746	u6509	m432	MIMI	Excuse me -- ?
L370210	u6499	m432	ANDY	Okay.  You're probably right.
L370209	u6506	m432	LYNNE	You're NOT DYING!
L370208	u6499	m432	ANDY	Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
L370207	u6506	m432	LYNNE	How can you be so casual??!
L370201	u6499	m432	ANDY	No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
L370200	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Have you told your family?
L370199	u6499	m432	ANDY	They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
L370198	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
L370155	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Andy... there is no real you.
L370154	u6499	m432	ANDY	You don't know the real me.
L370153	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
L370152	u6499	m432	ANDY	I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
L370151	u6506	m432	LYNNE	I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
L370150	u6499	m432	ANDY	Oh, it's open.
L370149	u6506	m432	LYNNE	It's me.
L370148	u6499	m432	ANDY	Go away.
L369995	u6499	m432	ANDY	I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
L369994	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
L369993	u6499	m432	ANDY	I can shtop whenever I want...
L369992	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
L369979	u6506	m432	LYNNE	No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
L369978	u6499	m432	ANDY	Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
L369975	u6499	m432	ANDY	If you want...
L369974	u6506	m432	LYNNE	And all this will be for real?
L369973	u6499	m432	ANDY	Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
L369972	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Why Memphis?
L369971	u6499	m432	ANDY	Yes.
L369970	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
L369969	u6499	m432	ANDY	Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
L369968	u6506	m432	LYNNE	I'm here, ain't I?
L369967	u6499	m432	ANDY	Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
L369966	u6506	m432	LYNNE	You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
L369965	u6499	m432	ANDY	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
L369964	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
L369962	u6499	m432	ANDY	"Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through ""On Golden Pond."""
L369961	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Andy, the theater's that way!
L369960	u6499	m432	ANDY	I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
L369959	u6506	m432	LYNNE	No thanks.
L369958	u6499	m432	ANDY	Popcorn?
L369957	u6499	m432	ANDY	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
L369956	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Hi... am I late?
L369955	u6499	m432	ANDY	Hi...
L369954	u6499	m432	ANDY	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
L369953	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
L369951	u6499	m432	ANDY	"Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through ""On Golden Pond."""
L369950	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Andy, the theater's that way!
L369949	u6499	m432	ANDY	I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
L369948	u6506	m432	LYNNE	No thanks.
L369947	u6499	m432	ANDY	Popcorn?
L369946	u6499	m432	ANDY	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
L369945	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Hi... am I late?
L369944	u6499	m432	ANDY	Hi...
L369934	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
L369933	u6499	m432	ANDY	Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
L369932	u6506	m432	LYNNE	Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
L369931	u6499	m432	ANDY	Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
L370032	u6499	m432	ANDY	DON'T TOUCH ME!
L370031	u6503	m432	JACK BURNS	GET OFF!
L370030	u6499	m432	ANDY	I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
L370029	u6503	m432	JACK BURNS	Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
L370005	u6499	m432	ANDY	But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
L370004	u6503	m432	JACK BURNS	Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
L370003	u6499	m432	ANDY	You're not listening to me --
L370002	u6503	m432	JACK BURNS	"Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  ""Maui?  ""Wowie!"""
L370001	u6499	m432	ANDY	I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
L370120	u6499	m432	ANDY	And you're just poor white trash!
L370119	u6505	m432	LAWLER	Then your father's a wimp.
L370118	u6499	m432	ANDY	My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
L370117	u6505	m432	LAWLER	You're a wimp.
L370116	u6499	m432	ANDY	T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
L370112	u6499	m432	ANDY	And you're just poor white trash!
L370111	u6505	m432	LAWLER	Then your father's a wimp.
L370110	u6499	m432	ANDY	My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
L370109	u6505	m432	LAWLER	You're a wimp.
L370108	u6499	m432	ANDY	T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
L370251	u6499	m432	ANDY	No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
L370250	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	"And you say, ""Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?""  And he says, ""Cancer!"""
L370249	u6499	m432	ANDY	"Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!"
L370248	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
L370247	u6499	m432	ANDY	This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
L370182	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	"Yeah, exactly -- ""was""!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???"
L370181	u6499	m432	ANDY	I was very original!
L370178	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
L370177	u6499	m432	ANDY	Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
L370176	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
L370175	u6499	m432	ANDY	I, I was asked to do this material - -
L370174	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
L370173	u6499	m432	ANDY	Sir, do you have a problem?
L370095	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	It's working for Elvis.
L370094	u6499	m432	ANDY	It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
L370093	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi...
L369919	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
L369918	u6499	m432	ANDY	You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
L369917	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	What is this, World War Two...?
L369916	u6499	m432	ANDY	Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
L369881	u6499	m432	ANDY	Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
L369880	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?
L369814	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
L369813	u6499	m432	ANDY	It's so dirty.
L369812	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	"She'll say, ""Now my son is a man."""
L369811	u6499	m432	ANDY	I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
L369783	u6499	m432	ANDY	They're asking for it.
L369782	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	No!  Andy, don't do it --
L369781	u6499	m432	ANDY	Give me the book.
L369723	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
L369722	u6499	m432	ANDY	So?  What do they know?
L369721	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!

L369705	u6499	m432	ANDY	Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
L369704	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Hey Andy, good show.
L370147	u6514	m432	YOGI	Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
L370146	u6499	m432	ANDY	So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
L370145	u6514	m432	YOGI	It is apparently not working.
L370144	u6499	m432	ANDY	Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
L370142	u6514	m432	YOGI	The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
L370141	u6499	m432	ANDY	Philosophically?
L370140	u6514	m432	YOGI	Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
L370139	u6499	m432	ANDY	Why??  I... I attend every year.
L370138	u6514	m432	YOGI	This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
L370137	u6499	m432	ANDY	Yes, your Holiness?
L370136	u6514	m432	YOGI	Excuse me, Andy...
L369629	u6514	m432	YOGI	We are all impressed.
L369628	u6499	m432	ANDY	I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
L369627	u6514	m432	YOGI	Goals are important.
L369626	u6499	m432	ANDY	Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
L369625	u6514	m432	YOGI	Are you at peace with your family?
L370091	u6499	m432	ANDY	Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
L370090	u6510	m432	OLD DOCTOR	It's probably just a strained muscle.
L370089	u6499	m432	ANDY	But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
L370088	u6510	m432	OLD DOCTOR	Positive.
L370087	u6499	m432	ANDY	Are you sure?
L370086	u6510	m432	OLD DOCTOR	I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
L369897	u6500	m432	BOOKER	Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
L369896	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
L369895	u6500	m432	BOOKER	Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
L369894	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
L369891	u6500	m432	BOOKER	I'll take my chances!!
L369890	u6502	m432	GEORGE	No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
L369889	u6500	m432	BOOKER	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
L369888	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
L369887	u6500	m432	BOOKER	Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
L369886	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
L369885	u6500	m432	BOOKER	Oh.
L369884	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.

L369854	u6513	m432	TONY CLIFTON	I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --

L369846	u6501	m432	ED	Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
L369845	u6513	m432	TONY CLIFTON	Burlesque?
L369617	u6513	m432	TONY CLIFTON	Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!

L369615	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
L369614	u6513	m432	TONY CLIFTON	Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
L369613	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Can I help you with something?

L370306	u6502	m432	GEORGE	It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
L370205	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
L370204	u6502	m432	GEORGE	If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
L370192	u6502	m432	GEORGE	FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
L370191	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
L370180	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	I used to think you were original.
L370179	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Why...?  Andy, why...?
L370097	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
L370096	u6502	m432	GEORGE	"Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  ""It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."""
L369912	u6502	m432	GEORGE	But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
L369911	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
L369910	u6502	m432	GEORGE	So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
L369810	u6502	m432	GEORGE	Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
L369809	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
L369808	u6502	m432	GEORGE	I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
L369708	u6515	m432	ZMUDA	Don't believe everything you hear.
L369707	u6502	m432	GEORGE	So your name's not Gorsky.

L383443	u6593	m439	BILLY	No, I'm not afraid.
L383480	u6601	m439	TEX	Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
L383479	u6593	m439	BILLY	Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
L383478	u6601	m439	TEX	Lucky girl.
L383477	u6593	m439	BILLY	She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
L383476	u6593	m439	BILLY	...She was on the plane.
L383475	u6601	m439	TEX	Girlfriend?
L383474	u6601	m439	TEX	Be tough on 'em.

L383470	u6601	m439	TEX	Got a family back there?
L383469	u6593	m439	BILLY	I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
L383468	u6601	m439	TEX	Beats working.
L383467	u6593	m439	BILLY	Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
L383466	u6601	m439	TEX	How much did you figure to make?
L383465	u6593	m439	BILLY	Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
L383464	u6601	m439	TEX	How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
L383463	u6601	m439	TEX	Something like that. Cigarette?
L383462	u6593	m439	BILLY	...are you with the Consulate?
L383461	u6593	m439	BILLY	I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
L383460	u6601	m439	TEX	Just what?
L383459	u6593	m439	BILLY	But just...
L383458	u6601	m439	TEX	Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
L383455	u6593	m439	BILLY	But didn't have heroin.
L383454	u6601	m439	TEX	Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
L383453	u6593	m439	BILLY	Stupid.
L383452	u6601	m439	TEX	You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
L383562	u6597	m439	ERICH	Seven years...

L383560	u6597	m439	ERICH	You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
L383558	u6597	m439	ERICH	Aslan, there... 
L383557	u6593	m439	BILLY	He wasn't even in the car?
L383556	u6597	m439	ERICH	But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
L383555	u6593	m439	BILLY	That doesn't seem so bad.
L383554	u6597	m439	ERICH	"There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all ""sula-bula"" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months..."
L383553	u6593	m439	BILLY	It's not fair!
L383552	u6597	m439	ERICH	A hundred grams.

L383549	u6593	m439	BILLY	What they give you?
L383548	u6597	m439	ERICH	Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
L383547	u6593	m439	BILLY	And you?
L383543	u6593	m439	BILLY	What did he do?
L383542	u6597	m439	ERICH	New people sometimes get on his nerves.
L383516	u6593	m439	BILLY	Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
L383515	u6597	m439	ERICH	Feeling all right?
L383512	u6593	m439	BILLY	I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
L383511	u6597	m439	ERICH	Just Erich.
L383507	u6593	m439	BILLY	About as good as it looks.

L383743	u6593	m439	BILLY	And?
L383742	u6594	m439	DAVIS	The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
L383741	u6593	m439	BILLY	What do you mean?
L383740	u6594	m439	DAVIS	No... It looks like your going to have a new court.

L383820	u6593	m439	BILLY	We go back.

L383709	u6593	m439	BILLY	Where is it?
L383708	u6599	m439	MAX	Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
L383707	u6593	m439	BILLY	Section 13?
L383706	u6599	m439	MAX	You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
L383698	u6599	m439	MAX	I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
L383697	u6593	m439	BILLY	But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
L383575	u6593	m439	BILLY	What's that?
L383574	u6599	m439	MAX	Get the... midnight... express.
L383573	u6593	m439	BILLY	What do you mean?
L383572	u6599	m439	MAX	Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
L383928	u6593	m439	BILLY	Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
L383927	u6600	m439	SUSAN	Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
L383410	u6593	m439	BILLY	For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!

L383405	u6600	m439	SUSAN	Billy, what's the matter?
L383399	u6593	m439	BILLY	You're right.
L383398	u6600	m439	SUSAN	You can't take anything seriously.
L383397	u6593	m439	BILLY	Never was anybody like you...
L383380	u6593	m439	BILLY	Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
L383379	u6600	m439	SUSAN	And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
L383378	u6593	m439	BILLY	I think I've been poisoned.
L383788	u6593	m439	BILLY	I don't hear you bitch about the money.
L383787	u6603	m439	ZIAT	Work, work, work, that's all do

L383681	u6603	m439	ZIAT	You 'Merican.  You don't know.
L383680	u6593	m439	BILLY	That's a great philosophy.
L383679	u6603	m439	ZIAT	Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
L383678	u6593	m439	BILLY	Learn what?
L383677	u6603	m439	ZIAT	Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
L383676	u6593	m439	BILLY	Know what?
L383674	u6593	m439	BILLY	Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
L383673	u6603	m439	ZIAT	I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
L383672	u6593	m439	BILLY	But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
L383671	u6603	m439	ZIAT	Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
L383670	u6593	m439	BILLY	You're ayip!
L383669	u6603	m439	ZIAT	Cat, ah!  Ayip!
L383668	u6593	m439	BILLY	What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
L383616	u6593	m439	BILLY	Did you ask for bail?
L383615	u6602	m439	YESIL	It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
L383614	u6593	m439	BILLY	What'd the Prosecutor say?
L383592	u6593	m439	BILLY	If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
L383591	u6602	m439	YESIL	You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
L383590	u6602	m439	YESIL	I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
L383589	u6593	m439	BILLY	Mr. Yesil.
L383588	u6602	m439	YESIL	Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
L383571	u6599	m439	MAX	Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
L383570	u6597	m439	ERICH	Who got the Frenchman out?
L383569	u6599	m439	MAX	What lawyer?
L383568	u6597	m439	ERICH	The lawyer?
L383567	u6599	m439	MAX	Who?
L383566	u6597	m439	ERICH	His name?
L383565	u6599	m439	MAX	Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
L383564	u6597	m439	ERICH	Lawyers?
L396906	u6696	m446	BROWN	She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
L396905	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
L396904	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
L396903	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	It's what the maids are for.
L396902	u6696	m446	BROWN	I can't move to tidy.
L396901	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	The place is a mess.
L396900	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
L396899	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You should have someone look after you.
L396898	u6696	m446	BROWN	What do you take me for?
L396897	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Be careful who sees it.
L396896	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's a diary.
L396895	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	What's this?
L396815	u6696	m446	BROWN	Get out.  Out!
L396814	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
L396813	u6696	m446	BROWN	She means it.
L396812	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Aye.
L396811	u6696	m446	BROWN	My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
L396809	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
L396808	u6696	m446	BROWN	You know nothing about her!
L396807	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
L396806	u6696	m446	BROWN	You watch your tongue.
L396805	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
L396804	u6696	m446	BROWN	Oh, I'm much more than that.
L396803	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
L396802	u6696	m446	BROWN	I can't let her down now, Archie.
L396801	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She'll get over it.
L396800	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll be worried about me.
L396799	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
L396798	u6696	m446	BROWN	I've got my duties to attend to.
L396797	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You've got three broken ribs, man!
L396796	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm getting dressed.
L396795	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	What are you doing?!
L396794	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
L396793	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
L396792	u6696	m446	BROWN	And she sent no word down?
L396564	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
L396563	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
L396562	u6696	m446	BROWN	But I'm the only one she trusts.
L396561	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
L396560	u6696	m446	BROWN	The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
L396559	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	John, it's not your problem what she eats.
L396558	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, but will they?
L396557	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
L396556	u6696	m446	BROWN	One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
L396455	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
L396454	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
L396453	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	The good-looking one.
L396452	u6696	m446	BROWN	Which one of us is she flirting with?
L396451	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
L396450	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm not sure I do, Archie.
L396449	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You know what I mean.
L396448	u6696	m446	BROWN	What?
L396447	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
L396446	u6696	m446	BROWN	She loved him.
L396445	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
L396444	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's only grief makes her like she is.
L396443	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She's hardly a full hamper herself.
L396442	u6696	m446	BROWN	If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
L396441	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	It's better than shovelling horse shit.
L396440	u6696	m446	BROWN	Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
L396439	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	That's pretty good for a ghillie.
L396438	u6696	m446	BROWN	Sixty.
L396437	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	How about yourself?
L396436	u6696	m446	BROWN	Not bad, not bad.
L396435	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Seventy a year.
L396434	u6696	m446	BROWN	How much?
L396433	u6696	m446	BROWN	I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
L396432	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
L396431	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Not down south you don't.
L396430	u6696	m446	BROWN	I speak as I find, Archie.
L396429	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
L396428	u6696	m446	BROWN	I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
L396427	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
L396426	u6696	m446	BROWN	So?
L396886	u6696	m446	BROWN	Kitchen and lower house.
L396885	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	Checked and locked, sir.
L396884	u6696	m446	BROWN	Louder, girl!
L396883	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	Checked and locked, sir.
L396511	u6696	m446	BROWN	You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
L396510	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	I hope to go up next year.
L396509	u6696	m446	BROWN	Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
L396508	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	Mary Taylor, sir.
L396507	u6696	m446	BROWN	What's your name?
L396781	u6696	m446	BROWN	Are you all right, Barney?
L396780	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Yeah.
L396779	u6696	m446	BROWN	Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
L396778	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Yeah.
L396777	u6696	m446	BROWN	Good man.  And is she all right?
L396776	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Yeah, yeah, I did.
L396775	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
L396774	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
L396773	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Mr Brown, sir --
L396772	u6696	m446	BROWN	Hey, Barney.
L396659	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Quite.
L396658	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
L396657	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I'm flattered you think so.
L396656	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
L396655	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	A situation?
L396654	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
L396653	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I see.
L396652	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
L396651	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Of course.
L396650	u6694	m446	BERTIE	My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
L396649	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
L396648	u6694	m446	BERTIE	No doubt you've heard the rumors.
L396647	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I don't think I've had that pleasure.
L396646	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
L396645	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
L396644	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
L396758	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Out of my way!
L396757	u6696	m446	BROWN	Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
L396756	u6694	m446	BERTIE	The future King!
L396755	u6696	m446	BROWN	Whom you address.
L396754	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Do you know who you address, sir?
L396753	u6696	m446	BROWN	I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
L396752	u6694	m446	BERTIE	What did you say?
L396751	u6696	m446	BROWN	Are you deaf as well as stupid?
L396750	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
L396749	u6696	m446	BROWN	She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
L396748	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Convey her a message.
L396747	u6696	m446	BROWN	She's busy.
L396746	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I wish to see my mother.
L396606	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
L396605	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's the Queen's decision.
L396604	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
L396603	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	And that is my last word on the matter.
L396602	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Mama...
L396601	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
L396600	u6694	m446	BERTIE	But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
L396599	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	It is quite late enough.
L396598	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
L396597	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
L396596	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
L396536	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
L396535	u6694	m446	BERTIE	If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
L396534	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
L396533	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Mother....
L396526	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
L396525	u6694	m446	BERTIE	It's so infernally cold in here.
L396524	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
L396523	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
L396522	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Gesture?
L396888	u6696	m446	BROWN	Back and upper corridors.
L396887	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	Checked and locked, sir.
L396690	u6696	m446	BROWN	You'll talk when I'm finished!
L396689	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	We --
L396688	u6696	m446	BROWN	What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
L396504	u6696	m446	BROWN	That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
L396503	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
L396502	u6696	m446	BROWN	My own.
L396501	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	By whose authority?
L396500	u6696	m446	BROWN	Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
L396499	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
L396996	u6696	m446	BROWN	I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
L396995	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
L396702	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
L396701	u6696	m446	BROWN	Nobody has any rights over me.
L396700	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
L396699	u6696	m446	BROWN	This is a slur on her good name.
L396698	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
L396697	u6696	m446	BROWN	Don't think I can't persuade her.
L396696	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
L396695	u6696	m446	BROWN	If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
L396593	u6696	m446	BROWN	It can wait.  Anything else?
L396592	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	There are important papers from --
L396591	u6696	m446	BROWN	That can wait till the weekend.
L396590	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
L396589	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
L396478	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Yes, it most certainly is!
L396477	u6696	m446	BROWN	Is that the Queen's request?
L396476	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Go inside at once.
L396475	u6696	m446	BROWN	Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
L396474	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
L396473	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I beg your pardon?
L396472	u6696	m446	BROWN	No.
L396471	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
L396470	u6696	m446	BROWN	I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
L396469	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
L396468	u6696	m446	BROWN	Awaiting my orders.
L396403	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Yes.  I do.
L396402	u6696	m446	BROWN	Do you?
L396401	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
L396400	u6696	m446	BROWN	I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
L396399	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
L396398	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, do.
L396397	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
L396396	u6696	m446	BROWN	That's not good enough.
L396395	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
L396394	u6696	m446	BROWN	I need a man who knows where I am.
L396393	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Her Highness' Equerry.
L396392	u6696	m446	BROWN	Who'll bring it to me?
L396391	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	You'll be sent a message.
L396390	u6696	m446	BROWN	How will I know what she requires?
L396389	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I'm sorry?
L396388	u6696	m446	BROWN	How will I know?
L396387	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
L396956	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
L396955	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll think I betrayed her.
L396954	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	In time, she will.
L396953	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll never understand it.
L396952	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	For once in my life, I am not the issue.
L396951	u6696	m446	BROWN	I promised to protect her from people like you.
L396950	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	No love.
L396949	u6696	m446	BROWN	No loyalty.
L396948	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The greasy pole.
L396947	u6696	m446	BROWN	Too busy looking after themselves.
L396946	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	They aren't as watchful as you.
L396945	u6696	m446	BROWN	The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
L396944	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	See what?
L396943	u6696	m446	BROWN	They don't see it.
L396942	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	She trusts you, John.
L396941	u6696	m446	BROWN	Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
L396940	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
L396939	u6696	m446	BROWN	So...?
L396938	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
L396937	u6696	m446	BROWN	Why do you think I keep her here?
L396936	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
L396934	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	No other aspiration?
L396933	u6696	m446	BROWN	I said.  I serve the Queen.
L396932	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	But yourself?  What about John Brown?
L396931	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye.
L396930	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	For Her Majesty.
L396929	u6696	m446	BROWN	I do what I do.
L396928	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
L396927	u6696	m446	BROWN	Why?
L396926	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Then I envy yo.
L396925	u6696	m446	BROWN	Maybe, once.
L396924	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Was there never ambition?
L396923	u6696	m446	BROWN	What I do, I do for my Queen.
L396922	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Surely --
L396921	u6696	m446	BROWN	I wouldn't know.
L396920	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
L396918	u6696	m446	BROWN	This is the top.
L396917	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Oh.
L396916	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm not married.
L396915	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
L396914	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's nothing.
L396913	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	You're injured.
L396912	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm fine.
L396911	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
L396910	u6696	m446	BROWN	I don't think about it.
L396909	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
L396908	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
L396907	u6696	m446	BROWN	You sent for me.
L396879	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Quite.
L396878	u6696	m446	BROWN	Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
L396876	u6696	m446	BROWN	If you hunt, you kill.
L396875	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
L396874	u6696	m446	BROWN	Dare say you can be taught.
L396873	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Occasionally.
L396872	u6696	m446	BROWN	Do you hunt?
L396871	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I am a blank sheet.
L396870	u6696	m446	BROWN	What do you know about the Highlands?
L396869	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
L396868	u6696	m446	BROWN	What brings you here?
L397018	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.  Yes it was.
L397017	u6696	m446	BROWN	Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
L397016	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
L396972	u6696	m446	BROWN	Because I have to! 
L396971	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then why send me back to them?!
L396970	u6696	m446	BROWN	-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
L396969	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
L396968	u6696	m446	BROWN	For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
L396967	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
L396966	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm breaking no promises!
L396965	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
L396964	u6696	m446	BROWN	Have I ever let you down before--?
L396963	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
L396962	u6696	m446	BROWN	If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
L396961	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
L396847	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
L396846	u6696	m446	BROWN	I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
L396845	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I do not accept.
L396844	u6696	m446	BROWN	Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
L396843	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes?
L396842	u6696	m446	BROWN	Ma'am?
L396841	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396840	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Has someone seen to those bruises?
L396839	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396838	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I was told you were in a fight.
L396837	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am?
L396836	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	John?
L396769	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
L396768	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
L396767	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
L396766	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Am I not safe enough with you, John?
L396765	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
L396764	u6696	m446	BROWN	I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
L396763	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Must they always follow us?
L396680	u6696	m446	BROWN	I heard something.
L396679	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is it, John?  John?
L396671	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye.
L396670	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	To keep out the cold.
L396669	u6696	m446	BROWN	We took a nip of whiskey.
L396615	u6696	m446	BROWN	Ah, well...
L396614	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
L396613	u6696	m446	BROWN	They're ready now.
L396585	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
L396584	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
L396583	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
L396582	u6696	m446	BROWN	Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
L396581	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
L396580	u6696	m446	BROWN	I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
L396579	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
L396578	u6696	m446	BROWN	That doesn't make him an expert.
L396577	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
L396576	u6696	m446	BROWN	What does he know about the Highlands?
L396575	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
L396574	u6696	m446	BROWN	Who by?
L396573	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I am told so.
L396572	u6696	m446	BROWN	Are they worth reading?
L396571	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	"I am thinking of publishing my ""Highland Journals."""
L396570	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
L396569	u6696	m446	BROWN	Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
L396568	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Those, over there, there.
L396567	u6696	m446	BROWN	What?
L396566	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What are those?
L396495	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.
L396494	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, ma'am.
L396493	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
L396492	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
L396491	u6696	m446	BROWN	If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
L396489	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	He thought so, yes.
L396488	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's a fine spot, ma'am.
L396487	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
L396486	u6696	m446	BROWN	And I intend to be there when she's ready.
L396485	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
L396484	u6696	m446	BROWN	Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
L396483	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then why do you persist in doing it?
L396482	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396481	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
L396480	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396479	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Mr Brown.
L396422	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396421	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.  That will be company for you.
L396420	u6696	m446	BROWN	Archie.
L396419	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
L396418	u6696	m446	BROWN	I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
L396417	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
L396416	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm glad of it.
L396415	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
L396414	u6696	m446	BROWN	She's well, too.
L396413	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	And the pony?
L396412	u6696	m446	BROWN	I am.
L396411	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You are well?
L396410	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, ma'am.
L396409	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You are here safely.
L396408	u6696	m446	BROWN	Ma'am.
L396407	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Mr Brown.
L396733	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Oh, several things.
L396732	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	What can we do?
L396725	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	I beg your pardon?
L396724	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
L396723	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	I came as quickly as I could.
L396722	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
L396721	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
L396867	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
L396866	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Yes.
L396865	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	This is my good John Brown.
L396863	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	No, ma'am.
L396862	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
L396861	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
L396860	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
L396859	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
L396858	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Is that not enough?
L396857	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
L396856	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then they may read about me.
L396854	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
L396853	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
L396720	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	"I was trying to imagine ""rather upset."""
L396719	u6703	m446	STANLEY	The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
L396718	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	What's her excuse this time?
L396717	u6703	m446	STANLEY	She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
L396716	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
L396715	u6703	m446	STANLEY	It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
L396714	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Mrs Brown.
L396713	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Who?
L396712	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
L396711	u6703	m446	STANLEY	You can't know that for sure.
L396710	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	We're going to lose.
L396662	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	To know when he'll be king.
L396661	u6703	m446	STANLEY	What did he want?
L396628	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I hope he got his mother's permission.
L396627	u6703	m446	STANLEY	I see the Prince of Wales is here.
L396554	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	We'll see which way the wind blows.
L396553	u6703	m446	STANLEY	So?
L396552	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
L396551	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
L396550	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
L396549	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The question is, do we need her?
L396548	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Well, both.
L396547	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
L396546	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Should we take it seriously?
L397035	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	No, indeed.
L397034	u6699	m446	JENNER	Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
L397033	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
L397032	u6699	m446	JENNER	Where did you find it by the way?
L397031	u6699	m446	JENNER	Of course.
L397030	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
L397029	u6699	m446	JENNER	Yes.
L397028	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
L397027	u6699	m446	JENNER	Dear oh dear.
L397026	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
L397025	u6699	m446	JENNER	A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
L397024	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Not too protracted, I hope.
L397023	u6699	m446	JENNER	Erysipelas.
L396675	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	No, she wasn't.
L396674	u6699	m446	JENNER	A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
L396375	u6699	m446	JENNER	Excellent!
L396374	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	A fine choice, sir.
L396988	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	How ill is he?
L396987	u6699	m446	JENNER	I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
L396986	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why was I not informed?
L396985	u6699	m446	JENNER	The same, your Majesty.
L396984	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
L396532	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
L396531	u6699	m446	JENNER	Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
L396530	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why am I being lectured in this way?!
L396529	u6699	m446	JENNER	Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
L396528	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Cold is good!
L396527	u6699	m446	JENNER	I'm sorry, ma'am?
L396383	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Whom?
L396382	u6699	m446	JENNER	We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
L397015	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why was I not told earlier?
L397014	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	A few days, ma'am.
L397013	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	How long has he been this sick?
L396790	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
L396789	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Has he been hurt?
L396788	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I understand he was in a fight.
L396787	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Unwell?
L396786	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
L396785	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why?
L396784	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
L396783	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Well?
L396462	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
L396461	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
L396460	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
L396459	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is he doing there?
L396458	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
L396381	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	Yes, ma'am.
L396380	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Just them?
L396379	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
L396833	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Ma'am.
L396832	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
L396831	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Ma'am?
L396826	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
L396825	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What do they want?
L396824	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
L396823	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
L396822	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	From whom?
L396821	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I have a letter, ma'am.
L396820	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is it?
L396819	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	There is one other matter.
L396744	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
L396743	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Your Majesty --
L396742	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
L396741	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
L396740	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why not?
L396739	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I have no idea.
L396738	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Who told them that?
L396736	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Read it!
L396735	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Again?
L396734	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Read it.
L396668	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	And now I am back.
L396667	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	We were expecting you to return by six.
L396666	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
L396517	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No.  I shall be out walking.
L396516	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
L396515	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why?
L396514	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
L396466	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Of course, at once.
L396465	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Please make sure it does not happen again.
L396464	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
L396463	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
L396983	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
L396982	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is the matter with him?
L396981	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
L396980	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then why are you not with him?
L396979	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	He is sick, ma'am.
L396978	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why is he not here?
L396977	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
L396976	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Where is my son?
L396385	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	Yes, ma'am.
L396384	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
L486268	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
L486267	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Now you're back.
L486266	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
L486265	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
L486264	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
L486263	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Oskar - my friend Lena.
L485991	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
L485990	u7451	m504	CLERK	The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
L485989	u7451	m504	CLERK	Klaus Tauber.
L485988	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
L485987	u7451	m504	CLERK	Sir, the list is correct.
L485986	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's your name?
L485985	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm talking to a clerk.
L485984	u7451	m504	CLERK	He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
L485983	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, let's find him.
L485982	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He is.
L485981	u7451	m504	CLERK	Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
L485980	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
L485882	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's up to you.
L485881	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Should I stay?
L485880	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's a beautiful city.
L485879	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Should I stay?
L485878	u7452	m504	EMILIE	I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
L485877	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What?
L485875	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	War.
L485874	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Luck.
L485872	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
L485871	u7452	m504	EMILIE	It's not a charade, all this?
L485863	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
L485862	u7452	m504	EMILIE	I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
L485861	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What -
L485860	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Oskar, please -
L485859	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You know what, you'd like her.
L486337	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
L486336	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	In Breslau.
L486335	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	All right, okay, let's talk.
L486334	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
L486333	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
L486332	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm sorry to hear that.
L486331	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
L486477	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
L486476	u7454	m504	GOETH	Where are the guards?
L486286	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
L486285	u7454	m504	GOETH	Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
L486284	u7454	m504	GOETH	You did, but you didn't.
L486283	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I just told you.
L486282	u7454	m504	GOETH	If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
L486280	u7454	m504	GOETH	Yeah, sure.
L486279	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
L486278	u7454	m504	GOETH	You're not telling me something.
L486277	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Look -
L486276	u7454	m504	GOETH	"Oh, this is ""good business"" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense."
L486275	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's good business.
L486274	u7454	m504	GOETH	What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
L486273	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	These people, my people, I want my people.
L486272	u7454	m504	GOETH	You want these people.
L486255	u7454	m504	GOETH	I don't know.  Soon.
L486254	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	When?
L486253	u7454	m504	GOETH	They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
L486252	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You took my workers.
L486214	u7454	m504	GOETH	I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
L486213	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's going on?
L486212	u7454	m504	GOETH	I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
L486096	u7454	m504	GOETH	I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
L486095	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
L486094	u7454	m504	GOETH	He's important to my business.
L486093	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
L486091	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I pay you too much.
L486090	u7454	m504	GOETH	It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
L486064	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
L486063	u7454	m504	GOETH	Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
L486061	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	True.
L486060	u7454	m504	GOETH	That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
L486059	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah, what's that?
L486058	u7454	m504	GOETH	Scherner told me something else about you.
L486057	u7454	m504	GOETH	Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
L486056	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's bad business.
L486055	u7454	m504	GOETH	We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
L486054	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
L486053	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They're mine!
L486052	u7454	m504	GOETH	They're not gone, they're here.
L486051	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
L486049	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
L486048	u7454	m504	GOETH	He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
L486047	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You're kidding.
L486046	u7454	m504	GOETH	You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
L486039	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Good.
L486038	u7454	m504	GOETH	We started without you.
L486321	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
L486320	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What do I got for you?
L486319	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
L486318	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Of course I'm on it.
L486317	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
L485820	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Yeah, I can.
L485819	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
L485782	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Look it up.
L485781	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	This is not my problem.
L485780	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
L485779	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	So I'm responsible for the weather?
L485778	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
L485777	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	You asked for shoe polish.
L485776	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
L485775	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	What's that?
L485925	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	You're a good man.
L485924	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah, okay.
L485923	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	God bless you, sir.
L485922	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	That's great, thanks.
L485921	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
L485920	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	That's great.
L485919	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
L485918	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
L485917	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
L486527	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
L486526	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
L486525	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
L486524	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
L486523	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
L486522	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What are you doing?
L486521	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Things are great, things are great.
L486520	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Good.  How's it going?
L486394	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
L486393	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What's wrong with it?
L485904	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	She's good.
L485903	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
L485902	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Yeah.
L485901	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How you feeling, all right?
L485794	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
L485793	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	How many?
L485792	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Nice things cost money.
L485791	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
L485790	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	There's nothing in the stores.
L485789	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Like this?
L486451	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
L486450	u7458	m504	RASCH	Pistols?
L486449	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It kind of looks that way.
L486448	u7458	m504	RASCH	We're losing the war, aren't we.
L486447	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
L486442	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Wine?
L486441	u7458	m504	RASCH	Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
L486440	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I need a drink.
L486439	u7458	m504	RASCH	Thank you.
L486437	u7458	m504	RASCH	How do you do?
L486436	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
L486435	u7458	m504	RASCH	Oskar, good of you to come.
L486200	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
L486199	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
L486194	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
L486193	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
L486192	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	So I'll talk to him about it.
L486191	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
L485847	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
L485846	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	That'd be fine.
L485844	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
L485843	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	What others?
L485842	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
L485841	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
L486498	u7461	m504	STERN	You did so much.
L486497	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I didn't do enough.
L486496	u7461	m504	STERN	There will be generations because of what you did.
L486495	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
L486494	u7461	m504	STERN	Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
L486493	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
L486456	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, no, what, what is it?
L486455	u7461	m504	STERN	I'll talk to you later.
L486411	u7461	m504	STERN	You'll lose money.
L486410	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
L486409	u7461	m504	STERN	I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
L486406	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No?
L486405	u7461	m504	STERN	There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
L486404	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
L486403	u7461	m504	STERN	They're withholding payment.
L486402	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
L486399	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They arrived, can you believe it?
L486398	u7461	m504	STERN	They arrived.
L486397	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Stern.
L486396	u7461	m504	STERN	We need to talk.
L486389	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yes.
L486388	u7461	m504	STERN	That's very generous of you.
L486299	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
L486298	u7461	m504	STERN	Eight hundred, give or take.
L486295	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	More.
L486294	u7461	m504	STERN	Four hundred, four fifty -
L486188	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
L486187	u7461	m504	STERN	I think it's too late.
L486186	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'll talk to him.
L486161	u7461	m504	STERN	There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
L486160	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
L486159	u7461	m504	STERN	And killing.
L486158	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
L486157	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
L486156	u7461	m504	STERN	What other point is -
L486155	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
L486154	u7461	m504	STERN	Are you losing money?
L486153	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
L486103	u7461	m504	STERN	Oskar -
L486102	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I got to go, I'll see you.
L486101	u7461	m504	STERN	Thank you.
L486100	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
L485955	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Ah, yes.
L485954	u7461	m504	STERN	Christmas presents.
L485953	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
L485932	u7461	m504	STERN	Do what?
L485931	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Don't ever do that to me again.
L485914	u7461	m504	STERN	There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
L485913	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What?
L485912	u7461	m504	STERN	The war could end.
L485911	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Any reason to think next month will be worse?
L485910	u7461	m504	STERN	Yes.
L485909	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Better this month than last?
L485908	u7461	m504	STERN	Yes.
L485907	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
L485833	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
L485832	u7461	m504	STERN	The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
L485831	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
L485774	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They should be.
L485773	u7461	m504	STERN	I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
L485772	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Something they can hold in their hands.
L485771	u7461	m504	STERN	Pots and pans.
L485770	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
L485769	u7461	m504	STERN	Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
L485768	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Jews, yeah.  Investors.
L485766	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
L485765	u7461	m504	STERN	"Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a ""pleasure."""
L485763	u7461	m504	STERN	I think most people right now have other priorities.
L485762	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
L485759	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
L485758	u7461	m504	STERN	I was just the accountant.
L486196	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
L486195	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	He's stealing from you, Oskar.
L486190	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
L486189	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
L485942	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
L485941	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
L485939	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	No.
L485938	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Would it do any good?
L485937	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
L485936	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
L485935	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
L599191	u8339	m566	BENEK	Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
L599190	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
L599189	u8339	m566	BENEK	A beauty. Who is she?
L599188	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes.
L599187	u8339	m566	BENEK	Someone you know?
L599179	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's like this... I...we...all of them.
L599178	u8339	m566	BENEK	Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
L599007	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Who wants me to stop?
L599006	u8339	m566	BENEK	I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
L599347	u8340	m566	DOROTA	He's still a doctor.
L599346	u8351	m566	MICHAL	Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
L599345	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
L599344	u8351	m566	MICHAL	You can't, it's too dangerous.
L599343	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I'm going to get a doctor.
L599314	u8351	m566	MICHAL	Oh, yes. I remember.
L599313	u8340	m566	DOROTA	This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
L599312	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
L599311	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	When's your baby due?
L599310	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Dead.
L599309	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	And how's Yurek?
L599308	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Just over a year.
L599307	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How long have you been married?
L599306	u8340	m566	DOROTA	He'll be here soon.
L599305	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
L599304	u8340	m566	DOROTA	He'll be back before curfew.
L599303	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I need help.
L599302	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
L599301	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
L599300	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Sit.
L599299	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Come in! come in!
L599298	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Dorota.
L599297	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Wladyslaw Szpilman.
L598968	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'll see you...soon.
L598967	u8340	m566	DOROTA	That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
L598966	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Don't worry, it won't last long.
L598965	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
L598964	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How are you doing?
L598963	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
L598962	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Dorota!
L598932	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Wladek, please.
L598931	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
L598929	u8340	m566	DOROTA	No one plays Chopin like you.
L598928	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Wladek, please.
L598927	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
L598926	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
L598925	u8340	m566	DOROTA	Really?
L598924	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
L598923	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
L598840	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's nothing.
L598839	u8340	m566	DOROTA	My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
L598838	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Who are you?
L598837	u8340	m566	DOROTA	I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
L598836	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Hello.
L599045	u8341	m566	FATHER	American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
L599044	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	For what? For my tie?
L598970	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How will we sleep?
L598969	u8341	m566	FATHER	To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
L598937	u8341	m566	FATHER	Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
L598936	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Let me see this.
L598915	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Let's find out.
L598914	u8341	m566	FATHER	Will I still be able to play?
L598854	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What are you doing?
L598853	u8341	m566	FATHER	What did I tell you?
L599288	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
L599287	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
L599286	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
L599285	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happened?
L599284	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	I'm on the run!
L599283	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happened?
L599282	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	Get your things together, you have to leave!
L599254	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	Here.
L599253	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
L599252	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	Must feel better this side of the wall.
L599249	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
L599248	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'll be fine.
L599247	u8342	m566	GEBCZYNSKI	It's not going to be very comfortable.
L599171	u8343	m566	HALINA	Thanks.
L599170	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	wish I knew you better.
L599169	u8343	m566	HALINA	What?
L599168	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Funny time to say this.
L599167	u8343	m566	HALINA	What?
L599166	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Halina?
L599053	u8343	m566	HALINA	They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
L599052	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Calm down, what, what is it?
L599051	u8343	m566	HALINA	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
L599050	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happened?
L598944	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What, I'm working, what?
L598943	u8343	m566	HALINA	Have you seen this?
L599074	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	People I know. They said you're an important man.
L599073	u8344	m566	HELLER	Who told you?
L599072	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
L599071	u8344	m566	HELLER	Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
L599070	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I've no money.
L599069	u8344	m566	HELLER	It costs.
L599068	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Can you help us?
L599067	u8344	m566	HELLER	Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
L599066	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Can you help?
L599065	u8344	m566	HELLER	Tough luck.
L599064	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Believe me, they've picked him up.
L599063	u8344	m566	HELLER	I haven't seen him.
L599062	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Henryk's in there.
L599004	u8344	m566	HELLER	I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
L599003	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Yes, please.
L599002	u8344	m566	HELLER	Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
L599001	u8345	m566	HENRYK	But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
L599000	u8344	m566	HELLER	Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
L598999	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
L598998	u8344	m566	HELLER	Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
L598997	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Who's recruiting?
L598996	u8344	m566	HELLER	We're recruiting.
L599042	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
L599041	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Boys, boys...
L599037	u8345	m566	HENRYK	What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
L599036	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Henryk, I said nothing bad.
L599031	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
L599030	u8352	m566	MOTHER	And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
L598992	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
L598991	u8345	m566	HENRYK	What's this about?
L598898	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Do they?
L598897	u8345	m566	HENRYK	The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
L598896	u8352	m566	MOTHER	What d'you mean, take the table away?
L598895	u8345	m566	HENRYK	And suppose they take the table away?
L599159	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Yes, that's why I brought it.
L599158	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Very appropriate.
L599157	u8345	m566	HENRYK	'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
L599156	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What are you reading?
L599099	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You'll be deported.
L599098	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Otherwise what?
L599097	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
L599096	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's that mean, no employment certificate?
L599095	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Hungry.
L599094	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's the matter? Are you sick?
L599093	u8345	m566	HENRYK	That's also my business.
L599092	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
L599091	u8345	m566	HENRYK	It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
L599090	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	They were taking you away.
L599089	u8345	m566	HENRYK	I can look after myself!
L599088	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
L599087	u8345	m566	HENRYK	What did you pay him?
L599086	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
L599085	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
L599084	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You're out, aren't you?
L599083	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
L599040	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
L599039	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
L599038	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's not funny.
L598978	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
L598977	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I know.
L598976	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
L598975	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	That's better than yesterday.
L598974	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
L598973	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You sell anything?
L598950	u8345	m566	HENRYK	No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
L598949	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
L598909	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Just shut up.
L598908	u8345	m566	HENRYK	A good place for what?  He's insane!
L598907	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
L598906	u8345	m566	HENRYK	We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
L598905	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	We use what?
L598904	u8345	m566	HENRYK	You know what we do? We use psychology.
L598903	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	That makes a change.
L598902	u8345	m566	HENRYK	No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
L598882	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It certainly was.
L598881	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Mama, that was a great dinner.
L598857	u8345	m566	HENRYK	Warsaw's not the only radio station.
L598856	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	They bombed us, we're off the air.
L599281	u8346	m566	JANINA	What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
L599280	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, but what good did it do?
L599279	u8346	m566	JANINA	They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
L599278	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, so did the Germans.
L599277	u8346	m566	JANINA	Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
L599276	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
L599275	u8346	m566	JANINA	No one thought they'd hold out so long.
L599113	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
L599112	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Can you help? I've no money...
L599111	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	I'm not, but Majorek is.
L599110	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
L599109	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Why didn't you come to me?
L599108	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
L599107	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
L599106	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
L599105	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
L599104	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Not this week.
L599103	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
L599028	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Toilets?
L599027	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
L599022	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	There are always notices going up.
L599021	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
L599020	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
L599019	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	But I want to help, I want to.
L599018	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
L599017	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Jehuda, give me something to do.
L599016	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
L599015	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
L599014	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
L599013	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	So, what's the news?
L599012	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
L599011	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You're amazing, Jehuda.
L599010	u8347	m566	JEHUDA	Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
L598922	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
L598921	u8348	m566	JUREK	...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
L598920	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
L598919	u8348	m566	JUREK	Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
L598918	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
L598917	u8348	m566	JUREK	Wladek! How are you?
L598916	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
L599271	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
L599270	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	I was listening, Kitten.
L599269	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
L599267	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Takes one to know one! Pig!
L599266	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	You're a dirty pig!
L599265	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Dirty pig!
L599264	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	Bitch!
L599263	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Pig!
L599262	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	Cow!
L599261	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Pig!
L599260	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
L599259	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	You know what? You treat me like dirt!
L599258	u8353	m566	PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
L599257	u8349	m566	KITTEN'S VOICE	Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
L599227	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
L599226	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	You made contact?
L599225	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
L599215	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
L599214	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
L599213	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
L599197	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	If you need help...
L599196	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
L599195	u8350	m566	MAJOREK	Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
L599194	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	How long have you been here?
L599125	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Stop it, Wladek.
L599124	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
L598876	u8352	m566	MOTHER	God forbid!
L598875	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
L598872	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'm not going anywhere.
L598871	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
L598870	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
L598861	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Out of Warsaw. Where?
L598860	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Out of Warsaw.
L598859	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Where are we going?
L598858	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
L598849	u8352	m566	MOTHER	I've been worried sick.
L598848	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	It's a little cut, nothing.
L598847	u8352	m566	MOTHER	Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
L599338	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
L599337	u8354	m566	SZALAS	You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
L599330	u8354	m566	SZALAS	Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
L599329	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Sorry, I don't remember.
L599328	u8354	m566	SZALAS	Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
L599327	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	No, I don't think so?
L599326	u8354	m566	SZALAS	You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
L599395	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
L599394	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Szpilman.
L599393	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
L599392	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
L599391	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
L599390	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What about you?
L599389	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
L599388	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I don't know how to thank you.
L599387	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Not yet.
L599386	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	Are the Russians here?
L599385	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	We're getting out.
L599384	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's happening?
L599382	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
L599381	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	What's all that gunfire?
L599376	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Show me.
L599375	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	In the attic.
L599374	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Where are you hiding?
L599370	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	A pianist.
L599369	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I am... I was a pianist.
L599368	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	What's your work?
L599367	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	Where do you live?
L599366	u8355	m566	SZPILMAN	I was... I was trying to open this tin.
L599365	u8356	m566	THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	What the hell are you doing?
