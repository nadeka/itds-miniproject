L384723	u2082	m135	BILLY	IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
L384722	u2079	m135	ADAM	WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
L384703	u2082	m135	BILLY	We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
L384702	u2079	m135	ADAM	Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
L384701	u2082	m135	BILLY	It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
L384697	u2082	m135	BILLY	Wait a second...  What time is it?
L384696	u2079	m135	ADAM	He's on us!!
L384686	u2082	m135	BILLY	Speed?
L384685	u2079	m135	ADAM	We've got him locked!
L384615	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	Zordon...  he's gone.
L384614	u2080	m135	AISHA	What?!
L384613	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
L384237	u2080	m135	AISHA	How can we reach Phaedos?
L384236	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
L384234	u2080	m135	AISHA	If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
L384233	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
L384227	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
L384226	u2080	m135	AISHA	Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
L384372	u2080	m135	AISHA	Stylin'!
L384371	u2084	m135	DULCEA	Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
L384370	u2084	m135	DULCEA	Now tell me... what do you see?
L384369	u2080	m135	AISHA	Wow.  Sand.
L384367	u2084	m135	DULCEA	It will not harm you.
L384366	u2080	m135	AISHA	Yeah, right.
L384365	u2084	m135	DULCEA	"In the language of the Nathadians, ""Nin"" stands for ""man"", ""jetti"" stands for ""animal"".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame."
L384362	u2080	m135	AISHA	Ah... sure.
L384361	u2084	m135	DULCEA	He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
L384351	u2084	m135	DULCEA	The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
L384350	u2080	m135	AISHA	So how can we get to it?
L384340	u2084	m135	DULCEA	They're called squirbs.
L384339	u2080	m135	AISHA	Is this... food!
L384669	u2080	m135	AISHA	OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
L384668	u2082	m135	BILLY	SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
L384589	u2082	m135	BILLY	I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
L384588	u2080	m135	AISHA	Release the power with the power.
L384559	u2082	m135	BILLY	There should be a way to open it.
L384558	u2080	m135	AISHA	We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
L384417	u2080	m135	AISHA	I've never been this sore in my life.
L384416	u2082	m135	BILLY	I can hardly walk...
L384213	u2082	m135	BILLY	Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
L384212	u2080	m135	AISHA	... What's happening to him?'
L384076	u2082	m135	BILLY	I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
L384075	u2080	m135	AISHA	I heard that!
L384688	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
L384687	u2080	m135	AISHA	1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
L384584	u2080	m135	AISHA	What does that mean?!
L384583	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Release the power WITH the power.
L384510	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
L384509	u2080	m135	AISHA	That's pretty bad.
L384179	u2080	m135	AISHA	Activating Power Beam!
L384178	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
L384176	u2092	m135	TOMMY	WHITE TIGER!
L384175	u2080	m135	AISHA	SABER TOOTH TIGER!
L384132	u2092	m135	TOMMY	... Let's take a look over there.
L384131	u2080	m135	AISHA	Anybody see anything?
L384717	u2094	m135	ZORDON	Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
L384716	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
L384490	u2094	m135	ZORDON	... I just pray we're not too late.
L384489	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
L384409	u2094	m135	ZORDON	... We must try to communicate with them.
L384408	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
L384407	u2094	m135	ZORDON	... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
L384152	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
L384151	u2094	m135	ZORDON	Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
L384095	u2094	m135	ZORDON	Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
L384094	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
L384093	u2094	m135	ZORDON	The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
L384092	u2081	m135	ALPHA 5	In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
L384502	u2084	m135	DULCEA	About twenty seconds in your time.
L384501	u2082	m135	BILLY	What's a Triac?
L384500	u2084	m135	DULCEA	It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
L384376	u2084	m135	DULCEA	Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
L384375	u2082	m135	BILLY	I see... a fox
L384349	u2084	m135	DULCEA	"In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the ""Nathadians"", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished."
L384348	u2082	m135	BILLY	Where did it originate?
L384347	u2084	m135	DULCEA	It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
L384654	u2087	m135	KIMBERLY	This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
L384653	u2082	m135	BILLY	All systems go!

L384581	u2087	m135	KIMBERLY	WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
L384580	u2082	m135	BILLY	Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
L384572	u2087	m135	KIMBERLY	I am the crane, agile and sublime!
L384571	u2082	m135	BILLY	I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
L384280	u2082	m135	BILLY	I think so.
L384279	u2087	m135	KIMBERLY	You okay?
L384172	u2082	m135	BILLY	TRICERATOPS!
L384171	u2087	m135	KIMBERLY	PTERODACTYL!

L384596	u2090	m135	ROCKY	NEW POWER COINS!!
L384561	u2090	m135	ROCKY	Release the power with the power.
L384560	u2082	m135	BILLY	... Nothing.
L384532	u2090	m135	ROCKY	We can take these guys!
L384531	u2082	m135	BILLY	That's the only way to the Monolith...
L384730	u2092	m135	TOMMY	WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
L384729	u2082	m135	BILLY	FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
L384721	u2092	m135	TOMMY	WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
L384720	u2082	m135	BILLY	IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!

L384677	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
L384676	u2082	m135	BILLY	Let's go after him!!
L384344	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
L384343	u2082	m135	BILLY	... Not bad.
L384709	u2091	m135	SKULL	BULK!!
L384708	u2083	m135	BULK	SKULL!!
L384604	u2091	m135	SKULL	A real shame.
L384603	u2083	m135	BULK	There goes the neighborhood.
L384336	u2083	m135	BULK	If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
L384335	u2091	m135	SKULL	Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
L384333	u2091	m135	SKULL	There's enough for everybody!
L384332	u2083	m135	BULK	Here you go!  No pushing!
L384298	u2083	m135	BULK	A stellar idea, Skull.
L384297	u2091	m135	SKULL	Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
L384082	u2091	m135	SKULL	We could smell it's breath.
L384081	u2083	m135	BULK	The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
L384037	u2091	m135	SKULL	Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
L384036	u2083	m135	BULK	Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
L384026	u2091	m135	SKULL	Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
L384025	u2083	m135	BULK	The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
L384504	u2084	m135	DULCEA	The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
L384503	u2092	m135	TOMMY	And how do we release the power?
L384384	u2084	m135	DULCEA	Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
L384383	u2092	m135	TOMMY	... A falcon?
L384382	u2084	m135	DULCEA	Look closer.
L384381	u2092	m135	TOMMY	It's... an eagle?
L384353	u2084	m135	DULCEA	By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
L384352	u2092	m135	TOMMY	And how do we do that?
L384662	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
L384661	u2088	m135	MORDANT	BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
L384660	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	GET OFF ME!
L384659	u2088	m135	MORDANT	Wait for me!
L384658	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	I'm outta here.
L384488	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	Did I say anything?
L384487	u2088	m135	MORDANT	Just shut your gap!
L384477	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	How about Major Moron?
L384476	u2088	m135	MORDANT	As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
L384432	u2088	m135	MORDANT	What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
L384431	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	Hey, boss!
L384262	u2088	m135	MORDANT	Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
L384261	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
L384549	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	GO IVAN!!
L384548	u2086	m135	IVAN	THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
L384528	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	"You forgot to say 'Simon says."""
L384527	u2086	m135	IVAN	What!
L384425	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	Quack like a'duck!
L384424	u2086	m135	IVAN	Simon says...
L384291	u2086	m135	IVAN	Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
L384290	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	But boss, what about their parents?
L384289	u2086	m135	IVAN	Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
L384288	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
L384286	u2085	m135	GOLDAR	You want me to place a few calls?
L384285	u2086	m135	IVAN	Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
L384480	u2086	m135	IVAN	Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
L384479	u2088	m135	MORDANT	What is THAT!
L384443	u2086	m135	IVAN	Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
L384442	u2088	m135	MORDANT	How'd you know?
L384441	u2086	m135	IVAN	Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
L384439	u2088	m135	MORDANT	Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
L384438	u2086	m135	IVAN	"What do you mean ""basically""?"
L384437	u2088	m135	MORDANT	Basically.
L384436	u2086	m135	IVAN	So they've been destroyed?
L384435	u2088	m135	MORDANT	That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
L384268	u2088	m135	MORDANT	You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
L384267	u2086	m135	IVAN	Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
L384735	u2089	m135	RITA	We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
L384734	u2093	m135	ZEDD	That was a CHEAP shot!
L384711	u2093	m135	ZEDD	GO POWER RANGERS!
L384710	u2089	m135	RITA	I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
L384271	u2089	m135	RITA	From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
L384270	u2093	m135	ZEDD	Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
L384253	u2093	m135	ZEDD	How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
L384252	u2089	m135	RITA	Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
L384109	u2089	m135	RITA	Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
L384108	u2093	m135	ZEDD	Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
L384636	u2092	m135	TOMMY	NINJA FALCON ZORD!
L384635	u2090	m135	ROCKY	NINJA APE ZORD!
L384591	u2092	m135	TOMMY	LET'S DO IT!?
L384590	u2090	m135	ROCKY	THREE SECONDS!!
L384576	u2092	m135	TOMMY	And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
L384575	u2090	m135	ROCKY	I am the mighty ape!
L384570	u2090	m135	ROCKY	Strength in numbers!!
L384569	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
L384452	u2090	m135	ROCKY	What's going on?!
L384451	u2092	m135	TOMMY	How the heck?!...
L384186	u2090	m135	ROCKY	Activating Power Scope!
L384185	u2092	m135	TOMMY	Anybody see them?
L406493	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
L406492	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
L406490	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
L406489	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
L406488	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
L406487	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
L406486	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
L406485	u2229	m144	CAULAINCOURT	But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
L406484	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
L406571	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
L406570	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
L406569	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
L406568	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
L406567	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	What do you think Napoleon will do?
L406566	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
L406565	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Proceed.
L406564	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
L406563	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
L406562	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
L406561	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
L406560	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
L406559	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
L406557	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
L406556	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Ah, yes -- proceed.
L406555	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
L406554	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
L406553	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
L406552	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
L406551	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
L406550	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
L406549	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
L406548	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
L406547	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
L406546	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
L406545	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
L406544	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Proceed.
L406543	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
L406542	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
L406541	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
L406540	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
L406539	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
L406538	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
L406537	u2236	m144	GENERAL KUTUSOV	I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
L406385	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
L406384	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What do you mean?
L406383	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
L406382	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	"Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. ""Berthier sees only what is in the open,"" Murat said.  ""But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest.""  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment."
L406381	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
L406380	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
L406373	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
L406372	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	Whatever suggested the idea to you?
L406371	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm glad you like it.
L406370	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	I think it's absolutely charming.
L406369	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah -- you approve?
L406368	u2224	m144	ALEXANDER	And, what a delightful idea!
L406367	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
L405993	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
L405992	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Our lives, the revolution, my career?
L405991	u2225	m144	BARRAS	You realize what is at stake?
L405990	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm not insulted.
L405989	u2225	m144	BARRAS	I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
L405988	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Fair enough.
L405987	u2225	m144	BARRAS	In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
L405986	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
L405985	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
L405984	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
L405983	u2225	m144	BARRAS	These are odds of 8 to 1.
L405982	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Properly arranged, yes.
L405981	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
L405980	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You could have them here by daybreak.
L405979	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
L405978	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Where are they?
L405977	u2225	m144	BARRAS	There are none here.
L405976	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Any cannon?
L405975	u2225	m144	BARRAS	The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
L405974	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Cavalry?
L405973	u2225	m144	BARRAS	About 5,000 troops.
L405972	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What forces do you have at your disposal?
L405971	u2225	m144	BARRAS	I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
L405970	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Are you serious?
L405969	u2225	m144	BARRAS	To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
L405968	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What do you have in mind?
L405967	u2225	m144	BARRAS	We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
L405966	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Things are quite serious, I should say.
L405965	u2225	m144	BARRAS	I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
L405964	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, thank you.
L405963	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
L405962	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
L405961	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
L405934	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	May I come to the map?
L405933	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Please...
L405932	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
L405931	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
L405930	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I did, sir.
L405929	u2225	m144	BARRAS	Yes -- who spoke up?
L406618	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
L406617	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
L406616	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And where is Joseph?
L406615	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I don't know, sire.
L406614	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
L406613	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
L406612	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But who made this treaty?
L406611	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
L406610	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
L406609	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
L406605	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
L406604	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
L406603	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	Unhappily, it is true, sire.
L406602	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
L406601	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
L406600	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And who is defending Paris?
L406599	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	It is on this road, sire, following me.
L406598	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And where is the army?
L406597	u2226	m144	BELLIARD	They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
L406596	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
L406706	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
L406705	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	No, sire... I was asleep.
L406704	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
L406703	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	Yes, sire?
L406702	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
L406701	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	Bertrand, sire.
L406700	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Who is there?
L406641	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
L406640	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
L406639	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
L406638	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	That is incredible.
L406637	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
L406636	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
L406635	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
L406634	u2227	m144	BERTRAND	It is a terrible shock.
L406633	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
L406173	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Let me see it.
L406172	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
L406171	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406170	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
L406169	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come back in an hour.
L406168	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	General Bonaparte?
L406107	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, shit, that's not right.
L406106	u2228	m144	BOURRIENNE	To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
L406105	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Read it back.
L406079	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You may go, Captain Charles.
L406078	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
L406077	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
L406076	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Thank you, sir.
L406075	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
L406074	u2230	m144	CHARLES	No, sir, none at all.
L406073	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
L406072	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir.
L406071	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Was the trip normal in every respect?
L406070	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir.
L406069	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
L406068	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir, I am.
L406067	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
L406066	u2230	m144	CHARLES	Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
L406065	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
L405954	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I see...
L405953	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
L405952	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
L405951	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah-hh, no.
L405950	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
L405949	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
L405948	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
L405947	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, they're living in Nice now.
L405946	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
L405945	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I haven't been there for three years.
L405944	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Have you been back recently?
L405943	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ajaccio.
L405942	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Bastia -- and you?
L405941	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh -- where do you come from?
L405940	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
L405939	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, I am.
L405938	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
L405937	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A glass of champagne, please.
L405936	u2231	m144	CORSICAN	Yes, sir?
L406587	u2247	m144	PICART	My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
L406586	u2232	m144	DIDIER	When you eat him, may I have some?
L406585	u2247	m144	PICART	His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
L406584	u2232	m144	DIDIER	Why are you carrying the dog?
L406583	u2247	m144	PICART	Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
L406582	u2232	m144	DIDIER	Hello there, Picart.
L406536	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
L406535	u2233	m144	DUROC	From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
L406534	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
L406533	u2233	m144	DUROC	We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
L406532	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Impossible, I don't believe it.
L406531	u2233	m144	DUROC	Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
L406530	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
L406529	u2233	m144	DUROC	It is the work of incendiaries.
L406528	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How did it spread so quickly?
L406527	u2233	m144	DUROC	At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
L406526	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Why didn't you wake me then?
L406525	u2233	m144	DUROC	The first reports came in at about ten.
L406524	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	When did it start?
L406523	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My God, what a fire!
L406522	u2233	m144	DUROC	Four o'clock.
L406521	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My God...!  What time is it?
L406428	u2233	m144	DUROC	May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
L406427	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
L406426	u2233	m144	DUROC	No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
L406425	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
L406424	u2233	m144	DUROC	Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
L406423	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	What is that?
L406422	u2233	m144	DUROC	The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
L406421	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	Oh?
L406420	u2233	m144	DUROC	I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
L406419	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
L406418	u2233	m144	DUROC	Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
L406417	u2249	m144	SCHWARZENBURG	Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
L406416	u2233	m144	DUROC	Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
L406023	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
L406022	u2234	m144	EUGENE	My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
L406021	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
L406020	u2234	m144	EUGENE	No, sir.
L406019	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Does your mother know you have come?
L406018	u2234	m144	EUGENE	He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
L406017	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And he sent you to me?
L406016	u2234	m144	EUGENE	I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
L406015	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
L406014	u2234	m144	EUGENE	This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
L406013	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That is correct.
L406012	u2234	m144	EUGENE	I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
L406011	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I have met her.  What is your business with me?
L406010	u2234	m144	EUGENE	Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
L406009	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
L406008	u2234	m144	EUGENE	Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
L406007	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
L406359	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
L406358	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	No -- not as a rule.
L406357	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
L406356	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	Thank you, Napoleon.
L406354	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'll have the fire built up.
L406353	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	Thank you.
L406352	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Would you like some brandy?
L406351	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
L406350	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
L406349	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
L406348	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I see.
L406347	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
L406346	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh...?
L406345	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I very much doubt that he will.
L406344	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Will Alexander be joining us soon?
L406343	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	Yes -- an excellent idea.
L406342	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Shall we move closer to the fire?
L406341	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
L406340	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
L406339	u2235	m144	FRANCIS	I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
L406338	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
L405901	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, yes... of course.
L405900	u2237	m144	GIRL	Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
L405899	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
L405898	u2237	m144	GIRL	Lisette La Croix.
L405897	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Only Lisette?
L405896	u2237	m144	GIRL	Lisette.
L405895	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What's your name?
L405894	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, I'm sorry about that.
L405893	u2237	m144	GIRL	Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
L405892	u2237	m144	GIRL	Do you have three francs, sir?
L405891	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
L405890	u2237	m144	GIRL	Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
L405889	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
L405888	u2237	m144	GIRL	Is it a nice warm room, sir?
L405887	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
L405886	u2237	m144	GIRL	Are you staying with a friend, sir?
L405885	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
L405884	u2237	m144	GIRL	One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
L405883	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
L405882	u2237	m144	GIRL	Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
L405881	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Then what brings you out on such a night?
L405880	u2237	m144	GIRL	Yes, I am, sir.
L405879	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
L405878	u2237	m144	GIRL	Yes, it must be.
L405877	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
L405876	u2237	m144	GIRL	The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
L405875	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Good evening, Mademoiselle.
L405874	u2237	m144	GIRL	Good evening, sir.
L406251	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
L406250	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Will you use the troops?
L406199	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
L406198	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
L406197	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
L406196	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	When is she supposed to return?
L406195	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, you shall see.
L406194	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
L406193	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Are you trying to insult me?
L406192	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
L406191	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
L406190	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
L406189	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
L406188	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	You must not act impetuously.
L406187	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
L406186	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
L406185	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I know of no better time.
L406184	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
L406183	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
L406092	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And you, Junot?
L406091	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
L406090	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
L406089	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
L406088	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Not even the slightest hint of something?
L406087	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	No... nothing at all.
L406084	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Junot?
L406083	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	No...
L406082	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
L406081	u2238	m144	JOSEPH	To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
L406080	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
L406470	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
L406469	u2243	m144	MONTESQUIOU	And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
L406468	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, that is good.
L406467	u2243	m144	MONTESQUIOU	I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
L406466	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
L406465	u2243	m144	MONTESQUIOU	I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
L406464	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
L406331	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
L406330	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
L406329	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
L406328	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
L406325	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	It's me.
L406324	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Who is it?
L406323	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
L406322	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
L406321	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	But you will not... be safe...
L406320	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.
L406319	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Separate bedrooms?
L406311	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Goodbye.
L406310	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Five minutes.
L406309	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes!!
L406308	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Five minutes.
L406307	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
L406306	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Will you be joining us, soon?
L406305	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
L406304	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	What are you doing in there?
L406303	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
L406302	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Where is Madame Trillaud?
L406301	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
L406300	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	I know what you're doing in there.
L406299	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Go away -- I'm busy.
L406298	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Open the door.  It's me.
L406297	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes -- what is it?
L406230	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	You are my old friend.
L406229	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	All right -- I promise.
L406228	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
L406227	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Promises mean nothing.
L406226	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Promise.
L406225	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I don't understand you.
L406224	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
L406223	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I will never forgive you.
L406222	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Promise me.
L406221	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I cannot promise you that.
L406220	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Promise me you will never leave me.
L406219	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
L406218	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	She must have been in love with you.
L406217	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
L406216	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were any of them married?
L406215	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	One had better legs.
L406214	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were any of them prettier than I am?
L406213	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.
L406212	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were they pretty?
L406211	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No.
L406210	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Were you in love with any of them?
L406209	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Of course.
L406208	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	But you have had mistresses while you were away.
L406207	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No.
L406206	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	And you, are you in love with any one else?
L406205	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Yes.
L406204	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Do you expect me to believe that?
L406203	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
L406202	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And now?
L406201	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	I thought I was.  I was confused.
L406200	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Were you in love with him?
L406045	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
L406044	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
L406043	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
L406040	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
L406039	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
L406038	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
L406035	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
L406034	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
L406033	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
L406032	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
L406031	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	May I offer you a drink?
L406030	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
L406029	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
L406028	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
L406027	u2239	m144	JOSEPHINE	Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
L406167	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
L406166	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
L406165	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
L406164	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes, of course.  What do you want?
L406163	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Can you give me a drink, please?
L406162	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
L406161	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How did you know it was Captain Charles?
L406160	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes.
L406159	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You mean you heard them making love?
L406158	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes.
L406157	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You could hear them?
L406155	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes?
L406154	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
L406153	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How do you know?
L406152	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I know.
L406151	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	How do you know?
L406150	u2240	m144	JUNOT	God help me -- yes.
L406149	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Do you know what you're saying?
L406148	u2240	m144	JUNOT	My God, what do you think?
L406147	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What was there to tell?
L406146	u2240	m144	JUNOT	About Hippolyte Charles.
L406145	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You couldn't face telling me what?
L406144	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I couldn't face telling you.
L406143	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You wrote it.
L406142	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes, I wrote it.
L406141	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What?
L406140	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I wrote it.
L406139	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes.
L406138	u2240	m144	JUNOT	You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
L406137	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
L406136	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
L406135	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What the hell is the matter with you?
L406134	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
L406133	u2240	m144	JUNOT	There are some things... better left unsaid.
L406132	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
L406131	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
L406130	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
L406129	u2240	m144	JUNOT	That's all I can say.
L406128	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
L406127	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Nothing.  That's all I can say.
L406126	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What are you talking about?
L406125	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
L406124	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Why not?
L406123	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
L406122	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Certainly.
L406121	u2240	m144	JUNOT	Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
L406120	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
L406119	u2240	m144	JUNOT	He's downstairs -- somewhere.
L406118	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
L406117	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
L406116	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
L406115	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
L406114	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Why did you give it to him?
L406113	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
L406112	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
L406111	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
L406110	u2240	m144	JUNOT	There's probably some explanation.
L406109	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
L406104	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
L406103	u2240	m144	JUNOT	I believe you sent for me.
L406086	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
L406085	u2240	m144	JUNOT	No, one cannot simply ignore it.
L406481	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
L406480	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
L406479	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
L406478	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
L406477	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
L406476	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
L406475	u2248	m144	RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN	My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
L406474	u2241	m144	MAJOR FIDON	Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
L406460	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
L406459	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	No.
L406458	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
L406457	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
L406456	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
L406455	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
L406454	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
L406453	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
L406452	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
L406451	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
L406450	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
L406449	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
L406448	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
L406447	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
L406446	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
L406445	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Of course, my dear.
L406444	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
L406443	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, I do -- very much.
L406442	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Do you like music?
L406440	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
L406439	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
L406437	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
L406436	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	And, where did you see my portrait?
L406434	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
L406433	u2242	m144	MARIE-LOUISE	Oh, then you are...
L406432	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
L406408	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
L406407	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
L406406	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That is a matter of opinion.
L406405	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
L406404	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
L406403	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	And where do you place Alexander?
L406402	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
L406401	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	What I am talking about is moderation.
L406400	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
L406399	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
L406398	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	We have a treaty with Austria.
L406397	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
L406396	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
L406395	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
L406394	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	That is correct.
L406393	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	"Now, the section headed ""Secret Clauses of the Treaty"" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade."
L406392	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Yes, he has.
L406391	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Has Alexander agreed to this?
L406390	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I did not ask her to go to war against me.
L406389	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Those are extremely harsh terms.
L406388	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Does she deserve anything better?
L406387	u2250	m144	TALLEYRAND	Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
L405915	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
L405914	u2251	m144	VARLAC	I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
L405912	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
L405911	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
L405910	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
L405909	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
L405908	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
L405907	u2251	m144	VARLAC	A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
L405905	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
L405904	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
L405903	u2251	m144	VARLAC	Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
L406262	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Send him in.
L406261	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
L406260	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406255	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Let me have it.
L406254	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	A message from Citizen Fouche.
L406253	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406247	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Send him in.
L406246	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Major Lavallette to see you, General.
L406245	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Come in.
L406005	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Show him in.
L406004	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Yes, sir.
L406003	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Is he alone?
L406002	u2246	m144	ORDERLY	Eugene de Beauharnais.
L406001	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	What did you say his name was?
L406589	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
L406588	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
L406506	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
L406505	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
L406362	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
L406361	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
L406281	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
L406280	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	"On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  ""I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."""
L406062	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
L406061	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
L405873	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
L405872	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
L405871	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
L405870	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	His moods at this time were complex and varied.
L405854	u2244	m144	NAPOLEON	My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
L405853	u2245	m144	NARRATOR	Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
L41091	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Get on! Anastasia, get on!
L41090	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	Hurry, Grandmama!
L41067	u3674	m242	TATIANA	When you're older . . .
L41066	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	"Together in Paris! Oh, when can we be ""together in Paris?!"
L41065	u3674	m242	TATIANA	It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
L41064	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
L41063	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I know, but I had to because . . .
L41062	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
L41061	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	How to read.
L41060	u3674	m242	TATIANA	What were you showing her?
L41059	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I was showing Sonya something . . .
L41058	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Why were you so late tonight
L41132	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then come find me.
L41131	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
L41130	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
L41129	u3670	m242	GREGOR	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
L41128	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have to go now, before it gets light.
L41123	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm not sure but look. . .
L41122	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Where is your home, Anya?
L41117	u3667	m242	ANYA	No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
L41116	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Are you running away?
L41592	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
L41591	u3667	m242	ANYA	Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
L41590	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
L41586	u3667	m242	ANYA	Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
L41585	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41584	u3667	m242	ANYA	Poor Meetoo!
L41583	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41582	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
L41397	u3667	m242	ANYA	Not you. Him.
L41396	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I shant!
L41395	u3667	m242	ANYA	You'll laugh.
L41394	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Come out! I can do alterations.
L41393	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I look ridiculous!
L41383	u3667	m242	ANYA	You must have.
L41382	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Did I tell you that?
L41373	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
L41372	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We're just going to refresh your memory...
L41368	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
L41367	u3667	m242	ANYA	Who's Sophie?
L41366	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
L41356	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm fine.
L41355	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Is everyone all right?
L41348	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
L41347	u3667	m242	ANYA	Noooo....
L41242	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
L41241	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
L41201	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Good day!
L41200	u3667	m242	ANYA	Well, I don't have any money . . .
L41199	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
L41198	u3667	m242	ANYA	I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
L41197	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Who did you hear it from?
L41633	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'll never let go!
L41632	u3667	m242	ANYA	Don't let me go!
L41621	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya... where are we?
L41620	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri?
L41559	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
L41497	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
L41496	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No! Well, yes, but
L41495	u3667	m242	ANYA	Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
L41494	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya, wait!
L41486	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Don't be
L41485	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm so scared...
L41447	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
L41446	u3667	m242	ANYA	Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
L41445	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Nervous?
L41434	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's okay. Didn't hurt..
L41433	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh! I'm sorry...
L41412	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
L41411	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry.
L41410	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
L41409	u3667	m242	ANYA	I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
L41408	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
L41407	u3667	m242	ANYA	Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
L41406	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Sad?
L41405	u3667	m242	ANYA	It's so beautiful ... and sad.
L41400	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's not you - it's the dress!
L41399	u3667	m242	ANYA	You said you wouldn't laugh!
L41389	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
L41388	u3667	m242	ANYA	What a beautiful ship!
L41386	u3667	m242	ANYA	The dessert fork!
L41385	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's the best fork of all
L41384	u3667	m242	ANYA	...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
L41381	u3667	m242	ANYA	Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
L41380	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Every Russian family has one..
L41371	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You are the Princess.
L41370	u3667	m242	ANYA	You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
L41354	u3667	m242	ANYA	You shouldn't have pushed us!
L41353	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You must enjoy causing me pain!
L41351	u3667	m242	ANYA	No!
L41350	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on!
L41346	u3667	m242	ANYA	HUH?!
L41345	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Now just get off the train.
L41344	u3667	m242	ANYA	Forged papers! Now, what?!
L41342	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Trying... to... breathe...
L41341	u3667	m242	ANYA	Just what do you think you're doing?!
L41340	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why?
L41339	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on up!
L41334	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
L41333	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm going to stretch my legs
L41318	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I was all out of dynamite!
L41317	u3667	m242	ANYA	By pulling my hair?!
L41316	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
L41315	u3667	m242	ANYA	Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
L41314	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
L41248	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
L41247	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You never thought of the possibility?
L41245	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
L41244	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have my reasons.
L41243	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Why do you want to go to Paris?
L41239	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
L41238	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
L41237	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
L41236	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
L41235	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What happened to your parents?
L41234	u3669	m242	DMITRI	People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
L41222	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Who are you?!
L41221	u3667	m242	ANYA	AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
L41195	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
L41194	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
L41193	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Ouch!  That really hurt!
L41605	u3674	m242	TATIANA	And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
L41604	u3667	m242	ANYA	I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
L41602	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Yes, you do. You do.
L41601	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
L41600	u3674	m242	TATIANA	This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
L41599	u3667	m242	ANYA	And this is my future. This is who I am!
L41598	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
L41597	u3667	m242	ANYA	I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
L41596	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Is it? Is this what you want?
L41595	u3667	m242	ANYA	If I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
L41594	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
L41593	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why does everyone have to act that way?
L41589	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
L41588	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri didn't want the money?
L41579	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
L41578	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
L41577	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't you, child?
L41533	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
L41532	u3667	m242	ANYA	No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
L41531	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
L41525	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
L41524	u3667	m242	ANYA	... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
L41519	u3667	m242	ANYA	THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
L41518	u3674	m242	TATIANA	PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
L41514	u3667	m242	ANYA	I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
L41513	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Do you remember this?
L41512	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
L41511	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Who are you, child?
L41474	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Shut up!
L41473	u3668	m242	BARTOK	PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
L41431	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
L41430	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
L41427	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
L41426	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
L41417	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
L41416	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
L41415	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok... a question.
L41414	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting a chest cold..
L41361	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
L41360	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
L41288	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
L41287	u3668	m242	BARTOK	You'd lose your security deposit?
L41286	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
L41281	u3668	m242	BARTOK	"My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said ""Curses were made to be broken"". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound..."
L41280	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I cursed then all!
L41279	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
L41275	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	How do you know?
L41274	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Trust me, it's her!
L41272	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
L41271	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
L41270	u3668	m242	BARTOK	So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
L41268	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
L41267	u3668	m242	BARTOK	No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
L41266	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
L41264	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
L41263	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
L41262	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What?
L41565	u3669	m242	DMITRI	She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
L41564	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	So where will you go?
L41563	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Watch me.
L41562	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
L41470	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
L41469	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you mean?
L41468	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
L41466	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you feeling all right?
L41464	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
L41439	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It worked in Odessa...
L41438	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"The ""Odessa Dunk""?"
L41437	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"If I used the word ""bleak"" I would be optimistic."
L41436	u3669	m242	DMITRI	How is our current financial status?
L41377	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah! Let us begin!
L41376	u3669	m242	DMITRI	See? The Princess is under there ...
L41331	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Pray he's color-blind...
L41330	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	What do we do now?
L41325	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
L41324	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
L41323	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
L41322	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're a princess...
L41309	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness""."
L41308	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Wake up, your highness - we should start getting used to saying it.
L41307	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
L41305	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
L41304	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hurry up with those papers.
L41231	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ew. . .  the honest type.
L41230	u3669	m242	DMITRI	"She doesn't want to do anything ""dishonest"". . ."
L41227	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Look!
L41226	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	He's her?
L41225	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's her.
L41213	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
L41212	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What was that?
L41191	u3669	m242	DMITRI	We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
L41190	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
L41624	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Run, Anya -  go...
L41623	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I'll show you!
L41572	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
L41571	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
L41570	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
L41569	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you want?!
L41568	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
L41567	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Rasputin!
L41566	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
L41558	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
L41557	u3669	m242	DMITRI	And tell me that she's happy.
L41556	u3674	m242	TATIANA	She does.
L41555	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Promise me she'll have her home.
L41554	u3674	m242	TATIANA	That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
L41553	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I should go
L41552	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You are the boy ...
L41549	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
L41548	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
L41547	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No. Empress, you --
L41546	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
L41507	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
L41506	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
L41502	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
L41501	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
L41491	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Remove him at once.
L41490	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Please, if you'd just listen...
L41489	u3674	m242	TATIANA	How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
L41488	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
L41074	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
L41073	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I did no such thing!
L41072	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	You gave the orders!
L41071	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I had nothing to do with it!
L41070	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
L41069	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
L41462	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
L41461	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Perhaps you could convince her?
L41460	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
L41459	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
L41458	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
L41457	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
L41449	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
L41448	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
L45646	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
L45645	u3725	m245	Z	This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
L45644	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Break's over.
L45643	u3725	m245	Z	Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
L45642	u3716	m245	AZTECA	No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
L45641	u3725	m245	Z	The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
L45640	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
L45639	u3725	m245	Z	Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
L45972	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Right...because every ant's important!
L45971	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Someone who follows his heart!
L45968	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No -- an <u>individual</u>!
L45967	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Invisible!
L45966	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
L45963	u3716	m245	AZTECA	That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
L45962	u3724	m245	WEAVER	You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
L45875	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
L45874	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
L45862	u3716	m245	AZTECA	I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
L45861	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
L45860	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Are you asking me out to dinner?
L45859	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
L45858	u3716	m245	AZTECA	I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
L45852	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
L45851	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
L45850	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Tell me about it.
L45849	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I'm new...I was born yesterday.
L45848	u3716	m245	AZTECA	Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
L46149	u3717	m245	BALA	Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
L46148	u3720	m245	FORMICA	You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
L46147	u3717	m245	BALA	Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
L46146	u3720	m245	FORMICA	It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
L46145	u3717	m245	BALA	He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
L45677	u3717	m245	BALA	Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
L45676	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well...  I declared war!
L45675	u3717	m245	BALA	So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
L45672	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
L45671	u3717	m245	BALA	General -- we have to talk sometime!
L46263	u3717	m245	BALA	A <u>few</u>?
L46262	u3725	m245	Z	I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
L46181	u3725	m245	Z	I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
L46180	u3717	m245	BALA	Z!  what are you doing?
L46179	u3717	m245	BALA	Oh no...
L46178	u3725	m245	Z	Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
L46176	u3717	m245	BALA	There's something going on, Z --
L46175	u3725	m245	Z	Why do they have you tied up here?
L46115	u3725	m245	Z	Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
L46114	u3717	m245	BALA	You held onto this all that time?
L46113	u3725	m245	Z	Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
L46112	u3725	m245	Z	"Well, ""trouble"" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night."
L46111	u3717	m245	BALA	Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
L46110	u3725	m245	Z	So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
L46094	u3725	m245	Z	"Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. ""Insectopia""."
L46093	u3717	m245	BALA	Come on, Z.
L46079	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
L46078	u3725	m245	Z	Yes?
L46077	u3717	m245	BALA	Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
L46043	u3725	m245	Z	Let's dig in!
L46042	u3717	m245	BALA	You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
L46041	u3725	m245	Z	We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
L46039	u3717	m245	BALA	What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
L46038	u3725	m245	Z	Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
L46037	u3717	m245	BALA	Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
L46004	u3717	m245	BALA	Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
L46003	u3725	m245	Z	So what makes you so special?
L46002	u3717	m245	BALA	Well...no, but --
L46001	u3725	m245	Z	And only you can become a Queen?
L46000	u3717	m245	BALA	Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
L45999	u3725	m245	Z	Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
L45998	u3717	m245	BALA	General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
L45997	u3725	m245	Z	Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
L45994	u3717	m245	BALA	Stop fooling around in there.
L45993	u3725	m245	Z	Hlllllllp!
L45992	u3717	m245	BALA	Out here I'm just what?
L45991	u3725	m245	Z	"Listen, ""Princess"", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --"
L45990	u3717	m245	BALA	Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
L45989	u3725	m245	Z	This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
L45986	u3717	m245	BALA	Wait, I hear something!
L45985	u3725	m245	Z	Want a list?
L45984	u3717	m245	BALA	Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
L45982	u3725	m245	Z	Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
L45981	u3717	m245	BALA	We're going to die!
L45979	u3725	m245	Z	<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
L45978	u3717	m245	BALA	My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
L45977	u3725	m245	Z	Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
L45976	u3717	m245	BALA	Water...water...
L45958	u3717	m245	BALA	That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
L45957	u3725	m245	Z	I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
L45956	u3717	m245	BALA	Worker!  Come back here now!
L45955	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
L45954	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
L45953	u3725	m245	Z	Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
L45952	u3717	m245	BALA	Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
L45951	u3717	m245	BALA	I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
L45950	u3725	m245	Z	Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
L45949	u3717	m245	BALA	I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
L45948	u3725	m245	Z	Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
L45947	u3717	m245	BALA	Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
L45946	u3725	m245	Z	Well I guess that makes us even.
L45945	u3717	m245	BALA	I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
L45944	u3725	m245	Z	Look around, sweetheart.
L45943	u3717	m245	BALA	"No!  There's no such thing as ""just two ants.""  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!"
L45942	u3725	m245	Z	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
L45941	u3717	m245	BALA	Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
L45940	u3725	m245	Z	Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
L45939	u3717	m245	BALA	How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
L45938	u3725	m245	Z	Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
L45937	u3717	m245	BALA	I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
L45936	u3717	m245	BALA	Climb up that tree and get a better view!
L45935	u3725	m245	Z	Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
L45934	u3725	m245	Z	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
L45933	u3717	m245	BALA	I order you to find out where we are!
L45932	u3725	m245	Z	How should <u>I know</u>?
L45931	u3717	m245	BALA	What <u>was</u> that thing?
L45918	u3717	m245	BALA	SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
L45917	u3725	m245	Z	-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
L45916	u3717	m245	BALA	Quiet -- sshhh!!
L45915	u3725	m245	Z	That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
L45914	u3717	m245	BALA	I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
L45913	u3725	m245	Z	Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
L45912	u3717	m245	BALA	OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
L45911	u3725	m245	Z	No...as a matter of fact...
L45910	u3717	m245	BALA	He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
L45908	u3717	m245	BALA	No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
L45907	u3725	m245	Z	Divinely?
L45906	u3717	m245	BALA	You dance...
L45905	u3725	m245	Z	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
L45904	u3717	m245	BALA	No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
L45898	u3725	m245	Z	Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
L45897	u3717	m245	BALA	Yes.
L45896	u3725	m245	Z	Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
L45895	u3717	m245	BALA	I'm Princess Bala.
L45894	u3725	m245	Z	And you are...?
L45893	u3725	m245	Z	Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
L45892	u3717	m245	BALA	You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
L45761	u3717	m245	BALA	Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
L45760	u3725	m245	Z	Wait!  When can I see you again?
L45759	u3717	m245	BALA	Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
L45750	u3717	m245	BALA	Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
L45749	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
L45748	u3717	m245	BALA	You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
L45746	u3717	m245	BALA	Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
L45745	u3725	m245	Z	You -- you think I'm right?
L45744	u3717	m245	BALA	You're right!
L45743	u3725	m245	Z	Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
L45742	u3717	m245	BALA	Really?
L45741	u3725	m245	Z	Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
L45740	u3717	m245	BALA	Are you sure this is a real dance?
L45737	u3717	m245	BALA	<u>What</u>?
L45736	u3725	m245	Z	The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
L45735	u3717	m245	BALA	I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
L45734	u3725	m245	Z	So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
L45732	u3717	m245	BALA	Wanna dance?
L45731	u3725	m245	Z	What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
L45721	u3717	m245	BALA	Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
L45720	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course not --
L45719	u3717	m245	BALA	And do Princesses do improper things?
L45718	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course --
L45717	u3717	m245	BALA	I'm the Princess, aren't I?
L45716	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
L45693	u3717	m245	BALA	The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
L45692	u3721	m245	HANDMAIDEN #2	There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
L45691	u3717	m245	BALA	The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
L46192	u3717	m245	BALA	Mom!
L46191	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Bala!
L45794	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
L45793	u3717	m245	BALA	Who is that idiot?
L45684	u3717	m245	BALA	Yes...he's wonderful...
L45683	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
L45682	u3717	m245	BALA	You did?
L45681	u3723	m245	QUEEN	I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
L45667	u3717	m245	BALA	It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
L45666	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
L45847	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
L45846	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
L45845	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	I wonder...what...was it all...for...
L45844	u3725	m245	Z	Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
L45843	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
L45842	u3725	m245	Z	No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
L45841	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
L45840	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus!
L45839	u3725	m245	Z	Barbatus?
L45838	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Z!  Over here!
L45826	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't get all sappy about it!
L45825	u3725	m245	Z	BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
L45819	u3725	m245	Z	Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
L45818	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
L45814	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Superior numbers, kid!
L45813	u3725	m245	Z	So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
L45811	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
L45810	u3725	m245	Z	Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
L45805	u3725	m245	Z	Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
L45804	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	No -- we're going to attack the termites!
L45803	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
L45802	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
L45799	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
L45798	u3725	m245	Z	I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
L45797	u3718	m245	BARBATUS	You new, kid?
L46250	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
L46249	u3720	m245	FORMICA	What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
L46035	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Ant Team Six...
L46034	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
L46033	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
L46032	u3720	m245	FORMICA	"What do we have on this ""Insectopia""?"
L46014	u3720	m245	FORMICA	No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
L46013	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
L46012	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
L46008	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
L46007	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
L45679	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Duty calls!
L45678	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
L45674	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Outstanding.  Princess...?
L45673	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
L45664	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
L45663	u3719	m245	CARPENTER	Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
L46027	u3724	m245	WEAVER	No, sir!
L46026	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Not that one.  Or that one.
L46025	u3724	m245	WEAVER	That's correct, sir!
L46024	u3720	m245	FORMICA	We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
L46023	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Okay, son.
L46022	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I...I have no idea, sir.
L46021	u3720	m245	FORMICA	So tell me.  Where's Z?
L46020	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Thank you, sir.
L46019	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Good.  You're a good soldier.
L46018	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Oh, no, sir!
L46017	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
L46016	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
L46015	u3720	m245	FORMICA	So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
L45922	u3725	m245	Z	Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
L45921	u3720	m245	FORMICA	ARREST HIM!
L45920	u3725	m245	Z	Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
L45919	u3720	m245	FORMICA	What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
L45903	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, of course --
L45902	u3720	m245	FORMICA	May I cut in?
L45889	u3725	m245	Z	Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
L45888	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
L45887	u3725	m245	Z	"Well I, I don't think ""living it up"" is the right term -- how about ""working themselves to death""?"
L45886	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
L45885	u3725	m245	Z	...Not enough food?
L45884	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
L45883	u3725	m245	Z	Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
L45882	u3720	m245	FORMICA	In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
L45881	u3725	m245	Z	So...you two are in love?
L45880	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Affirmative.
L45879	u3725	m245	Z	Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
L45878	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
L45877	u3725	m245	Z	Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
L45876	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
L45873	u3725	m245	Z	ONE TO NOTHING!
L45872	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
L45871	u3725	m245	Z	Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
L45870	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
L45869	u3725	m245	Z	No -- you -- you don't understand!
L45788	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
L45787	u3725	m245	Z	Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
L45786	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
L45785	u3725	m245	Z	Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
L46188	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Alright, let's move out!
L46187	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
L46186	u3720	m245	FORMICA	'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
L46185	u3723	m245	QUEEN	But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
L46184	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
L45901	u3720	m245	FORMICA	They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
L45900	u3723	m245	QUEEN	All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
L45670	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
L45669	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
L45668	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
L45661	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
L45660	u3720	m245	FORMICA	I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
L45659	u3723	m245	QUEEN	No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
L45658	u3720	m245	FORMICA	Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
L45657	u3723	m245	QUEEN	Yes, what else?
L45656	u3720	m245	FORMICA	We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
L45655	u3723	m245	QUEEN	General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
L45635	u3725	m245	Z	But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
L45634	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	"You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, ""Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."""
L45633	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
L45632	u3725	m245	Z	...Ants...
L45631	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	What do you see out there?
L45630	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	I'm glad you asked me that question!
L45629	u3725	m245	Z	Why are we so successful?
L45628	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Ask me why we're so successful.
L45626	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	"YES!!!  You know, people ask me, ""Doctor, why are you always happy?"" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?"
L45625	u3725	m245	Z	...I should?
L45624	u3722	m245	MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
L45623	u3725	m245	Z	I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
L46222	u3724	m245	WEAVER	You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
L46221	u3725	m245	Z	Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
L45777	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
L45776	u3725	m245	Z	What do I do?
L45775	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah, I know.
L45774	u3725	m245	Z	You're a real buddy.
L45773	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Wear this.
L45772	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
L45771	u3725	m245	Z	You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
L45770	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
L45769	u3725	m245	Z	Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
L45768	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I can't think of any.
L45767	u3725	m245	Z	You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
L45766	u3725	m245	Z	What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
L45765	u3724	m245	WEAVER	It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
L45764	u3725	m245	Z	Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
L45763	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
L45726	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
L45725	u3725	m245	Z	I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
L45724	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Time to cut a rug, Z!
L45715	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
L45714	u3725	m245	Z	Hey, did you hear what he said?!
L45709	u3725	m245	Z	Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
L45708	u3724	m245	WEAVER	And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
L45707	u3725	m245	Z	Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
L45706	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
L45705	u3725	m245	Z	I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
L45704	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
L45703	u3725	m245	Z	Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
L45702	u3724	m245	WEAVER	Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
L45701	u3725	m245	Z	Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
L45700	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
L45699	u3725	m245	Z	Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
L45696	u3724	m245	WEAVER	I'll be back.
L45695	u3725	m245	Z	We declared war again?  Are you scared?
L61018	u3824	m253	BIFF	Where's your old man?
L61017	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you want, Biff?
L61016	u3824	m253	BIFF	Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
L61015	u3829	m253	MARTY	The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
L61014	u3824	m253	BIFF	Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
L61013	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you want, Biff?
L61012	u3824	m253	BIFF	Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
L61261	u3825	m253	CLERK	No....
L61260	u3829	m253	MARTY	And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
L61259	u3825	m253	CLERK	Uh, yes, sir...
L61258	u3829	m253	MARTY	This is 1952....?
L61257	u3825	m253	CLERK	I beg your pardon?
L61256	u3829	m253	MARTY	I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
L61255	u3825	m253	CLERK	Yes, sir!
L61254	u3829	m253	MARTY	This... is the number one single?
L60936	u3826	m253	DICK	I don't know. National Cash Register?
L60935	u3829	m253	MARTY	What's N.R.C.?
L60934	u3826	m253	DICK	Third time they've been out there this week.
L60933	u3829	m253	MARTY	Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
L60932	u3826	m253	DICK	Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
L60931	u3829	m253	MARTY	Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
L60930	u3826	m253	DICK	Marty. What's for breakfast?
L60929	u3829	m253	MARTY	Morning Dick.
L61486	u3829	m253	MARTY	You do?
L61485	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I think I know exactly what you mean.
L61483	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
L61482	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
L61478	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
L61477	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
L61476	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
L61475	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
L61429	u3829	m253	MARTY	Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
L61428	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Hi, Marty!
L61370	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
L61369	u3829	m253	MARTY	He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
L61368	u3829	m253	MARTY	But he does! Don't you see?
L61367	u3827	m253	EILEEN	But he didn't ask me.
L61366	u3829	m253	MARTY	George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
L61314	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah. Maybe so.
L61313	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
L61312	u3829	m253	MARTY	What time does school start around here?
L61311	u3829	m253	MARTY	School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
L61310	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Then you'll be going to school here....?
L61307	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
L61306	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
L61305	u3829	m253	MARTY	How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
L61304	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You remember me...?
L61302	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, hi....
L61301	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Hi, Marty.
L61189	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Have we ever met before?
L61188	u3829	m253	MARTY	Huh?
L61185	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Poly-what?
L61184	u3829	m253	MARTY	It's polyester.
L61182	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, thanks...
L61181	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Here's your jacket!
L61167	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Seventeen.
L61166	u3829	m253	MARTY	How old are you?
L61009	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
L61008	u3829	m253	MARTY	Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
L61007	u3827	m253	EILEEN	You mean you're going to stay up all night?
L60991	u3827	m253	EILEEN	That's good.
L60990	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh yeah.
L60989	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Learn anything?
L60988	u3829	m253	MARTY	Fine.
L60987	u3827	m253	EILEEN	How was school today?
L60977	u3829	m253	MARTY	I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
L60976	u3827	m253	EILEEN	I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
L61402	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
L61401	u3827	m253	EILEEN	How are you?
L61400	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Uh, hi, Eileen.
L61362	u3828	m253	GEORGE	No!
L61361	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
L60999	u3827	m253	EILEEN	George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
L60998	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Eileen, Chinese food again?
L60997	u3827	m253	EILEEN	By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
L60986	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Coming, Eileen...
L60985	u3827	m253	EILEEN	Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
L61456	u3829	m253	MARTY	No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
L61455	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Maybe if I used my left....
L61452	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
L61451	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
L61450	u3829	m253	MARTY	Your line, George!
L61449	u3829	m253	MARTY	George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
L61448	u3828	m253	GEORGE	You mean, you're gonna --
L61446	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Why is she gonna get angry with you?
L61445	u3829	m253	MARTY	Why what?
L61444	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Why?
L61443	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
L61442	u3828	m253	GEORGE	In the parking lot, with her.
L61441	u3829	m253	MARTY	And where am I gonna be?
L61440	u3828	m253	GEORGE	I'm going to be at the dance.
L61439	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
L61438	u3828	m253	GEORGE	But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
L61437	u3829	m253	MARTY	How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
L61436	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
L61435	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
L61434	u3828	m253	GEORGE	I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
L61395	u3829	m253	MARTY	Bic... It's a Bic pen.
L61394	u3828	m253	GEORGE	'Bike fine point?'
L61393	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Lemme see that.
L61392	u3829	m253	MARTY	It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
L61391	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
L61390	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
L61389	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Huh?
L61388	u3829	m253	MARTY	Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
L61387	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
L61386	u3829	m253	MARTY	Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
L61385	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What do I say?
L61381	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay, then!
L61380	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Well... yeah...
L61379	u3829	m253	MARTY	George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
L61360	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Not now....
L61359	u3829	m253	MARTY	You've gotta ask her to the dance!
L61006	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
L61005	u3828	m253	GEORGE	The sunrise? What for?
L61002	u3829	m253	MARTY	Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
L61001	u3828	m253	GEORGE	No, Chinese food is fine.
L60996	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Good.
L60995	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh yeah.
L60994	u3828	m253	GEORGE	Learn anything?
L60993	u3829	m253	MARTY	Fine..
L60981	u3829	m253	MARTY	The drill!  The power drill I bought you for Christmas. I was using it last night.
L60980	u3828	m253	GEORGE	What drill?
L60979	u3829	m253	MARTY	Dad, you seen the drill?
L61343	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Run out of gas?
L61342	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
L61341	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
L61340	u3829	m253	MARTY	Who, me?
L61320	u3829	m253	MARTY	Marty. Marty Lewis.
L61319	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You have a name?
L61318	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
L61317	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
L60953	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
L60952	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
L60951	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah, explode it up your ass!
L60950	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
L60949	u3829	m253	MARTY	You know damn well that's not what I meant.
L60948	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
L60947	u3829	m253	MARTY	Not a holocaust --
L60946	u3830	m253	MR. ARKY	You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
L61153	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Nineteen fifty --
L61152	u3829	m253	MARTY	What year?
L61151	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	March 11th.
L61150	u3829	m253	MARTY	Operator, what's today's date?
L61149	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	I'm sorry, there's no answer.
L61148	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Five cents, please.
L61147	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
L61146	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
L61145	u3829	m253	MARTY	What?
L61144	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Sir, it only costs a nickel.
L61143	u3829	m253	MARTY	Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
L61142	u3832	m253	OPERATOR	Operator...
L61106	u3829	m253	MARTY	Pro! Release the rope!
L61105	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	What?!
L61053	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah,  Right.
L61052	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
L61047	u3829	m253	MARTY	Home, school, here... 
L61046	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
L61043	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
L61042	u3829	m253	MARTY	What, am I radioactive or something?
L61039	u3829	m253	MARTY	What's this all about?
L61038	u3831	m253	N.R.C. AGENT REESE	Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
L61657	u3829	m253	MARTY	It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
L61656	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Pretty, isn't it?
L61654	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The Orpheum.
L61653	u3829	m253	MARTY	What theater was I at?
L61652	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
L61651	u3829	m253	MARTY	Obviously!  
L61650	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
L61649	u3829	m253	MARTY	But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
L61648	u3829	m253	MARTY	87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
L61647	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
L61644	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A car.
L61643	u3829	m253	MARTY	What do you call this? 
L61642	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
L61639	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
L61638	u3829	m253	MARTY	What year is this?
L61571	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
L61570	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
L61566	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
L61565	u3829	m253	MARTY	Thanks for everything, Pro.
L61561	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
L61560	u3829	m253	MARTY	It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
L61542	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Curious...  Very curious.
L61541	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
L61540	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You didn't?
L61472	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
L61471	u3829	m253	MARTY	Perfect...
L61470	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	There's no way of knowing.
L61469	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
L61468	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
L61467	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's just what I needed to hear.
L61466	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
L61465	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
L61464	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
L61463	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
L61462	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
L61461	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's all taken care of.
L61425	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jesus!
L61424	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
L61423	u3829	m253	MARTY	Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
L61422	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
L61421	u3829	m253	MARTY	But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
L61420	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	My guess is that she turned him down.
L61419	u3829	m253	MARTY	But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
L61418	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
L61414	u3829	m253	MARTY	Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
L61413	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
L61412	u3829	m253	MARTY	I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
L61411	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Where did you get this?
L61376	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
L61375	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
L61372	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You did what?!?
L61371	u3829	m253	MARTY	I know.
L61298	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Curious... Very curious....
L61297	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, it was there.
L61296	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I don't recall ever seeing it before.
L61295	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
L61294	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Say, where did this guitar come from?
L61291	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
L61290	u3829	m253	MARTY	You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
L61289	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
L61288	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, be serious, would you?
L61287	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	An atomic bomb.
L61250	u3829	m253	MARTY	Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
L61249	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
L61247	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
L61246	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
L61245	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
L61244	u3829	m253	MARTY	What if you lost your keys?
L61243	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
L61242	u3829	m253	MARTY	You were ringing the doorbell!
L61241	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You answered the door!
L61232	u3829	m253	MARTY	That's just great!
L61231	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
L61222	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	We don't....
L61221	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
L61219	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
L61218	u3829	m253	MARTY	How did you know?
L61215	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
L61214	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
L61213	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
L61212	u3829	m253	MARTY	The power converter...
L61211	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
L61205	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
L61204	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Pardon me?
L61202	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
L61201	u3829	m253	MARTY	You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
L61200	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
L61196	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
L61195	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A mall?
L61194	u3829	m253	MARTY	Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
L61193	u3829	m253	MARTY	Oh, yeah.
L61192	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
L61191	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
L61175	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
L61174	u3829	m253	MARTY	Marty.
L61173	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
L61171	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Ssshhhhh!
L61170	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
L61169	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	You know me?
L61168	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor? Professor Brown?
L61092	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure, he agreed quickly.
L61091	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
L61090	u3829	m253	MARTY	All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
L61089	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
L61088	u3829	m253	MARTY	So what? We'd be rich!
L61087	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Marty, that would alter history.
L61085	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
L61084	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A gold mine?
L61081	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
L61080	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
L61079	u3829	m253	MARTY	Is Shemp all right?
L61078	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
L61073	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Why?
L61072	u3829	m253	MARTY	The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
L61068	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Precisely! 
L61067	u3829	m253	MARTY	A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
L61064	u3829	m253	MARTY	Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
L61063	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
L61062	u3829	m253	MARTY	The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
L61061	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
L61060	u3829	m253	MARTY	Then where the hell is he?
L61059	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
L61057	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
L61056	u3829	m253	MARTY	But Professor --
L60928	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	...To be traveled through
L60927	u3829	m253	MARTY	Catch you later! 
L60925	u3829	m253	MARTY	Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
L60924	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Oh, right, right... 
L60923	u3829	m253	MARTY	Pro, the sun's out!
L60922	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	AM or PM?
L60921	u3829	m253	MARTY	Eight thirty.
L60920	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
L60919	u3829	m253	MARTY	Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
L60918	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
L60915	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
L60914	u3829	m253	MARTY	That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
L60913	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
L60911	u3833	m253	PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN	Shhhhhhhh!
L60910	u3829	m253	MARTY	Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
L61127	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
L61126	u3829	m253	MARTY	What happened to Dick Wilson?
L61125	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	I run this place! 
L61124	u3829	m253	MARTY	Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
L61123	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Dick? Dick who?
L61122	u3829	m253	MARTY	Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
L61120	u3829	m253	MARTY	Sure,.
L61119	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
L61114	u3829	m253	MARTY	A Tab.
L61113	u3835	m253	WAITRESS	What? 
L61112	u3829	m253	MARTY	Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
L61682	u3834	m253	SUZY	What did you do to yours?
L61681	u3829	m253	MARTY	What did you do to your hair?
L61680	u3834	m253	SUZY	Hi, Marty!
L61679	u3829	m253	MARTY	Suzy!
L61032	u3834	m253	SUZY	Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
L61031	u3829	m253	MARTY	Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
L61030	u3834	m253	SUZY	Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
L61029	u3829	m253	MARTY	No way!
L61028	u3834	m253	SUZY	Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
L61027	u3829	m253	MARTY	Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
L61026	u3834	m253	SUZY	No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
L61025	u3829	m253	MARTY	...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
L76638	u3961	m263	DAVID	I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
L76637	u3957	m263	ALISON	He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
L76633	u3957	m263	ALISON	No, I'm fine.
L76632	u3961	m263	DAVID	Here, let me do that.
L76627	u3961	m263	DAVID	Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
L76626	u3957	m263	ALISON	Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
L76620	u3961	m263	DAVID	I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
L76619	u3957	m263	ALISON	It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
L76618	u3961	m263	DAVID	shhh...
L76617	u3957	m263	ALISON	About Charles...
L76616	u3961	m263	DAVID	Everything's gonna be fine.
L76613	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
L76612	u3957	m263	ALISON	Let's get a coffee.
L76597	u3957	m263	ALISON	Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
L76596	u3961	m263	DAVID	Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
L76595	u3957	m263	ALISON	0 my god.
L76570	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ah, well .... CUT TO:
L76569	u3957	m263	ALISON	At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
L76345	u3957	m263	ALISON	Honestly David, you're so spineless.
L76344	u3961	m263	DAVID	I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
L76343	u3957	m263	ALISON	Meaning?
L76342	u3961	m263	DAVID	Sort of half.....
L76341	u3957	m263	ALISON	Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
L76339	u3957	m263	ALISON	Hi.....  Roses.
L76338	u3961	m263	DAVID	Hi,
L76257	u3957	m263	ALISON	Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
L76256	u3961	m263	DAVID	I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
L76255	u3957	m263	ALISON	David, I'm serious!
L76254	u3961	m263	DAVID	Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
L76251	u3961	m263	DAVID	It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
L76250	u3957	m263	ALISON	Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
L76245	u3957	m263	ALISON	Your face smells like a foot.
L76244	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ali?  What's wrong?
L76243	u3961	m263	DAVID	0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
L76242	u3957	m263	ALISON	Liar.
L76241	u3961	m263	DAVID	One.
L76240	u3957	m263	ALISON	There were three strawberries.
L76239	u3961	m263	DAVID	I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
L76238	u3957	m263	ALISON	Go ahead.
L76229	u3957	m263	ALISON	I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
L76228	u3961	m263	DAVID	Jesus.
L76226	u3961	m263	DAVID	I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
L76225	u3957	m263	ALISON	It isn't working any more, David.
L76217	u3957	m263	ALISON	What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
L76216	u3961	m263	DAVID	I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
L76215	u3957	m263	ALISON	Did you really ask?
L76214	u3961	m263	DAVID	Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
L76197	u3961	m263	DAVID	Tom Jones?
L76196	u3957	m263	ALISON	Scottish.
L76185	u3961	m263	DAVID	"That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."""
L76184	u3957	m263	ALISON	It's the last thing we need.
L76183	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
L76182	u3957	m263	ALISON	David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
L76181	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
L76180	u3957	m263	ALISON	Do we know anything about him?
L76178	u3961	m263	DAVID	I said I'd check with you.
L76177	u3957	m263	ALISON	And what did you say?
L76176	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
L76175	u3957	m263	ALISON	There aren't hotels?
L76174	u3961	m263	DAVID	And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
L76173	u3957	m263	ALISON	Yeeees?
L76172	u3961	m263	DAVID	Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
L76171	u3957	m263	ALISON	Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
L76163	u3957	m263	ALISON	Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
L76162	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
L76545	u3961	m263	DAVID	Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
L76544	u3958	m263	ANNIE	David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
L76470	u3961	m263	DAVID	Uh ... yes ...
L76469	u3958	m263	ANNIE	Big day today, huh? 78
L76310	u3958	m263	ANNIE	Night.
L76309	u3961	m263	DAVID	Goodnight Annie.
L76277	u3961	m263	DAVID	Thanks, Annie.
L76276	u3958	m263	ANNIE	Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
L76269	u3958	m263	ANNIE	I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
L76268	u3961	m263	DAVID	Right first time.
L76267	u3958	m263	ANNIE	He doesn't like to say much does he?
L76265	u3961	m263	DAVID	No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
L76264	u3958	m263	ANNIE	Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
L76263	u3961	m263	DAVID	Annie, it's me.
L76262	u3958	m263	ANNIE	Two dollars please.
L76446	u3959	m263	BEAN	Well, Ahm....
L76445	u3961	m263	DAVID	It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
L76425	u3961	m263	DAVID	Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
L76424	u3959	m263	BEAN	Oh yes.
L76410	u3959	m263	BEAN	Ahm.... .
L76409	u3961	m263	DAVID	What happened?!!!
L76408	u3959	m263	BEAN	oh dear.
L76407	u3961	m263	DAVID	Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
L76406	u3961	m263	DAVID	What?  What?
L76405	u3959	m263	BEAN	Ahm.....
L76404	u3961	m263	DAVID	Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
L76279	u3959	m263	BEAN	Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
L76278	u3961	m263	DAVID	Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
L76259	u3959	m263	BEAN	Excuse me.
L76258	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ah, Mr Bean ...
L76666	u3960	m263	BERNIE	I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
L76665	u3961	m263	DAVID	Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
L76532	u3961	m263	DAVID	Great - keep him out of trouble.
L76531	u3960	m263	BERNIE	He's just parking the Governor's car.
L76530	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
L76529	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Everything okay, David?
L76473	u3960	m263	BERNIE	You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
L76472	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
L76471	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
L76402	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
L76401	u3961	m263	DAVID	'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
L76399	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
L76398	u3961	m263	DAVID	Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
L76396	u3961	m263	DAVID	Isn't it?
L76395	u3960	m263	BERNIE	It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
L76394	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes, isn't he.
L76393	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
L76392	u3961	m263	DAVID	She's ... well, she's good.
L76391	u3960	m263	BERNIE	And howls Alison?
L76390	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
L76389	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Howls he getting on with the family?
L76388	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
L76387	u3960	m263	BERNIE	I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
L76295	u3960	m263	BERNIE	But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
L76294	u3961	m263	DAVID	It's very good Bernie.
L76642	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?  Well, the truth is - we can't.  So what am I saying?  Will we find her again?  Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
L76641	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
L76640	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
L76502	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
L76501	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
L76499	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
L76498	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	This is Elmer, our longest serving...
L76492	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Right.  Got it.
L76491	u3960	m263	BERNIE	And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
L76490	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
L76483	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
L76482	u3960	m263	BERNIE	We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
L76151	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	David?
L76150	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
L76149	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
L76145	u3960	m263	BERNIE	Great news.
L76144	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
L76609	u3962	m263	DOCTOR	Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
L76608	u3961	m263	DAVID	So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
L76607	u3961	m263	DAVID	We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
L76606	u3962	m263	DOCTOR	I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
L76605	u3961	m263	DAVID	I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
L76604	u3962	m263	DOCTOR	I beg your pardon?
L76603	u3961	m263	DAVID	Say that again, son.
L76680	u3961	m263	DAVID	And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
L76679	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	A car sounds sensible.
L76678	u3961	m263	DAVID	Maybe two cars.
L76677	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Mmmmm...
L76676	u3961	m263	DAVID	And a car.
L76675	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Of course.
L76674	u3961	m263	DAVID	VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
L76673	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
L76647	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
L76646	u3961	m263	DAVID	I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
L76645	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	David, David, David ...
L76481	u3961	m263	DAVID	Certainly is.
L76480	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
L76451	u3961	m263	DAVID	Quite right, sir.
L76450	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
L76449	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ahm....
L76448	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
L76430	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
L76429	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
L76428	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
L76427	u3961	m263	DAVID	... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
L76426	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
L76423	u3961	m263	DAVID	Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
L76422	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
L76421	u3961	m263	DAVID	The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
L76418	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Er ... pray tell me why?
L76417	u3961	m263	DAVID	No!
L76307	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
L76306	u3961	m263	DAVID	You're not going to ....
L76305	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
L76304	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
L76303	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
L76302	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
L76283	u3961	m263	DAVID	Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
L76282	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
L76156	u3961	m263	DAVID	No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
L76155	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
L76154	u3961	m263	DAVID	on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
L76153	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
L76152	u3961	m263	DAVID	Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
L76455	u3961	m263	DAVID	Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
L76454	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	Bye, Dad.
L76357	u3961	m263	DAVID	Sure.  You're right.
L76356	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	It's you and Mom that need to talk.
L76355	u3961	m263	DAVID	Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
L76249	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
L76248	u3961	m263	DAVID	Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
L76199	u3961	m263	DAVID	Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
L76198	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	Welsh again.
L76195	u3961	m263	DAVID	Sean Connery.
L76194	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	Welsh.
L76193	u3961	m263	DAVID	Richard Burton was very good-looking.
L76192	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
L76191	u3961	m263	DAVID	What makes you say that?
L76190	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
L76489	u3964	m263	ELMER	No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
L76488	u3961	m263	DAVID	They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
L76487	u3964	m263	ELMER	Sure did.
L76486	u3961	m263	DAVID	You arrange those flowers yourself?
L76377	u3964	m263	ELMER	"Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie"" and I'm ""Coochie-Coo"".  I'11 be back in 15."
L76376	u3961	m263	DAVID	You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
L76375	u3964	m263	ELMER	Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
L76374	u3961	m263	DAVID	As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
L76687	u3961	m263	DAVID	Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
L76686	u3967	m263	KEVIN	... in the distant future.
L76559	u3961	m263	DAVID	How the hell should I know?
L76558	u3967	m263	KEVIN	But is she gonna be okay?
L76557	u3961	m263	DAVID	She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
L76556	u3967	m263	KEVIN	Is Jenny gonna be okay?
L76461	u3961	m263	DAVID	Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
L76460	u3967	m263	KEVIN	Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
L76330	u3967	m263	KEVIN	I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
L76329	u3961	m263	DAVID	Well, there is that ...
L76328	u3967	m263	KEVIN	That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
L76327	u3961	m263	DAVID	He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
L76203	u3967	m263	KEVIN	I vote for Bart.
L76202	u3961	m263	DAVID	Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
L76201	u3967	m263	KEVIN	Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
L76187	u3961	m263	DAVID	Great, good.
L76186	u3967	m263	KEVIN	Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
L76576	u3963	m263	DOCTOR JACOBSON	Okay.....
L76575	u3968	m263	NURSE	It is urgent, sir.
L76574	u3963	m263	DOCTOR JACOBSON	Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
L76573	u3968	m263	NURSE	We need you urgently in C Theatre.
L76572	u3963	m263	DOCTOR JACOBSON	Yes?
L76571	u3968	m263	NURSE	Doctor Jacobson?
L76551	u3969	m263	REYNOLDS	And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
L76550	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	I am sorry you feel that way.
L76549	u3969	m263	REYNOLDS	I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
L76515	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
L76514	u3969	m263	REYNOLDS	off the peg?
L76513	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Why thank you sir.
L76512	u3969	m263	REYNOLDS	Interesting suit.
L76511	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.
L76510	u3969	m263	REYNOLDS	Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
L76509	u3965	m263	GRIERSON	what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
L76464	u3967	m263	KEVIN	Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
L76463	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	Come on Sting!
L76360	u3967	m263	KEVIN	Are you?
L76359	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	Of course he is.
L76358	u3967	m263	KEVIN	You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
L76354	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
L76353	u3967	m263	KEVIN	"I wish I could use that at school.  ""Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe""."
L76208	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	You.
L76207	u3967	m263	KEVIN	Nope.
L76206	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	You know the thing I hate most about children?
L76205	u3967	m263	KEVIN	NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
L76204	u3966	m263	JENNIFER	Shut up, Kevin.
L332224	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
L332223	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
L332222	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
L332221	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
L332003	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Where did the vehicles stop?
L332002	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Phones are out too.
L331990	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The monitors are failing.
L331989	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
L331988	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
L331987	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What now?
L331986	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
L331975	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
L331974	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The door security systems are shutting down.
L331973	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What?
L331964	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
L331963	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
L331962	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
L331957	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
L331956	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
L331917	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Damn!
L331916	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
L331912	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It's not worth taking the chance, John.
L331911	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You're sure we have to?
L331910	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
L331879	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Stop the program!  Stop the program!
L331878	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
L332242	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	'Bout thirty seconds.
L332241	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How long will this take?
L332232	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
L332231	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How would we cut off the lysine?
L332230	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
L332226	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
L332225	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But would we get the phones back?
L332220	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
L332219	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
L332077	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
L332076	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - about two million.
L332075	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How many lines of code are there?
L332074	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What one?
L332073	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
L332072	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
L331626	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
L331625	u6162	m411	DODGSON	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
L331624	u6171	m411	NEDRY	That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
L331623	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
L331622	u6171	m411	NEDRY	What?  No menthol?
L331620	u6171	m411	NEDRY	How am I supposed to transport them?
L331619	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
L331618	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Oh, I'll get 'em all.
L331616	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
L331615	u6162	m411	DODGSON	You shouldn't use my name.
L331950	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
L331949	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
L331887	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
L331886	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
L331883	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
L331882	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
L331781	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
L331780	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
L331676	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Shhhhh!
L331675	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
L331952	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
L331951	u6167	m411	HARDING	Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
L331907	u6167	m411	HARDING	You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
L331906	u6163	m411	ELLIE	There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
L331905	u6167	m411	HARDING	Pretty sure.
L331904	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are you sure?
L331903	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
L331902	u6163	m411	ELLIE	That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
L331901	u6167	m411	HARDING	They are?  I'll be damned.
L331900	u6163	m411	ELLIE	These are dilated.  Take a look.
L331899	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
L331898	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Six weeks?
L331897	u6167	m411	HARDING	Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
L332312	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
L332311	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
L332310	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
L332286	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Look.
L332285	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
L332284	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why?
L332283	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But you know, I should  really be the one going .
L332274	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John....
L332273	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
L332192	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
L332191	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Once we have control again we - -
L332190	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
L332188	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
L332187	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
L332186	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	"A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  ""I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... "

L331580	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anything else, you old fossil?

L331572	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Cheap, cheap, cheap.

L331570	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
L331569	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
L331568	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
L331560	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
L331559	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
L331543	u6165	m411	GRANT	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
L331542	u6163	m411	ELLIE	A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
L331541	u6163	m411	ELLIE	If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
L331540	u6165	m411	GRANT	The taphonomy sure looks that way.
L331539	u6163	m411	ELLIE	They died together?
L331538	u6165	m411	GRANT	Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
L332305	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Like hell it is!
L332304	u6170	m411	MULDOON	It's all right.
L332303	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
L332302	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why not?
L332301	u6170	m411	MULDOON	No. We can't.
L332300	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
L332299	u6170	m411	MULDOON	C'mon on, this way.
L332298	u6170	m411	MULDOON	The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
L332297	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.  Aw, God.
L332296	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Stick to my heels.
L332295	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm on channel two.
L332288	u6163	m411	ELLIE	We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
L332287	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Come on, let's go.
L332280	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay.
L332279	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I'm going with you.
L332277	u6170	m411	MULDOON	You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
L332276	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
L332228	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What's that?
L332227	u6170	m411	MULDOON	What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
L332136	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They're not here.
L332135	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?!
L332134	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I don't know.
L332133	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Do you see anything?
L332132	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan!
L332131	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Dr. Grant!
L332130	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The other car!
L332129	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Ellie, com one!!
L332128	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No, no, no!
L331758	u6170	m411	MULDOON	That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
L331757	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The fences are electrified, right?
L331756	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
L332248	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
L332247	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - shut up.
L332246	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes?
L332238	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
L332237	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
L332148	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
L332147	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
L332146	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
L332145	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster, faster!
L332124	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Please - - chance it.
L332123	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Can we chance moving him?
L331909	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yeah.
L331908	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dino droppings?
L331874	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331873	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
L331872	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331871	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
L331870	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Unpredictability....
L331869	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
L331868	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, imperfections?
L331867	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
L331866	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan, listen to this.
L331865	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
L331864	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
L331862	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
L331861	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'm still not clear on Chaos.
L331860	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
L331851	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
L331850	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
L331735	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anti-nature.
L331734	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It's anti-nature.
L331733	u6163	m411	ELLIE	When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
L331732	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And scary.
L331731	u6163	m411	ELLIE	And scary.
L331730	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I know, it's very exciting.
L331729	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I get ah - -
L331728	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That's right.  Will break through.
L331639	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
L331638	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No.
L331536	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
L331535	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Why not?
L331534	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
L331533	u6164	m411	GENNARO	If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
L331530	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
L331529	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
L331528	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
L331527	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
L331526	u6164	m411	GENNARO	You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
L331525	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He sends his apologies.
L331524	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What's this I hear at the airport? Hammond's not even here?
L331523	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hola, bienvenido
L331522	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hola, Juanito
L332023	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
L332022	u6173	m411	TIM	Yeah.
L332021	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Are they heavy?
L332020	u6173	m411	TIM	In a box under my seat.
L332019	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where did you find those things?
L332015	u6173	m411	TIM	People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
L332014	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
L332013	u6173	m411	TIM	Up and down, up and down!
L331829	u6173	m411	TIM	Dilophosaurus.
L331828	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What are we looking for?
L331827	u6173	m411	TIM	I can't see.
L331799	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
L331798	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where are the brakes?
L331797	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
L331785	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Thank you.
L331784	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
L331766	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
L331765	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
L331764	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
L331763	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
L331762	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
L331761	u6164	m411	GENNARO	And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
L331701	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
L331700	u6164	m411	GENNARO	John, we - - what I'm just saying....
L331689	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
L331688	u6164	m411	GENNARO	This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
L331645	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
L331644	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
L331643	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
L331642	u6164	m411	GENNARO	The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
L332330	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
L332329	u6173	m411	TIM	Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
L332325	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
L332324	u6173	m411	TIM	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
L332323	u6165	m411	GRANT	Go, go, go, jump!
L332320	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
L332319	u6173	m411	TIM	I can't!  I'm scared!
L332290	u6173	m411	TIM	Nope.
L332289	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
L332216	u6165	m411	GRANT	Amphibian DNA.

L332107	u6165	m411	GRANT	Maybe -- it's hard to say.
L332106	u6173	m411	TIM	I doubt it.
L332105	u6165	m411	GRANT	You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --

L332099	u6165	m411	GRANT	So am I going to help you with your foot?
L332098	u6173	m411	TIM	This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.

L332096	u6173	m411	TIM	No.
L332095	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?

L332008	u6165	m411	GRANT	What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
L332007	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Kids get scared.
L332006	u6165	m411	GRANT	Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?

L332372	u6165	m411	GRANT	Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
L331789	u6165	m411	GRANT	"What does he mean by ""target audience""?"
L331788	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
L331787	u6165	m411	GRANT	Who?
L331786	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Ah - - they're here.

L331694	u6165	m411	GRANT	Can't you stop these things?!
L331657	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
L331656	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
L331655	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
L331654	u6165	m411	GRANT	That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
L331612	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	For a further three years.
L331611	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
L331610	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
L331609	u6165	m411	GRANT	No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
L331608	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
L331605	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
L331604	u6165	m411	GRANT	What kind of opinions?
L331603	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
L331602	u6165	m411	GRANT	I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
L331601	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?

L332218	u6165	m411	GRANT	Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!

L332052	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim!  Lex!
L332255	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"Wait a minute?  What do you mean ""worked""?  Everything is still off!"
L332254	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
L332244	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have ""thinktelligence.""  You think narrowly and call it ""being focused.""  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions."
L332243	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
L331779	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
L331778	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
L331777	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
L331776	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
L331775	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
L331774	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
L331772	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
L331771	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
L331723	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
L331722	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Your silence intrigues me.
L331637	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
L331636	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Don't do that!
L331635	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, John.
L331634	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
L331633	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
L331632	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
L331631	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
L331630	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
L331629	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
L331844	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Thanks, Dad.
L331843	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
L331842	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
L331841	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
L331840	u6171	m411	NEDRY	You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
L331839	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
L331838	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
L332079	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Sure.
L332078	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
L332070	u6170	m411	MULDOON	There's no sign of him anywhere.

L403532	u6744	m450	ALFRED	Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
L403531	u6760	m450	VADA	No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
L403530	u6744	m450	ALFRED	Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
L403529	u6760	m450	VADA	I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
L403528	u6744	m450	ALFRED	I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
L403527	u6760	m450	VADA	People said she looked like me.
L403524	u6744	m450	ALFRED	Ohhhhh.
L403523	u6760	m450	VADA	Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
L403522	u6744	m450	ALFRED	UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
L403521	u6760	m450	VADA	My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
L403520	u6744	m450	ALFRED	No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
L403519	u6760	m450	VADA	Do you still teach?
L403518	u6744	m450	ALFRED	Oh, just put it over there.
L403517	u6760	m450	VADA	Umm, where do you want this?
L403510	u6744	m450	ALFRED	No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
L403509	u6760	m450	VADA	Are you writing a poem?
L403508	u6744	m450	ALFRED	You had to remind me?
L403295	u6760	m450	VADA	I don't even know your name.
L403294	u6745	m450	BOY	Don't mention it.
L403293	u6760	m450	VADA	THANK YOU.
L403292	u6745	m450	BOY	Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
L403291	u6760	m450	VADA	I don't think you're very polite.
L403290	u6745	m450	BOY	What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
L403289	u6760	m450	VADA	Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
L403288	u6760	m450	VADA	Gee, that is a problem.
L403287	u6745	m450	BOY	My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
L403286	u6760	m450	VADA	Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
L403285	u6745	m450	BOY	Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
L403284	u6760	m450	VADA	This is California, anything is possible.
L403283	u6745	m450	BOY	Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
L403282	u6760	m450	VADA	Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
L403281	u6745	m450	BOY	Your Uncle Phil told me.
L403280	u6760	m450	VADA	How did you know my name?
L403279	u6745	m450	BOY	You're Vada right?
L403278	u6760	m450	VADA	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
L403277	u6745	m450	BOY	Excuse me I asked you a question.
L403746	u6746	m450	DARYL	Me, I'll know!
L403745	u6754	m450	NICK	So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
L403738	u6746	m450	DARYL	You're still asking me to break the law.
L403737	u6754	m450	NICK	I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
L403736	u6746	m450	DARYL	I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
L403735	u6754	m450	NICK	Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
L403734	u6746	m450	DARYL	I thought I told you to lose this guy.
L403733	u6754	m450	NICK	Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
L403427	u6746	m450	DARYL	What about living in the real world pal?
L403426	u6754	m450	NICK	What about giving the other guy a break.
L403425	u6746	m450	DARYL	Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
L403422	u6746	m450	DARYL	I would do it again in a minute.
L403421	u6754	m450	NICK	What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
L403748	u6746	m450	DARYL	Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
L403747	u6760	m450	VADA	Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
L403744	u6746	m450	DARYL	Could you hold on for a second? 
L403743	u6760	m450	VADA	I'm leaving Sunday.
L403742	u6746	m450	DARYL	Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
L403741	u6760	m450	VADA	Pommeroy.
L403740	u6746	m450	DARYL	Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
L403732	u6760	m450	VADA	His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
L403731	u6746	m450	DARYL	I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
L403420	u6746	m450	DARYL	Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
L403419	u6760	m450	VADA	Suspended from school, my mother??
L403418	u6746	m450	DARYL	She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
L403415	u6746	m450	DARYL	You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
L403414	u6760	m450	VADA	Wow, you walked out with my mother?
L403413	u6746	m450	DARYL	Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
L403412	u6760	m450	VADA	What do you remember about her.
L403411	u6746	m450	DARYL	It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
L403887	u6747	m450	HARRY	You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
L403886	u6760	m450	VADA	Can I see him?
L403885	u6747	m450	HARRY	Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
L403884	u6760	m450	VADA	We have a baby?
L403883	u6747	m450	HARRY	She just had a baby that's all.
L403882	u6760	m450	VADA	What happened to Shelly?
L403727	u6760	m450	VADA	Give my love to Shelly.
L403726	u6747	m450	HARRY	I love you too sweetie, bye.
L403725	u6760	m450	VADA	Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
L403724	u6747	m450	HARRY	Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
L403723	u6760	m450	VADA	I will. How's Shelly?
L403722	u6747	m450	HARRY	Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
L403721	u6760	m450	VADA	Totally.
L403720	u6747	m450	HARRY	Totally groovy huh?
L403719	u6760	m450	VADA	Yeah.
L403716	u6760	m450	VADA	Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
L403715	u6747	m450	HARRY	Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
L403714	u6760	m450	VADA	I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
L403713	u6747	m450	HARRY	Hi honey.
L403712	u6760	m450	VADA	Hi Dad.
L403711	u6747	m450	HARRY	Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
L403272	u6747	m450	HARRY	Have fun.
L403271	u6760	m450	VADA	I'll be back in 137 hours.
L403270	u6747	m450	HARRY	Thanks, I needed that.
L403269	u6760	m450	VADA	Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
L403268	u6747	m450	HARRY	It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
L403267	u6760	m450	VADA	What does that mean?
L403266	u6747	m450	HARRY	And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
L403265	u6760	m450	VADA	No nuns, got it.
L403252	u6760	m450	VADA	I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
L403251	u6747	m450	HARRY	What??
L403250	u6760	m450	VADA	I already bought a ticket.
L403249	u6747	m450	HARRY	Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
L403248	u6760	m450	VADA	I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
L403247	u6747	m450	HARRY	Of course.
L403246	u6760	m450	VADA	You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
L403188	u6747	m450	HARRY	Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
L403187	u6760	m450	VADA	Was it a nice funeral?
L403186	u6747	m450	HARRY	She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
L403183	u6747	m450	HARRY	Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
L403182	u6760	m450	VADA	Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
L403181	u6747	m450	HARRY	Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
L403180	u6760	m450	VADA	There's still a big spot on the floor.
L403144	u6747	m450	HARRY	Her favorite poet.
L403143	u6760	m450	VADA	The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
L403124	u6747	m450	HARRY	Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
L403123	u6760	m450	VADA	So you're saying...What are you saying??
L403118	u6760	m450	VADA	It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
L403117	u6747	m450	HARRY	What boy likes you?
L403116	u6760	m450	VADA	Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
L403090	u6747	m450	HARRY	Great.
L403089	u6760	m450	VADA	Seriously.
L403088	u6747	m450	HARRY	Seriously?
L403087	u6760	m450	VADA	Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
L403086	u6747	m450	HARRY	Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
L403085	u6760	m450	VADA	Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
L403084	u6747	m450	HARRY	Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
L403083	u6760	m450	VADA	Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
L403082	u6747	m450	HARRY	Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
L403081	u6760	m450	VADA	No it's okay, I understand, really.
L403080	u6747	m450	HARRY	Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
L403078	u6760	m450	VADA	I figured you did.
L403077	u6747	m450	HARRY	She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
L403076	u6760	m450	VADA	Shelly's already told me all about sex.
L403075	u6747	m450	HARRY	No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
L403074	u6760	m450	VADA	You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
L403073	u6747	m450	HARRY	Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
L403072	u6760	m450	VADA	So, what's on your mind?
L403071	u6747	m450	HARRY	Well you know what I mean.
L403070	u6760	m450	VADA	Visualize a spare?
L403063	u6747	m450	HARRY	Okay thanks, atta girl.
L403062	u6760	m450	VADA	Okay, no problem.
L403061	u6747	m450	HARRY	Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
L403060	u6760	m450	VADA	You want me to move?
L403059	u6747	m450	HARRY	Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
L403058	u6760	m450	VADA	Do what?
L403054	u6760	m450	VADA	I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
L403053	u6747	m450	HARRY	I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
L403035	u6760	m450	VADA	Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
L403034	u6747	m450	HARRY	Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
L403901	u6747	m450	HARRY	Maybe he's hungry.
L403900	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Maybe he's wet?
L403893	u6758	m450	SHELLY	I was pushing as fast as I could.
L403892	u6747	m450	HARRY	I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
L403261	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
L403260	u6747	m450	HARRY	Reason? What reason?
L403257	u6747	m450	HARRY	I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
L403256	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
L403255	u6747	m450	HARRY	Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
L403244	u6758	m450	SHELLY	You're being narrow-minded.
L403243	u6747	m450	HARRY	Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
L403242	u6758	m450	SHELLY	She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
L403241	u6747	m450	HARRY	She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
L403176	u6747	m450	HARRY	Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
L403175	u6758	m450	SHELLY	No.
L403174	u6747	m450	HARRY	I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
L403147	u6758	m450	SHELLY	And some taco chips so I can dunk.
L403146	u6747	m450	HARRY	How about a nice glass of milk?
L403145	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Never heard of him. 
L403142	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
L403141	u6747	m450	HARRY	Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
L403122	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
L403121	u6747	m450	HARRY	Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
L403067	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
L403066	u6747	m450	HARRY	Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
L403056	u6747	m450	HARRY	Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
L403055	u6758	m450	SHELLY	I don't know if I want to.
L403030	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Then I'll throw up a little bit.
L403029	u6747	m450	HARRY	Well you should at least try a little bit.
L403028	u6758	m450	SHELLY	If I eat it I'll throw up.
L403027	u6747	m450	HARRY	Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
L403695	u6760	m450	VADA	They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
L403694	u6748	m450	HILLARY	Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
L403693	u6760	m450	VADA	Are you saying my mother had another husband?
L403692	u6748	m450	HILLARY	Ummmmm, look, I...I...
L403691	u6760	m450	VADA	What're you saying?
L403690	u6748	m450	HILLARY	Oh.  Ohhh?
L403689	u6760	m450	VADA	His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
L403685	u6748	m450	HILLARY	I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
L403684	u6760	m450	VADA	Thanks.
L403679	u6748	m450	HILLARY	I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
L403678	u6760	m450	VADA	It's okay really, I was just a baby.
L403675	u6748	m450	HILLARY	Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
L403674	u6760	m450	VADA	Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
L403832	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
L403831	u6760	m450	VADA	oh.
L403830	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
L403829	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
L403828	u6760	m450	VADA	Well...
L403827	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
L403826	u6760	m450	VADA	I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
L403825	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	I'd say you turned out just fine.
L403824	u6760	m450	VADA	I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
L403823	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
L403822	u6760	m450	VADA	Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
L403821	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
L403820	u6760	m450	VADA	More than anything in the world.
L403819	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
L403817	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
L403816	u6760	m450	VADA	She's beautiful.
L403812	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	I've got something better.
L403811	u6760	m450	VADA	Do you have any pictures if her?
L403810	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
L403809	u6760	m450	VADA	And she saved it.
L403806	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	I'll try.
L403805	u6760	m450	VADA	I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
L403804	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
L403803	u6760	m450	VADA	Special effects?
L403802	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
L403801	u6760	m450	VADA	I told you it was a long story.
L403799	u6760	m450	VADA	Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
L403798	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
L403797	u6760	m450	VADA	We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
L403796	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Yeah, come on, let's talk.
L403795	u6760	m450	VADA	You are?
L403794	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	I'm glad you're here.
L403793	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Does she?
L403792	u6760	m450	VADA	Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
L403783	u6760	m450	VADA	I'd like to, thanks.
L403782	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Umm...can you come in for a minute?
L403775	u6760	m450	VADA	You mean, you knew about me?
L403774	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
L403773	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
L403772	u6760	m450	VADA	I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
L403771	u6749	m450	JEFFREY	Sure am, who are you?
L403208	u6760	m450	VADA	Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
L403207	u6750	m450	JUDY	So she had you in jail, in Russia?
L403202	u6760	m450	VADA	Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
L403201	u6750	m450	JUDY	Then what did she do?
L403128	u6750	m450	JUDY	ehh...I don't know I mean....
L403127	u6760	m450	VADA	Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
L403126	u6750	m450	JUDY	Hi.
L403107	u6750	m450	JUDY	I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
L403106	u6760	m450	VADA	That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
L403105	u6750	m450	JUDY	Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
L403104	u6760	m450	VADA	Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
L403103	u6750	m450	JUDY	He likes you.
L403102	u6760	m450	VADA	What's the matter?
L403098	u6750	m450	JUDY	Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
L403097	u6760	m450	VADA	See you? He can smell you from there.
L403096	u6750	m450	JUDY	It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
L403095	u6760	m450	VADA	What are you staring at?
L403093	u6760	m450	VADA	Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
L403092	u6750	m450	JUDY	My mother can't have any more kids.
L403050	u6760	m450	VADA	You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
L403049	u6750	m450	JUDY	I know that.
L403048	u6760	m450	VADA	It's just a corpse.
L403047	u6750	m450	JUDY	That's okay.
L403046	u6760	m450	VADA	Come on in!
L403045	u6750	m450	JUDY	Hi.
L403206	u6760	m450	VADA	That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
L403205	u6751	m450	KEVIN	All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
L403204	u6760	m450	VADA	No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
L403203	u6751	m450	KEVIN	Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
L403200	u6760	m450	VADA	No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
L403199	u6751	m450	KEVIN	You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
L403198	u6760	m450	VADA	But I wanna write about her.
L403197	u6751	m450	KEVIN	Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
L403131	u6751	m450	KEVIN	Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
L403130	u6760	m450	VADA	It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
L403129	u6751	m450	KEVIN	Is it okay if I drink this?

L403162	u6753	m450	MR. OWETT	Vada?
L403637	u6756	m450	ROSE	You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.

L403537	u6754	m450	NICK	Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
L403515	u6760	m450	VADA	At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
L403514	u6754	m450	NICK	If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
L403503	u6760	m450	VADA	He is one of the great poets.
L403502	u6754	m450	NICK	Boy, you're really into this.
L403478	u6760	m450	VADA	May I use the phone please.
L403477	u6754	m450	NICK	Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
L403434	u6754	m450	NICK	You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
L403433	u6760	m450	VADA	You would.
L403432	u6754	m450	NICK	I think it's cool.
L403431	u6760	m450	VADA	This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
L403430	u6754	m450	NICK	Care for a smoke?
L403424	u6754	m450	NICK	Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
L403423	u6760	m450	VADA	You ratted on my mother??
L403417	u6760	m450	VADA	Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
L403416	u6754	m450	NICK	You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
L403405	u6760	m450	VADA	Why do you argue with everything I say?
L403404	u6754	m450	NICK	What if you don't wanna be found?
L403403	u6760	m450	VADA	I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
L403402	u6754	m450	NICK	What, you think the guy should change his name?
L403401	u6760	m450	VADA	Change my name.
L403400	u6754	m450	NICK	Get married?
L403399	u6760	m450	VADA	I'd never do that.
L403398	u6754	m450	NICK	Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
L403395	u6754	m450	NICK	I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
L403394	u6760	m450	VADA	It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
L403393	u6754	m450	NICK	Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
L403392	u6760	m450	VADA	Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
L403391	u6760	m450	VADA	Oh my gosh, here it is!
L403390	u6754	m450	NICK	A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
L403389	u6760	m450	VADA	What difference does it make?
L403388	u6754	m450	NICK	I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
L403387	u6760	m450	VADA	Just remember the needle in the haystack.
L403386	u6754	m450	NICK	I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
L403378	u6754	m450	NICK	Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
L403377	u6760	m450	VADA	WHAT??
L403376	u6754	m450	NICK	Vada.
L403375	u6760	m450	VADA	It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
L403374	u6754	m450	NICK	They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
L403371	u6760	m450	VADA	Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
L403370	u6754	m450	NICK	Getting off please.
L403369	u6760	m450	VADA	Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
L403368	u6754	m450	NICK	I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
L403367	u6760	m450	VADA	I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
L403366	u6754	m450	NICK	You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
L403346	u6760	m450	VADA	I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
L403345	u6754	m450	NICK	And you're gonna solve the mystery?
L403344	u6760	m450	VADA	My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
L403306	u6754	m450	NICK	TAXI!!!
L403305	u6760	m450	VADA	I don't need you to be telling me to...
L403304	u6754	m450	NICK	Yeah, RIGHT.
L403303	u6760	m450	VADA	He said it was a gift.
L403302	u6754	m450	NICK	No THANKS!
L403301	u6760	m450	VADA	Thanks....
L403363	u6754	m450	NICK	Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
L403362	u6755	m450	PHIL	You're a good man Nicholas.
L403361	u6754	m450	NICK	No problem.
L403360	u6755	m450	PHIL	Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
L403359	u6754	m450	NICK	Wow!
L403358	u6755	m450	PHIL	For the mini-bike fund.
L403357	u6754	m450	NICK	What's it for?
L403356	u6755	m450	PHIL	Ten bucks.
L403355	u6754	m450	NICK	What's that?
L403352	u6755	m450	PHIL	I'd consider it a personal favor.
L403351	u6754	m450	NICK	Muh??
L403848	u6755	m450	PHIL	Rose this not the place to be having this...
L403847	u6757	m450	SAM	I don't think the color of the interior is....
L403846	u6755	m450	PHIL	You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
L403845	u6757	m450	SAM	And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
L403841	u6757	m450	SAM	Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
L403840	u6755	m450	PHIL	Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
L403839	u6757	m450	SAM	I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
L403838	u6755	m450	PHIL	Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
L403659	u6757	m450	SAM	Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
L403658	u6755	m450	PHIL	Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
L403463	u6755	m450	PHIL	Was Rose.
L403462	u6757	m450	SAM	Well Rose was being very thorough.
L403858	u6755	m450	PHIL	Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
L403857	u6760	m450	VADA	Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
L403856	u6755	m450	PHIL	No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
L403767	u6760	m450	VADA	Okay.
L403766	u6755	m450	PHIL	Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
L403765	u6760	m450	VADA	I should do this myself.
L403764	u6755	m450	PHIL	You want me to come with?
L403763	u6760	m450	VADA	Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
L403762	u6755	m450	PHIL	This is it I guess.
L403761	u6760	m450	VADA	A secret, I like that.
L403760	u6755	m450	PHIL	Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
L403759	u6760	m450	VADA	Maybe.
L403758	u6755	m450	PHIL	I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
L403757	u6760	m450	VADA	Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
L403754	u6755	m450	PHIL	Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
L403753	u6760	m450	VADA	I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
L403752	u6755	m450	PHIL	How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
L403751	u6760	m450	VADA	I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
L403710	u6760	m450	VADA	Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
L403709	u6755	m450	PHIL	Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
L403604	u6760	m450	VADA	Bye.
L403603	u6755	m450	PHIL	Lock the door.
L403350	u6755	m450	PHIL	I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
L403349	u6760	m450	VADA	I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
L403341	u6755	m450	PHIL	Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
L403340	u6760	m450	VADA	Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
L403339	u6755	m450	PHIL	Yes, it does.
L403338	u6760	m450	VADA	So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
L403337	u6755	m450	PHIL	Committed.
L403336	u6760	m450	VADA	Committed?
L403335	u6755	m450	PHIL	That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
L403334	u6760	m450	VADA	Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
L403333	u6755	m450	PHIL	Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
L403332	u6760	m450	VADA	But...are you engaged or something?
L403331	u6755	m450	PHIL	Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
L403330	u6760	m450	VADA	She lives here too?
L403317	u6755	m450	PHIL	Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
L403316	u6760	m450	VADA	He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
L403315	u6755	m450	PHIL	How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
L403314	u6760	m450	VADA	They're great.
L403313	u6755	m450	PHIL	Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
L403853	u6755	m450	PHIL	Is that a yes?
L403852	u6756	m450	ROSE	You really think I look sexy in this smock?
L403851	u6756	m450	ROSE	You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
L403850	u6755	m450	PHIL	You know how I feel about you.
L403849	u6756	m450	ROSE	I think this place is just fine.
L403844	u6756	m450	ROSE	I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
L403843	u6755	m450	PHIL	You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
L403842	u6756	m450	ROSE	Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
L403669	u6756	m450	ROSE	No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
L403668	u6755	m450	PHIL	Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
L403667	u6756	m450	ROSE	I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
L403666	u6755	m450	PHIL	Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
L403598	u6755	m450	PHIL	You know where the fire extinguisher is.
L403597	u6756	m450	ROSE	There's plenty of fruit.
L403596	u6755	m450	PHIL	We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
L403480	u6755	m450	PHIL	Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
L403479	u6756	m450	ROSE	Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
L403476	u6756	m450	ROSE	Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
L403475	u6755	m450	PHIL	Hi!
L403474	u6756	m450	ROSE	Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
L403473	u6755	m450	PHIL	Oh...what's that?
L403472	u6755	m450	PHIL	God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
L403471	u6756	m450	ROSE	Phil for God sake.
L403470	u6755	m450	PHIL	He was caressing.
L403469	u6756	m450	ROSE	He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
L403468	u6755	m450	PHIL	What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
L403461	u6755	m450	PHIL	Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
L403460	u6756	m450	ROSE	No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
L403348	u6756	m450	ROSE	Sounds like you're very organized.
L403347	u6755	m450	PHIL	Then you'll be all set.
L403328	u6755	m450	PHIL	Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
L403327	u6756	m450	ROSE	Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
L403326	u6755	m450	PHIL	Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
L403860	u6756	m450	ROSE	Bye Niece, Vada.
L403859	u6760	m450	VADA	Bye Aunt Rose.
L403730	u6760	m450	VADA	Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
L403729	u6756	m450	ROSE	She'll be all right baby.
L403728	u6760	m450	VADA	Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
L403642	u6756	m450	ROSE	Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
L403641	u6760	m450	VADA	Not exactly.
L403640	u6756	m450	ROSE	Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
L403602	u6756	m450	ROSE	All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
L403601	u6760	m450	VADA	I'm just tired.
L403324	u6756	m450	ROSE	What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
L403323	u6760	m450	VADA	You're Nick's mother?
L403663	u6757	m450	SAM	I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
L403662	u6756	m450	ROSE	Oh, sure okay.
L403661	u6757	m450	SAM	Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
L403657	u6757	m450	SAM	Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
L403656	u6756	m450	ROSE	Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
L403655	u6757	m450	SAM	All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
L403654	u6756	m450	ROSE	Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
L403653	u6757	m450	SAM	Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
L403652	u6756	m450	ROSE	Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
L403651	u6757	m450	SAM	Sort of?
L403650	u6756	m450	ROSE	Well I'm sort of involved.
L403649	u6757	m450	SAM	You couldn't?
L403648	u6756	m450	ROSE	Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
L403647	u6757	m450	SAM	Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
L403646	u6756	m450	ROSE	Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
L403645	u6757	m450	SAM	Something wrong?
L403644	u6756	m450	ROSE	Well maybe for you.
L403643	u6757	m450	SAM	Good morning.
L403465	u6757	m450	SAM	I'll be here.
L403464	u6756	m450	ROSE	Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
L403458	u6757	m450	SAM	...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
L403457	u6756	m450	ROSE	Yes, I do.
L403456	u6757	m450	SAM	...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
L403455	u6757	m450	SAM	Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
L403454	u6756	m450	ROSE	Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
L403453	u6757	m450	SAM	I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

L403451	u6757	m450	SAM	I was commenting on your hair.

L403895	u6758	m450	SHELLY	You have no idea.
L403894	u6760	m450	VADA	Did it hurt a lot?
L403891	u6758	m450	SHELLY	I know, look at his little hands.
L403890	u6760	m450	VADA	He's so tiny.
L403889	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Hey! Oh look.
L403888	u6760	m450	VADA	Shelly?
L403238	u6758	m450	SHELLY	You leave your father to me.
L403237	u6760	m450	VADA	But Dad'll never go for it.
L403236	u6758	m450	SHELLY	It would be fantastic.
L403235	u6760	m450	VADA	Yeah, it would be kinda great.
L403234	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
L403233	u6760	m450	VADA	But what about you and the baby? You need me.
L403232	u6758	m450	SHELLY	How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
L403231	u6760	m450	VADA	What do you mean?
L403230	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Why not now?
L403229	u6760	m450	VADA	I'm definitely traveling some day.
L403228	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Well you've gotta be prepared.
L403227	u6760	m450	VADA	I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
L403226	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
L403225	u6760	m450	VADA	Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
L403224	u6758	m450	SHELLY	No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
L403223	u6760	m450	VADA	Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
L403222	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
L403221	u6760	m450	VADA	This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
L403220	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
L403219	u6760	m450	VADA	I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
L403218	u6758	m450	SHELLY	What's this? December 8th, 1958?
L403185	u6760	m450	VADA	Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
L403184	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
L403178	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Oh no.
L403177	u6760	m450	VADA	Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
L403156	u6760	m450	VADA	You're telling me.
L403155	u6758	m450	SHELLY	I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
L403154	u6760	m450	VADA	Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
L403153	u6758	m450	SHELLY	Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
L403152	u6760	m450	VADA	When did you umm, I mean umm...
L403151	u6758	m450	SHELLY	No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
L403150	u6760	m450	VADA	Is there milk in them already?
L403149	u6758	m450	SHELLY	They're enormous, I know.
L403140	u6758	m450	SHELLY	I bet your mom sang to you.
L403139	u6760	m450	VADA	Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
L403501	u6760	m450	VADA	This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
L403500	u6759	m450	STANLEY	I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
L403499	u6760	m450	VADA	Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
L403498	u6759	m450	STANLEY	No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
L403496	u6760	m450	VADA	He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
L403495	u6759	m450	STANLEY	Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
L403494	u6760	m450	VADA	Do you know him?
L403493	u6759	m450	STANLEY	He is?
L403492	u6760	m450	VADA	He's a great poet.
L403491	u6759	m450	STANLEY	Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
L403490	u6760	m450	VADA	Beidermeyer?
L403489	u6759	m450	STANLEY	Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
L403488	u6760	m450	VADA	Really?
L402249	u6761	m451	ARTHUR	No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
L402248	u6772	m451	VADA	Wanna play?
L402096	u6761	m451	ARTHUR	I like to buy off all the railroads.
L402095	u6772	m451	VADA	Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
L402094	u6761	m451	ARTHUR	Good for you baby.
L402093	u6772	m451	VADA	I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
L402092	u6761	m451	ARTHUR	Vada!!
L402091	u6772	m451	VADA	Arthur!!
L402076	u6772	m451	VADA	Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
L402075	u6762	m451	BOY#2	Of what??
L402067	u6762	m451	BOY#2	All right, here.
L402066	u6772	m451	VADA	You're such a baby.
L402065	u6762	m451	BOY#2	How do I know you were gonna show us one?
L402064	u6772	m451	VADA	Hey, you didn't pay me!
L402063	u6772	m451	VADA	Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
L402062	u6762	m451	BOY#2	Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
L402635	u6763	m451	DANNY	Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
L402634	u6765	m451	HARRY	It's her home! It's where she lives!!
L402633	u6763	m451	DANNY	Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
L402630	u6763	m451	DANNY	This guy bonking you?
L402629	u6765	m451	HARRY	Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
L402628	u6763	m451	DANNY	WHAT?
L402627	u6765	m451	HARRY	Danny?
L402621	u6763	m451	DANNY	Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
L402620	u6765	m451	HARRY	Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
L402623	u6763	m451	DANNY	My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
L402622	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Ex...ex, ex...
L402616	u6763	m451	DANNY	Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
L402615	u6770	m451	SHELLY	This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
L402614	u6763	m451	DANNY	Yeah, all right...
L402613	u6770	m451	SHELLY	God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
L402612	u6763	m451	DANNY	I'm impressed.
L402611	u6770	m451	SHELLY	The boss is watching us...
L402610	u6763	m451	DANNY	What?
L402609	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Keep your voice down!
L402608	u6763	m451	DANNY	Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
L402607	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
L402604	u6763	m451	DANNY	You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
L402603	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
L402602	u6763	m451	DANNY	What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
L402898	u6772	m451	VADA	The bee stings! I can't breathe!
L402897	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	What Hurts Vada?
L402896	u6772	m451	VADA	It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
L402895	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
L402894	u6772	m451	VADA	I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
L402893	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
L402892	u6772	m451	VADA	Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
L402675	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
L402674	u6772	m451	VADA	It's there.
L402673	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	No.
L402672	u6772	m451	VADA	Can't you see it?
L402161	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
L402160	u6772	m451	VADA	Yes.
L402159	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
L402158	u6772	m451	VADA	That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
L402157	u6764	m451	DR WELTY	You are perfectly healthy.
L402923	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
L402922	u6765	m451	HARRY	Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
L402921	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
L402920	u6765	m451	HARRY	I know that, but what do you want from me?
L402919	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
L402730	u6765	m451	HARRY	I don't know which ball's mine.
L402729	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Perfect.
L402728	u6765	m451	HARRY	Watch you don't knock out a fish.
L402655	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
L402654	u6765	m451	HARRY	Did you ahh, love him?
L402653	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Pointing upwards Look...
L402652	u6765	m451	HARRY	Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
L402651	u6765	m451	HARRY	You can get the general idea...
L402650	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Can we see it from the back yard?
L402649	u6765	m451	HARRY	Is it really your camper?
L402648	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Well, you were pretty great!
L402632	u6765	m451	HARRY	Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
L402631	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
L402625	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
L402624	u6765	m451	HARRY	Shelly?
L402594	u6765	m451	HARRY	I'll second that.
L402593	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
L402584	u6765	m451	HARRY	Okay.
L402583	u6770	m451	SHELLY	How's it going chef?
L402572	u6765	m451	HARRY	Really?
L402571	u6770	m451	SHELLY	You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
L402568	u6765	m451	HARRY	I'm looking forward to that.
L402567	u6770	m451	SHELLY	It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
L402566	u6765	m451	HARRY	Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
L402565	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
L402564	u6765	m451	HARRY	I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
L402545	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Goodnight.
L402544	u6765	m451	HARRY	I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
L402541	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Goodnight.
L402540	u6765	m451	HARRY	Goodnight Shelly.
L402539	u6770	m451	SHELLY	It's only eight o'clock.
L402538	u6765	m451	HARRY	I ahh, better go.
L402536	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Good.
L402535	u6765	m451	HARRY	Yes.
L402534	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Kiss me.
L402533	u6765	m451	HARRY	Want to what?
L402532	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Do you want to?
L402531	u6765	m451	HARRY	Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
L402530	u6770	m451	SHELLY	What are you wearing?
L402529	u6765	m451	HARRY	At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
L402528	u6770	m451	SHELLY	See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
L402527	u6765	m451	HARRY	Rock?
L402526	u6770	m451	SHELLY	In ages, I know, me neither.
L402525	u6765	m451	HARRY	I haven't danced in.....
L402524	u6765	m451	HARRY	Is there enough room?
L402523	u6770	m451	SHELLY	This is where we are.
L402522	u6765	m451	HARRY	Here?
L402521	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Dance with me?
L402520	u6765	m451	HARRY	I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
L402519	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Did she ever see Vada?
L402518	u6765	m451	HARRY	Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
L402517	u6770	m451	SHELLY	What happened to her?
L402516	u6765	m451	HARRY	Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
L402515	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
L402514	u6765	m451	HARRY	No, why?
L402513	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Are you mad at me?
L402512	u6765	m451	HARRY	Yeah.
L402511	u6770	m451	SHELLY	You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
L402510	u6765	m451	HARRY	Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
L402509	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
L402508	u6765	m451	HARRY	It's nice.
L402507	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Home sweet home.
L402506	u6765	m451	HARRY	Okay, sure.
L402505	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
L402504	u6765	m451	HARRY	I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
L402503	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I had a good time tonight.
L402492	u6770	m451	SHELLY	You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
L402491	u6765	m451	HARRY	Oh, how do you mean?
L402490	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Kinda like men.
L402489	u6765	m451	HARRY	Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
L402488	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
L402484	u6765	m451	HARRY	Why d'you think these seats were empty.
L402483	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
L402482	u6765	m451	HARRY	What's that?
L402481	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I just had a terrible thought Harry.
L402471	u6765	m451	HARRY	No. Just, more activity.
L402470	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Does it make it easier to win?
L402379	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Okay.
L402378	u6765	m451	HARRY	I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
L402377	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
L402376	u6765	m451	HARRY	I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
L402375	u6770	m451	SHELLY	You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
L402374	u6765	m451	HARRY	It's no big deal.
L402373	u6770	m451	SHELLY	In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
L402372	u6765	m451	HARRY	I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
L402371	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
L402370	u6770	m451	SHELLY	No kidding?
L402369	u6765	m451	HARRY	I wrote that.
L402368	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
L402367	u6765	m451	HARRY	Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
L402366	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
L402365	u6765	m451	HARRY	Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
L402364	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Hi.
L402338	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I'm sure she will.
L402337	u6765	m451	HARRY	After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
L402336	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
L402335	u6765	m451	HARRY	Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
L402334	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
L402333	u6765	m451	HARRY	Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
L402272	u6765	m451	HARRY	She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
L402271	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Harry, I really think she.....
L402270	u6765	m451	HARRY	She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
L402269	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
L402268	u6765	m451	HARRY	Oh that, she just likes to play.
L402267	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Well the other night at dinner...
L402266	u6765	m451	HARRY	What do you mean??
L402265	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
L402264	u6765	m451	HARRY	That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
L402263	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
L402262	u6765	m451	HARRY	She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
L402261	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
L402260	u6765	m451	HARRY	This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
L402259	u6770	m451	SHELLY	You don't like it?
L402257	u6765	m451	HARRY	Yeah.
L402256	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
L402255	u6765	m451	HARRY	Uh huh?
L402147	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
L402146	u6765	m451	HARRY	Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
L402145	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
L402144	u6765	m451	HARRY	You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
L402143	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
L402142	u6765	m451	HARRY	Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
L402141	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I need the job.
L402140	u6765	m451	HARRY	Pardon?
L402139	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Excuse me, what about the job?
L402123	u6770	m451	SHELLY	The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;

L402120	u6765	m451	HARRY	Yes they are.
L402119	u6770	m451	SHELLY	They're dead?
L402118	u6765	m451	HARRY	Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
L402117	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
L402116	u6765	m451	HARRY	Uhh, Miss devoto...
L402115	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
L402114	u6765	m451	HARRY	I think it's still available.
L402113	u6770	m451	SHELLY	It's still available I hope?
L403001	u6765	m451	HARRY	That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
L403000	u6772	m451	VADA	I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
L402999	u6765	m451	HARRY	Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
L402998	u6772	m451	VADA	Do you miss her?
L402997	u6765	m451	HARRY	Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
L402996	u6772	m451	VADA	Really?
L402995	u6765	m451	HARRY	She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
L402994	u6772	m451	VADA	What was my mama like?
L402993	u6765	m451	HARRY	Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
L402992	u6772	m451	VADA	In the garage.
L402991	u6765	m451	HARRY	I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
L402990	u6772	m451	VADA	I found this.
L402988	u6765	m451	HARRY	No, no.
L402987	u6772	m451	VADA	The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
L402986	u6765	m451	HARRY	What??
L402985	u6772	m451	VADA	Did I kill my mother?
L402936	u6772	m451	VADA	Get away, get away!!
L402935	u6765	m451	HARRY	He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
L402891	u6765	m451	HARRY	There were just too many of 'em.
L402890	u6772	m451	VADA	He's okay isn't he?
L402889	u6765	m451	HARRY	He was allergic to bees.
L402888	u6772	m451	VADA	Why not?
L402887	u6765	m451	HARRY	No sweetheart, you can't.
L402886	u6772	m451	VADA	Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
L402885	u6772	m451	VADA	I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
L402884	u6765	m451	HARRY	Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
L402883	u6765	m451	HARRY	He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
L402882	u6772	m451	VADA	Yes.

L402238	u6772	m451	VADA	Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
L402237	u6765	m451	HARRY	Any more soda left?
L402236	u6772	m451	VADA	It's for school, for summer writing class.
L402235	u6765	m451	HARRY	That's a lot of money for a little girl.

L402086	u6772	m451	VADA	Ahem.
L402056	u6765	m451	HARRY	O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
L402055	u6772	m451	VADA	I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
L402582	u6765	m451	HARRY	Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!

L402902	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Hi.
L403020	u6772	m451	VADA	Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
L403019	u6767	m451	MR. BIXLER	We'd love to hear it.
L403018	u6772	m451	VADA	I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.

L402686	u6768	m451	NURSE RANDALL	You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
L402685	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
L402684	u6768	m451	NURSE RANDALL	Why do you think she says that?
L402683	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	No.
L402682	u6768	m451	NURSE RANDALL	Do you think she is?
L402681	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Cause she's dying.

L402667	u6769	m451	PHIL	Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
L402666	u6772	m451	VADA	My Dad was funny?
L402665	u6769	m451	PHIL	Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
L402664	u6772	m451	VADA	Really?
L402663	u6769	m451	PHIL	After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
L402662	u6772	m451	VADA	Why?
L402661	u6769	m451	PHIL	Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.

L402978	u6772	m451	VADA	I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
L402977	u6770	m451	SHELLY	It's okay sweetheart.
L402818	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
L402817	u6772	m451	VADA	I think it should be outlawed.
L402816	u6770	m451	SHELLY	It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
L402815	u6772	m451	VADA	My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
L402814	u6770	m451	SHELLY	It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.

L402810	u6772	m451	VADA	I don't want, I don't need your help....
L402809	u6770	m451	SHELLY	What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
L402808	u6772	m451	VADA	I'm hemorrhaging.
L402807	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Well he just left, what's wrong?
L402806	u6772	m451	VADA	Where's Daddy?
L402805	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
L402804	u6772	m451	VADA	Daddy??!?!?!
L402751	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Yes!!
L402750	u6772	m451	VADA	NO!
L402743	u6772	m451	VADA	NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
L402742	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
L402732	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Oh great!!
L402731	u6772	m451	VADA	I won, I won!!!
L402724	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
L402723	u6772	m451	VADA	Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
L402722	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
L402619	u6772	m451	VADA	Are you here to take Shelly back?
L402618	u6770	m451	SHELLY	This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
L402617	u6772	m451	VADA	I like my name.
L402597	u6772	m451	VADA	See food!
L402596	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Uh huh, why?
L402595	u6772	m451	VADA	Hey Shelly, like seafood?
L402563	u6772	m451	VADA	Hi.
L402562	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
L402480	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Aarrggh.
L402479	u6772	m451	VADA	Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
L402397	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
L402396	u6772	m451	VADA	Do you like putting makeup on people?
L402395	u6770	m451	SHELLY	They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
L402394	u6772	m451	VADA	The boys at school don't think I am.
L402393	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
L402392	u6772	m451	VADA	Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
L402389	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Come here, sit down.
L402388	u6772	m451	VADA	No.
L402387	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Have you ever tried any?
L402386	u6772	m451	VADA	I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
L402385	u6770	m451	SHELLY	A girl's always gotta look her best.
L402384	u6772	m451	VADA	So how come you're putting lipstick on?
L402383	u6770	m451	SHELLY	No.
L402382	u6772	m451	VADA	Are you going out somewhere?
L402310	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Okay.
L402309	u6772	m451	VADA	You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
L402308	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Sure.
L402307	u6772	m451	VADA	Can I use your bathroom first?
L402306	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
L402298	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
L402297	u6772	m451	VADA	Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
L402296	u6770	m451	SHELLY	No, I'm divorced.
L402295	u6772	m451	VADA	Are you married?
L402292	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Mostly love, and romance.
L402291	u6772	m451	VADA	What are they about?
L402290	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Uh huh.
L402289	u6772	m451	VADA	Did you read ALL these books?
L402285	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Thomas?
L402284	u6772	m451	VADA	I would.
L402283	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
L402282	u6772	m451	VADA	Big Ringo fan.
L402277	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
L402276	u6772	m451	VADA	Can we look around in your camper?
L402275	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Hi.
L402252	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Come on sweetie.
L402251	u6772	m451	VADA	My ball, I lost my ball.
L402250	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Vada? VADA?? What happened??
L402232	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Well you don't know that. Ask him.
L402231	u6772	m451	VADA	He won't give it to me.
L402230	u6770	m451	SHELLY	I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
L402229	u6772	m451	VADA	Shut your big fat mouth!
L402225	u6772	m451	VADA	I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
L402224	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Maybe black means you're happy?
L402221	u6772	m451	VADA	It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
L402220	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
L402219	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Chocolate?
L402218	u6772	m451	VADA	He's allergic to everything.
L402213	u6772	m451	VADA	I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
L402212	u6770	m451	SHELLY	You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
L402202	u6772	m451	VADA	I am.
L402201	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Who's winning?
L402130	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Oh.
L402129	u6772	m451	VADA	She's shy.
L402127	u6772	m451	VADA	That's really cool.
L402126	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Yes it is.
L402125	u6772	m451	VADA	Is that your camper?
L402478	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
L402477	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Oh great!
L402304	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
L402303	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	What are you saving for?
L402302	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
L402294	u6770	m451	SHELLY	They're just fun to read.
L402293	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Eeeeuuuww, gross.
L402281	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Liverpool?
L402280	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
L402279	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Uh huh.
L402278	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
L402217	u6770	m451	SHELLY	To chocolate?
L402216	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I'm allergic to it.
L402215	u6770	m451	SHELLY	Thomas J?
L402871	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
L402870	u6772	m451	VADA	For what?
L402869	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Would you think of me?
L402868	u6772	m451	VADA	What?
L402867	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Okay, seeya.  Vada?
L402866	u6772	m451	VADA	Seeya tomorrow.
L402865	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Okay.
L402864	u6772	m451	VADA	Well, let's spit on it.
L402863	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	You better not either.
L402859	u6772	m451	VADA	Just, hurry.
L402858	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Umm, Ummmmm
L402857	u6772	m451	VADA	Say something it's too quiet.
L402852	u6772	m451	VADA	Okay on the count of three.
L402851	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Okay, okay.
L402850	u6772	m451	VADA	Just do it.
L402849	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	But then I won't be able to see anything.
L402848	u6772	m451	VADA	Close your eyes.
L402847	u6772	m451	VADA	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
L402846	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Like this?
L402845	u6772	m451	VADA	Here, practice on your arm like this.
L402844	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	But, I don't know how.
L402843	u6772	m451	VADA	Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
L402842	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	No.
L402841	u6772	m451	VADA	Uh huh.
L402840	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Like they do on TV?
L402839	u6772	m451	VADA	Have you ever kissed anyone?
L402838	u6772	m451	VADA	Not true.
L402837	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
L402836	u6772	m451	VADA	It is not.
L402835	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
L402834	u6772	m451	VADA	I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
L402833	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Well when you get older, you just have to.
L402822	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
L402821	u6772	m451	VADA	I dunno..
L402820	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Hi Vada, can you come out?
L402819	u6772	m451	VADA	Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
L402798	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Okay, seeya.
L402797	u6772	m451	VADA	No, I'm hiding out.
L402796	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	You can come to my house for dinner?
L402795	u6772	m451	VADA	Leave then, some friend you are.
L402794	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
L402793	u6772	m451	VADA	Then go home, baby.
L402792	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
L402791	u6772	m451	VADA	He likes her better than me.
L402790	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I do, she's real funny.
L402789	u6772	m451	VADA	I don't like her.
L402788	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	So now you'll have a mother.
L402787	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	They're getting married?
L402786	u6772	m451	VADA	You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
L402785	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Wow, was it a decoder ring?
L402784	u6772	m451	VADA	My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
L402783	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Why are you running away?
L402782	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
L402781	u6772	m451	VADA	Get up!?
L402778	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Really?
L402777	u6772	m451	VADA	No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
L402776	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I wanna live with them too.
L402775	u6772	m451	VADA	California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
L402770	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Bye Ma.

L402768	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Come on, let's go.
L402762	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Sure.
L402761	u6772	m451	VADA	Hi, wanna ride bikes?
L402760	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Hi Vada.
L402712	u6772	m451	VADA	Do it!
L402711	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	But I have my clothes on!

L402703	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	For their meat.
L402702	u6772	m451	VADA	What do you want it for anyway?
L402701	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	You're right, let's knock it down.
L402700	u6772	m451	VADA	Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
L402699	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Stand back.
L402698	u6772	m451	VADA	So?
L402697	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Pointing There's a beehive right there!
L402696	u6772	m451	VADA	What?
L402695	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Woah!!
L402693	u6772	m451	VADA	HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
L402692	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	THIS!! 
L402691	u6772	m451	VADA	What?
L402690	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Hey Vada, guess what we got?
L402487	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
L402486	u6772	m451	VADA	Go???
L402485	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Can we go yet?
L402476	u6772	m451	VADA	Duck!
L402475	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
L402474	u6772	m451	VADA	We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
L402473	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
L402467	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I stopped that!
L402466	u6772	m451	VADA	Bed wetter!
L402465	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I am not.
L402464	u6772	m451	VADA	Pacifist!
L402463	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I told you i'll get in trouble.
L402462	u6772	m451	VADA	Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
L402461	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
L402460	u6772	m451	VADA	Sorry.
L402459	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Don't DO that!!
L402458	u6772	m451	VADA	Here.
L402429	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
L402428	u6772	m451	VADA	It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
L402427	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
L402426	u6772	m451	VADA	I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
L402425	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Heaven.
L402424	u6772	m451	VADA	What?
L402423	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	What do you think it's like?
L402422	u6772	m451	VADA	No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
L402421	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Do you remember her?
L402420	u6772	m451	VADA	It's my mother.
L402419	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Who's that with your Dad?
L402418	u6772	m451	VADA	Yes.
L402417	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Is that your Dad?
L402416	u6772	m451	VADA	Never mind.
L402415	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Hey, where does it say that?
L402414	u6772	m451	VADA	You have no personality.
L402413	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	What?
L402412	u6772	m451	VADA	Hmmmm, interesting.
L402411	u6772	m451	VADA	Come on, it's fun.
L402410	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	No, I don't wanna.
L402409	u6772	m451	VADA	That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
L402408	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Hey look at this!
L402405	u6772	m451	VADA	Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
L402404	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Where's your bike?
L402403	u6772	m451	VADA	A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
L402402	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	What's wrong with your eyes?
L402401	u6772	m451	VADA	No.
L402400	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Your lip bleeding?
L402360	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Okay, OW!
L402359	u6772	m451	VADA	Uh huh.
L402358	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	If I do it, can we go?
L402357	u6772	m451	VADA	It'll bleed.
L402356	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	It's a mosquito bite.
L402355	u6772	m451	VADA	You could pick that scab on your arm.
L402354	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Naah, I don't wanna.
L402353	u6772	m451	VADA	Hey, we can become blood brothers.
L402352	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
L402348	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
L402347	u6772	m451	VADA	Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
L402346	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I'm trying.
L402345	u6772	m451	VADA	Hurry!
L402344	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	Oh no!  UUH.
L402343	u6772	m451	VADA	Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
L402342	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
L402341	u6772	m451	VADA	Maybe they had a big breakfast.
L402228	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
L402227	u6772	m451	VADA	It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
L402226	u6771	m451	THOMAS J	She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
L402223	u6772	m451	VADA	It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.

L415045	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	He's conducting experiments of his own.
L415044	u6872	m459	SALLY	When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.

L415042	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Uh-huh.
L414994	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--

L414992	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
L414990	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
L414989	u6872	m459	SALLY	But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
L414987	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
L414986	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
L414985	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Why not?

L414932	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Just what?
L414931	u6872	m459	SALLY	That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...

L414925	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
L414924	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.

L451721	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	You don't believe me?
L451719	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	So it's to be torture.
L451718	u7143	m480	ALBINO	The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
L451717	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then why bother curing me?
L451716	u7143	m480	ALBINO	Till they kill you. Yeah.
L451715	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then I'm here till I die?
L451714	u7143	m480	ALBINO	Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
L451993	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
L451992	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I killed him myself.
L451969	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I do not marry tonight.
L451968	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Brides often are, I'm told.
L451967	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Should I be?
L451966	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
L451824	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
L451823	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
L451822	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
L451821	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	You're a silly girl.
L451820	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
L451818	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
L451817	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Every ship but the four you sent.
L451816	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
L451815	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
L451770	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Of course.
L451769	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	He will come for me.
L451749	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
L451748	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	My Westley will always come for me.
L451703	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I swear it will be done.
L451702	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"He is a sailor on the pirate ship ""Revenge."" Promise to return him to his ship."
L451701	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
L451700	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
L451645	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
L451644	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	... as ... you ... wish...
L451642	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
L451641	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
L451640	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	And what am I?
L451639	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	"I asked him what was so important for him. ""True love,"" he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are."
L451638	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	"He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, ""Please. Please, I need to live."" It was the ""please"" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53."
L451637	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Nothing you can say will upset me.
L451636	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Does it bother you to hear?
L451635	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
L451634	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You mock my pain!
L451633	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
L451632	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
L451628	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
L451627	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
L451626	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	With pride. What can I do for you?
L451625	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
L451624	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
L451623	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Rest, Highness.
L451619	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
L451618	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Are not capable of love is what you mean.
L451617	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	He knows I do not love him.
L451616	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
L451615	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
L451614	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
L451613	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
L451612	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
L451611	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
L451610	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Catch your breath.
L451607	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
L451606	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
L451605	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
L451604	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Who are you?
L452050	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
L452049	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
L452048	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"Did you say, ""I do""?"
L452047	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"But it did. I was there. This old man said, ""Man and wife."""
L452046	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
L452045	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	What?
L452044	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It never happened.
L452043	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
L452042	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	What hideous sin have you committed lately?
L452041	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
L452023	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Gently!!
L452022	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"At a time like this that's all you can think to say? ""Gently?"""
L452021	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Gently.
L452020	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
L451687	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
L451686	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We did it.
L451683	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
L451682	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
L451681	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
L451680	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	No. No. We have already succeeded.
L451679	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
L451674	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	What? -- go on --
L451673	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, ""All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" Three years he said that. ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened."
L451671	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
L451670	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
L451669	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship ""Revenge"" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts."
L451667	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
L451666	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Singed a bit, were you?
L451663	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
L451662	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We'll never survive.
L451654	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	There will never be a need.
L451653	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I will never doubt again.
L451652	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
L451651	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Well ... you were dead.
L451650	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"I told you, ""I would always come for you."" Why didn't you wait for me?"
L451649	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
L451648	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Can you move at all?
L451358	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	This is true love. You think this happens every day?
L451357	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But how can you be sure?
L451356	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Hear this now: I will come for you.
L451355	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But what if something happens to you?
L451354	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Of course you will.
L451353	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I fear I'll never see you again.
L451339	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	As you wish.
L451338	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
L451336	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	As you wish.
L451335	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
L451549	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
L451548	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Why should that make such a difference?
L451546	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
L451545	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Why is that, do you think?
L451542	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
L451541	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And a good thing too.
L451540	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You're quick.
L451539	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
L451538	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
L451537	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
L451536	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
L451535	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I could kill you now.
L451534	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
L451533	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
L451532	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I believe you -- So what happens now?
L451531	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
L451527	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
L451526	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Finish him, finish him. Your way.
L451525	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	What do I do?
L451524	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
L451457	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'm waiting!
L451456	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
L451445	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
L451444	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
L451443	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
L451442	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
L451441	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I thought I was going faster.
L451440	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Faster!
L451413	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Veer left. Left. Left!
L451412	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I only dog paddle.
L451397	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Anybody want a peanut?
L451396	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	No more rhymes now, I mean it.
L451382	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	"Am I going mad or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass."
L451381	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
L451380	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
L451379	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You never said anything about killing anyone.
L451378	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
L451377	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
L451376	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Who's Guilder?
L451375	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
L452009	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I'll be right back.
L452008	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
L451965	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I hope we win...
L451964	u7148	m480	INIGO	What?
L451963	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Inigo.
L451962	u7148	m480	INIGO	Right, right, sorry.
L451961	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
L451955	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
L451954	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where did you get that?
L451953	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Will this do?
L451950	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Over the Albino, I think.
L451949	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
L451934	u7148	m480	INIGO	We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
L451933	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You've been mostly dead all day.
L451928	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
L451927	u7148	m480	INIGO	Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
L451926	u7148	m480	INIGO	We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
L451925	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Has it been fifteen minutes?
L451924	u7148	m480	INIGO	What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
L451923	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
L451861	u7148	m480	INIGO	I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
L451860	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I have a little.
L451859	u7148	m480	INIGO	Have you any money?
L451858	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	The body?
L451857	u7148	m480	INIGO	Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
L451835	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Everybody ... MOVE!!
L451834	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- Fezzik, please --
L451832	u7148	m480	INIGO	His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
L451831	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	The Man in Black?
L451808	u7148	m480	INIGO	Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
L451807	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	But you don't know where he is.
L451806	u7148	m480	INIGO	To find the Man in Black, obviously.
L451805	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	-- where?
L451804	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
L451803	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	-- what? --
L451802	u7148	m480	INIGO	No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
L451800	u7148	m480	INIGO	That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
L451799	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I don't think more than ten.
L451798	u7148	m480	INIGO	How many could you handle?
L451797	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
L451793	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Yeah?
L451792	u7148	m480	INIGO	Perhaps not. I feel fine.
L451791	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
L451790	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	True!
L451789	u7148	m480	INIGO	It's you.
L451788	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Hello.
L451395	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	If there are, we'll all be dead.
L451394	u7148	m480	INIGO	FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
L451392	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Yes, some of the time. 
L451391	u7148	m480	INIGO	Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
L451390	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	He's really very short on charm.
L451389	u7148	m480	INIGO	Probably he means no harm.
L452098	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	As you wish...
L452097	u7153	m480	THE KID	Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
L452095	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
L452094	u7153	m480	THE KID	Okay.
L452093	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
L452090	u7153	m480	THE KID	I don't mind so much.
L452089	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
L452088	u7153	m480	THE KID	What? What?
L451856	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
L451855	u7153	m480	THE KID	No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
L451852	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
L451851	u7153	m480	THE KID	Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
L451850	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	I don't understand.
L451849	u7153	m480	THE KID	Who gets Humperdinck?
L451848	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	You want me to read this or not?
L451847	u7153	m480	THE KID	Westley's only faking, right?
L451743	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
L451742	u7153	m480	THE KID	See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
L451741	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
L451734	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
L451733	u7153	m480	THE KID	Yes.
L451732	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Do you want me to go on with this?
L451731	u7153	m480	THE KID	I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
L451730	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
L451729	u7153	m480	THE KID	You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
L451660	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
L451659	u7153	m480	THE KID	Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
L451658	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Someday, you may not mind so much.
L451657	u7153	m480	THE KID	They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
L451656	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
L451655	u7153	m480	THE KID	Oh no. No, please.
L451422	u7153	m480	THE KID	No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
L451421	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Because I can stop now if you want.
L451420	u7153	m480	THE KID	Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
L451419	u7153	m480	THE KID	Well, I wasn't nervous.
L451418	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
L451417	u7153	m480	THE KID	What?
L451360	u7153	m480	THE KID	-- murdered by pirates is good --
L451359	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
L451352	u7153	m480	THE KID	I don't be-leeve this.
L451351	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
L451349	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
L451348	u7153	m480	THE KID	-- well, when does it get good?
L451347	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	-- wait, just wait --
L451346	u7153	m480	THE KID	What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
L451345	u7153	m480	THE KID	-hold it, hold it-
L451333	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
L451332	u7153	m480	THE KID	Yeah. It's really good.
L451331	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
L451330	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
L451329	u7153	m480	THE KID	It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
L451327	u7153	m480	THE KID	Has it got any sports in it?
L451326	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
L451325	u7153	m480	THE KID	A book?
L451324	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Open it up.
L451323	u7153	m480	THE KID	What is it?
L451322	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	I brought you a special present.
L451814	u7157	m480	YELLIN	The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
L451813	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Double it. My Princess must be safe.
L451812	u7157	m480	YELLIN	The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
L451811	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Rise and report.
L451775	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Try ruling the world sometime.
L451774	u7157	m480	YELLIN	It won't be easy, Sire.
L451773	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
L451772	u7157	m480	YELLIN	Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
L451771	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
L451766	u7157	m480	YELLIN	My spy network has heard no such news.
L451765	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
L451764	u7157	m480	YELLIN	Sire.
L451763	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Yellin.
L452061	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
L452060	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
L452059	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
L452058	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
L452055	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
L452054	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
L452053	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
L452052	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	No.  To the pain.
L452051	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
L451696	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	DEATH FIRST!!
L451695	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	For the last time -- SURRENDER!
L451693	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It will not happen!
L451692	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I tell you once again -- surrender!
L451691	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
L451690	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
L451689	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
L451754	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
L451753	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
L451752	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
L451751	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
L451747	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
L451746	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Yes.
L451745	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
L451724	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Of course.
L451723	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
L451705	u7152	m480	RUGEN	I swear it will be done.
L451704	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
L451557	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
L451556	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Could this be a trap?
L451555	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
L451554	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Shall we track them both?
L451553	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
L451552	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Who won? How did it end?
L451551	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
L452086	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
L452085	u7148	m480	INIGO	You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
L452073	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	In that case --
L452072	u7148	m480	INIGO	No.
L452071	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I thought he was with you.
L452070	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where's Fezzik?
L451981	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Light him.
L451980	u7148	m480	INIGO	Now?
L451978	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Not yet.
L451977	u7148	m480	INIGO	Now?
L451960	u7148	m480	INIGO	I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
L451959	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
L451958	u7148	m480	INIGO	Why? You can't even lift one.
L451952	u7148	m480	INIGO	There we cannot help you.
L451951	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
L451944	u7148	m480	INIGO	Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
L451943	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	And our assets?
L451942	u7148	m480	INIGO	And it is guarded by sixty men.
L451938	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
L451937	u7148	m480	INIGO	Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
L451936	u7148	m480	INIGO	Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
L451935	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
L451930	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
L451929	u7148	m480	INIGO	Your guess is as good as mine --
L452039	u7148	m480	INIGO	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
L452038	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- anything you want --
L452037	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- offer me everything I ask for --
L452036	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- all that I have and more please --
L452035	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- power too -- promise me that --
L452034	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- yes --
L452033	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- offer me money --
L452032	u7152	m480	RUGEN	No --
L452030	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Stop saying that!
L452029	u7148	m480	INIGO	Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
L451917	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
L451916	u7148	m480	INIGO	Thank you for everything.
L451910	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
L451909	u7148	m480	INIGO	Humiliations galore!
L451892	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	"Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said ""to blave."" And, as we all know, ""to blave"" means ""to bluff."" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated"
L451891	u7148	m480	INIGO	True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
L451887	u7148	m480	INIGO	What's that?
L451886	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
L451885	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
L451884	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's dead. He can't talk.
L451883	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
L451882	u7148	m480	INIGO	I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
L451881	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Are you a rotten liar.
L451880	u7148	m480	INIGO	This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
L451879	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
L451878	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sixty-five.
L451877	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
L451876	u7148	m480	INIGO	We're really in a terrible rush.
L451875	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Hah?
L451874	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sir. Sir.
L451872	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
L451871	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's already dead.
L451870	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
L451865	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
L451864	u7148	m480	INIGO	Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
L451863	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	What? What?
L451521	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
L451520	u7148	m480	INIGO	Kill me quickly.
L451518	u7148	m480	INIGO	Okay.
L451517	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Get used to disappointment.
L451516	u7148	m480	INIGO	I must know.
L451515	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	No one of consequence.
L451514	u7148	m480	INIGO	Who are you?!
L451513	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I am not left-handed either.
L451512	u7148	m480	INIGO	Tell me.
L451511	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	There's something I ought to tell you.
L451510	u7148	m480	INIGO	I ought to be after twenty years.
L451509	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're amazing!
L451507	u7148	m480	INIGO	I am not left-handed.
L451506	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And what is that?
L451505	u7148	m480	INIGO	Because I know something you don't know.
L451504	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Then why are you smiling?
L451503	u7148	m480	INIGO	I admit it -- you are better than I am.
L451502	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
L451501	u7148	m480	INIGO	You are wonderful!
L451497	u7148	m480	INIGO	Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
L451496	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
L451494	u7148	m480	INIGO	Begin!
L451493	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
L451492	u7148	m480	INIGO	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
L451491	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
L451490	u7148	m480	INIGO	You are ready, then?
L451489	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
L451488	u7148	m480	INIGO	More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
L451487	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You've done nothing but study swordplay?
L451486	u7148	m480	INIGO	"I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."""
L451485	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	How old were you?
L451481	u7148	m480	INIGO	My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
L451480	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Do you always begin conversations this way?
L451478	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Again. Thank you.
L451477	u7148	m480	INIGO	We'll wait until you're ready.
L451473	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Nothing comes to mind.
L451472	u7148	m480	INIGO	You don't know any way you'll trust me?
L451471	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
L451470	u7148	m480	INIGO	I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
L451469	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
L451468	u7148	m480	INIGO	But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
L451467	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	That does put a damper on our relationship.
L451466	u7148	m480	INIGO	I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
L451465	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
L451464	u7148	m480	INIGO	I do not suppose you could speed things up?
L451463	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Thank you.
L451462	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sorry.
L451461	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
L451460	u7148	m480	INIGO	Slow going?
L451455	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Oh, have it your way.
L451454	u7148	m480	INIGO	Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
L451453	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You know what a hurry we're in.
L451452	u7148	m480	INIGO	I want to duel him left-handed.
L451450	u7148	m480	INIGO	You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
L451449	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
L451438	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Inconceivable!
L451437	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
L451435	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
L451434	u7148	m480	INIGO	Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
L451411	u7148	m480	INIGO	I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
L451410	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Go in, get after her!
L451408	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	What?
L451407	u7148	m480	INIGO	No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
L451406	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
L451405	u7148	m480	INIGO	You're sure nobody's following us?
L451404	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
L451401	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	That would be inconceivable.
L451400	u7148	m480	INIGO	Making sure nobody's following us.
L451601	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
L451600	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You guessed wrong.
L451599	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
L451598	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	What's so funny?
L451593	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I will. And I choose --
L451592	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Then make your choice.
L451591	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
L451590	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
L451589	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
L451588	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're just stalling now.
L451587	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
L451586	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Australia.
L451585	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Wait till I get going! Where was I?
L451584	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
L451583	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
L451582	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You've made your decision then7
L451581	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
L451578	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Hmm.
L451577	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
L451576	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I smell nothing.
L451575	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Inhale this, but do not touch.
L451574	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Good. Then pour the wine.
L451573	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I accept.
L451571	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	For the Princess?
L451570	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
L451569	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Morons.
L451568	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Yes.
L451567	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
L451566	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're that smart?
L451565	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
L451564	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
L451563	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
L451562	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
L451561	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
L451560	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Let me explain-
L451922	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Bye.
L451921	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	It would take a miracle. Bye!
L451920	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Think it'll work?
L451919	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Have fun storming the castle.
L451918	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Bye-bye, boys.
L451915	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	A good hour. Yeah.
L451914	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Yeah, an hour.
L451913	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	An hour.
L451912	u7154	m480	VALERIE	The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
L451905	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
L451904	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Nobody's hearing nothing!
L451903	u7154	m480	VALERIE	A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
L451902	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	I'm not listening.
L451901	u7154	m480	VALERIE	What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
L451900	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
L451899	u7154	m480	VALERIE	He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
L451898	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Don't say another word, Valerie.
L451897	u7154	m480	VALERIE	"True love. He said, ""true love,"" Max. My God --"
L451896	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
L451895	u7154	m480	VALERIE	I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
L451894	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	-- get back, witch --
L451319	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Maybe he won't.
L451318	u7153	m480	THE KID	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
L451317	u7151	m480	MOTHER	You are sick, that's why he's here.
L451316	u7153	m480	THE KID	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
L451315	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Your grandfather's here.
L451314	u7153	m480	THE KID	What?
L451313	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Guess what.
L451312	u7153	m480	THE KID	A little bit.
L451311	u7151	m480	MOTHER	You feeling any better?
L470995	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	So what's your next move, Valiant?
L470994	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Well, I'll be...
L470993	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
L470981	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
L470980	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Oh, a ladies man, huh?
L470973	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah...
L470972	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You serve martinis, doncha?
L470971	u7288	m492	DOLORES	We don't serve formula. Snookums.
L470992	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
L470991	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
L470988	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
L470987	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it then?
L470986	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
L470983	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
L470982	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
L470978	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
L470977	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
L470976	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
L470975	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
L470974	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
L470863	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
L470862	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
L470861	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
L470860	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Shoulda guessed.
L470859	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
L470858	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
L470857	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
L470856	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
L470855	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
L470788	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
L470787	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
L470786	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
L470785	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
L470783	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
L470782	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A tweeting bird?
L470781	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	What's this, Roger?
L471319	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
L471318	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
L471317	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
L471316	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
L471315	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
L471314	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'll bet.
L471313	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
L471208	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, no...
L471207	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Sounds like singin'.
L471206	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's that comin' from the bar?
L471205	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
L471204	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
L471203	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
L471202	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon, right?
L471201	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
L471200	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
L471199	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
L471198	u7295	m492	VALIANT	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
L471197	u7288	m492	DOLORES	What was <u>that</u>?
L471083	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
L471082	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
L471079	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
L471078	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
L471073	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
L471072	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So what's the scam, Eddie?
L471066	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
L471065	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
L471057	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
L471056	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you decided to help him after all?
L471055	u7288	m492	DOLORES	It's all yours.
L471054	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
L471053	u7288	m492	DOLORES	He's a riot.
L471048	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
L471047	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
L470998	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's a Toon... who cares?
L470997	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
L470990	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
L470989	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
L470985	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L470984	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
L470969	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
L470968	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Do you think the rabbit did it?
L470962	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Bastards put him on notice.
L470961	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
L470960	u7288	m492	DOLORES	A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
L470957	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
L470956	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
L470835	u7288	m492	DOLORES	R.K. Maroon.
L470834	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Check the scrawl.
L470833	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Is this paper even good?
L470832	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
L470831	u7288	m492	DOLORES	This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
L470830	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
L470829	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
L471487	u7289	m492	DOOM	That's right, me.
L471486	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You?
L471483	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
L471482	u7289	m492	DOOM	Surprised?
L471481	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
L471447	u7289	m492	DOOM	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
L471446	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
L471445	u7289	m492	DOOM	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
L471444	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell's a freeway?
L471443	u7289	m492	DOOM	Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
L471441	u7289	m492	DOOM	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
L471440	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
L471427	u7289	m492	DOOM	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
L471426	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
L471425	u7289	m492	DOOM	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
L471424	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So you're Cloverleaf?
L471423	u7289	m492	DOOM	No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
L471411	u7289	m492	DOOM	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
L471410	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
L471409	u7289	m492	DOOM	These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
L471258	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
L471257	u7289	m492	DOOM	Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
L471253	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
L471252	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
L471145	u7289	m492	DOOM	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
L471144	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
L471143	u7289	m492	DOOM	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
L471142	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
L471141	u7289	m492	DOOM	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
L471140	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
L471139	u7289	m492	DOOM	Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
L471138	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
L471137	u7289	m492	DOOM	They?
L471136	u7295	m492	VALIANT	They must've taken it off me.
L471132	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
L471131	u7289	m492	DOOM	Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
L471128	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Ask her...
L471127	u7289	m492	DOOM	Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
L470933	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
L470932	u7289	m492	DOOM	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
L470931	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
L470930	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
L470929	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
L470925	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
L470924	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
L470923	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
L471160	u7290	m492	EARL	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
L471159	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
L471158	u7290	m492	EARL	Does it hurt?
L471157	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No...
L471156	u7290	m492	EARL	You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
L471155	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What am I, Earl?
L471154	u7290	m492	EARL	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
L471153	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Toon cops worked me over.
L471152	u7290	m492	EARL	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
L471151	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
L471150	u7290	m492	EARL	Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
L471406	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Eddie, come on.
L471405	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hold on a second.
L471397	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	He made me laugh.
L471396	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
L471395	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
L471394	u7295	m492	VALIANT	A joker to the end.
L471393	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
L471392	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it?
L471391	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
L471390	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How did you get onto Doom?
L471387	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's right here in the...
L471386	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Where is he?
L471385	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
L471384	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I didn't know who I could trust.
L471383	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why didn't you tell me?
L471382	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
L471379	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
L471378	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
L471377	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
L471376	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You shot Roger.
L471187	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
L471186	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
L471185	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
L471184	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So altruistic.
L471182	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
L471181	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
L471180	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
L471179	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
L471178	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
L471177	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	No, no, no... I love my husband.
L471176	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
L471175	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
L471174	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
L471173	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Toons aren't given imperfections.
L471172	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
L471170	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
L471169	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
L471168	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's because I don't have a doorbell.
L471167	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
L471130	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
L471129	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
L471493	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
L471492	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Doom.
L471491	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	What the hell is that?
L470951	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
L470950	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's with the dip?
L470940	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
L470939	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
L470910	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Wait here...
L470909	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What a gasser.
L470908	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
L470906	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
L470905	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Now what?
L470903	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what you woke me up for?
L470902	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
L471349	u7293	m492	MAROON	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
L471348	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Take it easy.
L471347	u7293	m492	MAROON	You tricked me, damn you!
L471346	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, I don't.
L471345	u7293	m492	MAROON	You got the will in there, don't ya?
L471343	u7293	m492	MAROON	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
L471342	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
L471341	u7293	m492	MAROON	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
L471340	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
L471339	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That was the idea.
L471338	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant!  You surprised me.
L471324	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stop what?
L471323	u7293	m492	MAROON	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
L471322	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe.  Why?
L471321	u7293	m492	MAROON	Have you got the will?
L471320	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
L471099	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
L471098	u7293	m492	MAROON	I've already seen your photographs.
L471097	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
L471096	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
L471095	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
L470894	u7293	m492	MAROON	Sure, Valiant, sure...
L470893	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
L470888	u7293	m492	MAROON	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
L470887	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
L470820	u7295	m492	VALIANT	As soon as is humanly possible.
L470819	u7293	m492	MAROON	When will I hear from you?
L470818	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aren't you the lucky one...
L470817	u7293	m492	MAROON	I got him on loan from Disney.
L470813	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So's the job.
L470812	u7293	m492	MAROON	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
L470811	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
L470810	u7293	m492	MAROON	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
L470809	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't work in Toontown.
L470808	u7293	m492	MAROON	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
L470807	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So what do you want me to do?
L470806	u7293	m492	MAROON	"Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up."
L470805	u7293	m492	MAROON	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
L470804	u7295	m492	VALIANT	One too many safes dropped on his head?
L470803	u7293	m492	MAROON	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
L470802	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
L470801	u7293	m492	MAROON	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
L470795	u7293	m492	MAROON	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
L470794	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
L470793	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
L471518	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	From this box here...
L471517	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
L471516	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only time will tell.
L471515	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
L471514	u7295	m492	VALIANT	By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
L471512	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
L471511	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, kid, you're a real hero.
L471508	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
L471507	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Keep reading...
L471505	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Good idea.
L471504	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you oughta read it to her.
L471503	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471502	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
L471498	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah...
L471497	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
L471496	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
L471456	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
L471455	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
L471369	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
L471368	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin' in there?
L471335	u7295	m492	VALIANT	... I'd head for Cucamonga.
L471334	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471333	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I don't make it back here by ten...
L471332	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I rest my case.
L471331	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Two bits.
L471330	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
L471329	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
L471328	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Forget it.
L471327	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
L471326	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
L471325	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
L471311	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, it's not.
L471310	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Wrong number?
L471309	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Get away from there.
L471308	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I'll get it.
L471307	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
L471306	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Safe?
L471305	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
L471304	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
L471303	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
L471302	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A Toon?  Noooo.
L471301	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
L471300	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
L471299	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
L471296	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What is this, Twenty Questions?
L471295	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
L471294	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Me.
L471293	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Say, who's this guy laughin'?
L471291	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We can't do anything till it's dark.
L471290	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
L471289	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My brother.  Get inside.
L471288	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
L471264	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
L471263	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
L471261	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
L471260	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
L471259	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
L471256	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
L471255	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
L471254	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
L471225	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
L471224	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
L471223	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
L471222	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
L471221	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
L471220	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
L471219	u7295	m492	VALIANT	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
L471218	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
L471217	u7295	m492	VALIANT	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
L471216	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
L471215	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
L471214	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, don't I get an encore?
L471081	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
L471080	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
L471077	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
L471076	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	How do you know that?
L471075	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
L471074	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	The habeus corpus is thickening.
L471071	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
L471070	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
L471069	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
L471064	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
L471063	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
L471062	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
L471061	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
L471060	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
L471059	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, that's better.
L471058	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Does this help?
L471039	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't ever forget that.
L471038	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
L471037	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
L471034	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
L471033	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
L471019	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
L471018	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
L471017	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
L471016	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
L471008	u7295	m492	VALIANT	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
L471007	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
L471006	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
L471005	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
L471004	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
L471003	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
L471002	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin'?
L471001	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Aah!
L471000	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aah!
L470897	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Divorce?  Never!
L470896	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
L470882	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
L470881	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Pattycake!  Pattycake!
L559283	u8015	m543	CLARK	Lacy. . . I . . .
L559282	u8018	m543	LACY	Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
L559281	u8015	m543	CLARK	You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
L559280	u8018	m543	LACY	You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
L559279	u8015	m543	CLARK	Like me?
L559278	u8018	m543	LACY	Any more like you back home, Clark?
L559277	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not so sure you do.
L559276	u8018	m543	LACY	You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
L559275	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm sorry to see you go.
L559274	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
L559110	u8018	m543	LACY	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
L559109	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I'm really sorry.
L559107	u8018	m543	LACY	Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
L559106	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
L559096	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. . . !
L559095	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . my . . .
L559093	u8015	m543	CLARK	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
L559092	u8018	m543	LACY	I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
L559076	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
L559075	u8018	m543	LACY	Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
L559066	u8018	m543	LACY	. . . Let me get my purse.
L559065	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
L559024	u8018	m543	LACY	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
L559023	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I don't think . . .
L559022	u8018	m543	LACY	I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
L559021	u8015	m543	CLARK	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
L559020	u8018	m543	LACY	Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
L559019	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
L559018	u8018	m543	LACY	He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
L559011	u8015	m543	CLARK	If you say so. Here goes.
L559010	u8018	m543	LACY	Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
L559009	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
L559008	u8015	m543	CLARK	Maybe I should sit this one out.
L558916	u8015	m543	CLARK	Don't worry, I've got you.
L558915	u8018	m543	LACY	I feel kind of light-headed . . .
L558914	u8018	m543	LACY	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
L558913	u8015	m543	CLARK	That sounds kind of pessimistic.
L558912	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
L558911	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
L558910	u8018	m543	LACY	What about here?
L558909	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
L558908	u8018	m543	LACY	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
L558907	u8015	m543	CLARK	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
L558906	u8018	m543	LACY	My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
L558905	u8015	m543	CLARK	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
L558904	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
L558899	u8018	m543	LACY	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
L558898	u8015	m543	CLARK	I've never been in a place like this before.
L558893	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
L558892	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
L558891	u8018	m543	LACY	You're late. Very late.
L558845	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
L558844	u8015	m543	CLARK	They make my eyes itch.
L558843	u8018	m543	LACY	That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
L558842	u8015	m543	CLARK	And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
L558841	u8018	m543	LACY	But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
L558840	u8015	m543	CLARK	I really don't think . . .
L558839	u8018	m543	LACY	It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
L559290	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
L559289	u8021	m543	LOIS	It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
L559191	u8015	m543	CLARK	You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
L559190	u8021	m543	LOIS	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
L559189	u8015	m543	CLARK	Superman? Has something happened to him?
L559187	u8021	m543	LOIS	You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
L559186	u8015	m543	CLARK	It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
L559151	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
L559150	u8015	m543	CLARK	. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
L559070	u8015	m543	CLARK	Politely?
L559069	u8021	m543	LOIS	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
L559068	u8015	m543	CLARK	'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
L558851	u8021	m543	LOIS	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
L558850	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
L558812	u8021	m543	LOIS	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
L558811	u8015	m543	CLARK	The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
L558801	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark . . . wait!
L558800	u8015	m543	CLARK	I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
L558799	u8021	m543	LOIS	No Paris?
L558777	u8021	m543	LOIS	Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
L558776	u8015	m543	CLARK	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
L558775	u8021	m543	LOIS	Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
L559175	u8020	m543	LEX	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
L559174	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
L559005	u8020	m543	LEX	If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
L559004	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And what do we get out of it?
L559001	u8020	m543	LEX	Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
L559000	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
L558999	u8020	m543	LEX	Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
L558997	u8020	m543	LEX	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
L558996	u8016	m543	HOWLER	But Superman isn't an average man.
L558995	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
L558994	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
L559310	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
L559309	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
L559308	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Go on . . .
L559307	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
L559306	u8017	m543	JEREMY	I'll try. . .
L559305	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
L559304	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Awesome!
L558967	u8017	m543	JEREMY	N-no...I mean...you bet.
L558966	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
L558963	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Absolutely!
L558962	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind taking a walk with me?
L558869	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm sorry.
L558868	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well, I don't understand.
L558866	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
L558865	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
L558864	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
L558863	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Impossible? Why?
L559208	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
L559207	u8018	m543	LACY	No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
L559206	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
L559205	u8018	m543	LACY	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
L559204	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
L559160	u8018	m543	LACY	Stuff it.
L559159	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Yes, darling?
L559158	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy . . . ?
L559157	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
L559156	u8018	m543	LACY	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
L559155	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
L558930	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
L558929	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
L558928	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
L558927	u8018	m543	LACY	Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
L558798	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Mr. White, come with me I want to see
L558797	u8018	m543	LACY	Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
L559105	u8021	m543	LOIS	It always is with Clark.
L559104	u8018	m543	LACY	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
L559103	u8021	m543	LOIS	Where's Clark?
L559079	u8021	m543	LOIS	Our other dinner guest.
L559078	u8018	m543	LACY	What's that?
L558974	u8021	m543	LOIS	Something . . . wonderful.
L558973	u8018	m543	LACY	What's he going to say?
L558957	u8018	m543	LACY	Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
L558956	u8021	m543	LOIS	But he's never there.
L558955	u8018	m543	LACY	Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
L558954	u8021	m543	LOIS	And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
L558953	u8018	m543	LACY	Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
L558952	u8021	m543	LOIS	That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
L558951	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
L558950	u8021	m543	LOIS	Who?
L558949	u8018	m543	LACY	I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
L558856	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
L558855	u8021	m543	LOIS	An angle?
L558854	u8018	m543	LACY	I think there's an angle.
L558849	u8018	m543	LACY	Superman gets mail here?
L558848	u8021	m543	LOIS	This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
L558809	u8021	m543	LOIS	. . . And  very na?ve!
L558808	u8018	m543	LACY	But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
L558807	u8021	m543	LOIS	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
L558806	u8018	m543	LACY	I think he's kind of cute.
L558804	u8021	m543	LOIS	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
L558803	u8018	m543	LACY	Is he for real?
L559260	u8019	m543	LENNY	Lucky I brought my drums.
L559259	u8020	m543	LEX	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
L559258	u8019	m543	LENNY	You think he'll find us.
L559229	u8020	m543	LEX	If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
L559228	u8019	m543	LENNY	Ready, Uncle Lex?
L559227	u8020	m543	LEX	Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
L559218	u8019	m543	LENNY	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
L559217	u8020	m543	LEX	This wasn't in the plan.
L559216	u8019	m543	LENNY	We'll all fry.
L559132	u8020	m543	LEX	My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
L559131	u8019	m543	LENNY	Boy, are you gonna get it.
L559056	u8019	m543	LENNY	What?
L559055	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
L559054	u8019	m543	LENNY	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
L559053	u8020	m543	LEX	He's . . . cold. . .
L559052	u8020	m543	LEX	Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
L559051	u8019	m543	LENNY	Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
L559050	u8020	m543	LEX	What was that about?
L559043	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're just an experiment, freako!
L559042	u8020	m543	LEX	Hey! Just remember I made you.

L559034	u8020	m543	LEX	There!
L559033	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
L559032	u8020	m543	LEX	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
L559031	u8019	m543	LENNY	The one Superman wrecked up?

L558924	u8020	m543	LEX	I must have miscalculated. How. . .

L558889	u8020	m543	LEX	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
L558888	u8019	m543	LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.

L560716	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
L560715	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Me?
L560712	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Got it? Otis?
L560711	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
L560710	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	One of them should've been you.
L560709	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
L560707	u8025	m544	ALBERT	--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
L560706	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Albert!
L560705	u8025	m544	ALBERT	It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
L560675	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!

L560668	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
L560630	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
L560629	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Thank you.
L560628	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You're a great architect, Albert.
L560627	u8025	m544	ALBERT	He's thirty-five years old.
L560626	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
L560397	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Shut up, apple-polisher.
L560396	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Nobody else.
L560395	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
L560392	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
L560391	u8025	m544	ALBERT	There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
L560350	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
L560349	u8025	m544	ALBERT	Bunkers!
L560348	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
L560344	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
L560343	u8025	m544	ALBERT	I know, but  --
L560700	u8029	m544	JIMMY	It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
L560699	u8026	m544	CLARK	What's she doing in California?
L560698	u8029	m544	JIMMY	She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
L560697	u8026	m544	CLARK	Lois isn't here?
L560696	u8029	m544	JIMMY	You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
L560695	u8026	m544	CLARK	It was hot, yes.
L560694	u8029	m544	JIMMY	A hot story, huh?
L560693	u8026	m544	CLARK	I've been on the job.
L560692	u8029	m544	JIMMY	You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
L560238	u8026	m544	CLARK	I will.
L560237	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Keep warm now.

L560235	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Do you know where you're headed?
L560231	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I know son, I know...
L560230	u8026	m544	CLARK	Mother...
L560229	u8035	m544	MARTHA	He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
L560228	u8026	m544	CLARK	I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
L560225	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I know.
L560224	u8026	m544	CLARK	Mom...
L560217	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
L560216	u8026	m544	CLARK	Don't worry, Mom. I know.
L560211	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
L560210	u8026	m544	CLARK	No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
L560209	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
L560562	u8033	m544	LOIS	Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
L560561	u8026	m544	CLARK	You're not the only one.
L560560	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
L560530	u8026	m544	CLARK	No thanks.
L560529	u8033	m544	LOIS	It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
L560528	u8026	m544	CLARK	Super...man. Hmmm...
L560527	u8033	m544	LOIS	They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
L560526	u8026	m544	CLARK	Is that what they're calling him?
L560525	u8033	m544	LOIS	Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
L560524	u8026	m544	CLARK	What'd you call him?
L560523	u8033	m544	LOIS	Of this...Superman.
L560522	u8026	m544	CLARK	Jealous? Of what?
L560521	u8033	m544	LOIS	You're just jealous.
L560520	u8026	m544	CLARK	I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
L560519	u8033	m544	LOIS	Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
L560518	u8026	m544	CLARK	Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
L560517	u8033	m544	LOIS	He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
L560516	u8026	m544	CLARK	Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
L560515	u8033	m544	LOIS	There weren't any wires. I looked.
L560514	u8026	m544	CLARK	It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
L560513	u8033	m544	LOIS	Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
L560512	u8026	m544	CLARK	Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
L560511	u8033	m544	LOIS	It wasn't a trick!
L560510	u8026	m544	CLARK	You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
L560509	u8033	m544	LOIS	I'm telling you, I was there.
L560426	u8026	m544	CLARK	Come again?
L560425	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not unless you can fly.
L560424	u8026	m544	CLARK	Can I take you to the airport?
L560422	u8026	m544	CLARK	Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
L560421	u8033	m544	LOIS	There's no real proof that tobacco  --
L560420	u8026	m544	CLARK	No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
L560419	u8033	m544	LOIS	For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
L560418	u8026	m544	CLARK	Don't you ever give up?
L560417	u8033	m544	LOIS	It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
L560416	u8026	m544	CLARK	Oh.
L560415	u8033	m544	LOIS	Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
L560414	u8026	m544	CLARK	Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
L560413	u8033	m544	LOIS	Big night coming up?
L560412	u8026	m544	CLARK	Huh?
L560411	u8033	m544	LOIS	What now, my love?
L560336	u8026	m544	CLARK	I just took a shot at it.
L560335	u8033	m544	LOIS	You described the exact contents of my purse.
L560334	u8026	m544	CLARK	Know what?
L560332	u8026	m544	CLARK	Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
L560331	u8033	m544	LOIS	You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
L560330	u8026	m544	CLARK	It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
L560328	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, for God's sake!
L560327	u8026	m544	CLARK	He may have a gun!
L560326	u8033	m544	LOIS	Stop him, Clark!
L560325	u8026	m544	CLARK	What the  --  !
L560324	u8033	m544	LOIS	Hey!
L560323	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
L560322	u8026	m544	CLARK	Unbelievable.
L560321	u8033	m544	LOIS	See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
L560303	u8033	m544	LOIS	'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
L560302	u8026	m544	CLARK	But otherwise it's swell.
L560301	u8033	m544	LOIS	Some people aren't the athletic type.
L560300	u8026	m544	CLARK	I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
L560299	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
L560298	u8026	m544	CLARK	Not really, no.
L560297	u8033	m544	LOIS	Are there any more at home like you?
L560296	u8026	m544	CLARK	Not really, no.
L560295	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not...gray.
L560294	u8026	m544	CLARK	Actually, she's silver-haired.
L560293	u8033	m544	LOIS	I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
L560292	u8026	m544	CLARK	No.
L560291	u8033	m544	LOIS	Your bookie?
L560279	u8033	m544	LOIS	Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
L560278	u8026	m544	CLARK	I'll bet you have some good ideas.
L560275	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well!
L560274	u8026	m544	CLARK	I'd like to.
L560789	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Okay.  Take me to your leader.
L560788	u8027	m544	EVE	What can I tell you? He's my leader.
L560787	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
L560786	u8027	m544	EVE	Oh.
L560785	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
L560784	u8027	m544	EVE	Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
L560783	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I'd better get you down.
L560782	u8027	m544	EVE	The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
L560781	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
L560780	u8027	m544	EVE	He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
L560779	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Besides that.
L560778	u8027	m544	EVE	Screaming
L560777	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	What are you doing here?
L560776	u8027	m544	EVE	Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
L560775	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
L560689	u8027	m544	EVE	You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
L560688	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Listen...thank you.
L560771	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Of course I can. I love you.
L560770	u8027	m544	EVE	You can't do this to me!
L560769	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What other one?
L560768	u8027	m544	EVE	I mean the other one!
L560767	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I'm wearing it.
L560766	u8027	m544	EVE	Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
L560765	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
L560764	u8027	m544	EVE	Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
L560763	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Lex is going bye-bye.
L560762	u8027	m544	EVE	Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
L560761	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
L560760	u8027	m544	EVE	What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
L560759	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You got wax in your ears?
L560758	u8027	m544	EVE	Tea?
L560757	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
L560756	u8027	m544	EVE	What are you going to do to him?
L560755	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
L560754	u8027	m544	EVE	Oh. Why? does he live up here?
L560753	u8027	m544	EVE	I didn't bring any  --
L560752	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
L560751	u8027	m544	EVE	This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
L560750	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
L560749	u8027	m544	EVE	I don't understand.
L560748	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
L560747	u8027	m544	EVE	A night on the town instead of under it?
L560746	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
L560745	u8027	m544	EVE	I know...
L560744	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
L560742	u8027	m544	EVE	I knew you'd hit me.
L560741	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
L560740	u8027	m544	EVE	You're not going to hit me?
L560739	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
L560738	u8027	m544	EVE	There was a recipe on the back  --
L560737	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No news is not good news. Y'know
L560733	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
L560732	u8027	m544	EVE	You?! How about me?
L560731	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Don't let me down.
L560728	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Nothing.
L560727	u8027	m544	EVE	But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
L560726	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	They stop for nothing.
L560724	u8027	m544	EVE	Ready.
L560723	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ready?
L560722	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
L560721	u8027	m544	EVE	You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
L560720	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
L560719	u8027	m544	EVE	I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
L560718	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
L560665	u8027	m544	EVE	The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
L560664	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What do you suggest, my dear?
L560663	u8027	m544	EVE	We just take it?
L560662	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
L560661	u8027	m544	EVE	You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
L560660	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	La de da da...
L560659	u8027	m544	EVE	You're happy, aren't you?
L560648	u8027	m544	EVE	I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
L560647	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
L560639	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No, you're going to get kissed,
L560638	u8027	m544	EVE	I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
L560637	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
L560636	u8027	m544	EVE	I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
L560635	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	"Ahh. 'National Geographic."" In my day, this made 'Playboy"" look like Mother Goose."
L560633	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Bingo!
L560632	u8027	m544	EVE	Meteorites!
L560625	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
L560624	u8027	m544	EVE	Mr. Romance...
L560623	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
L560622	u8027	m544	EVE	I'm going to bed.
L560621	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
L560620	u8027	m544	EVE	See?
L560618	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
L560617	u8027	m544	EVE	I read the article.
L560616	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
L560615	u8027	m544	EVE	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
L560614	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Krypton!
L560553	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
L560552	u8027	m544	EVE	Fifty degrees below and still falling.
L560551	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What's the temperature now?
L560550	u8027	m544	EVE	Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
L560549	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Damn!  This will get him.
L560548	u8027	m544	EVE	I didn't say a word.
L560547	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Shut up.
L560546	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You're on.
L560545	u8027	m544	EVE	Bet he makes it.
L560544	u8027	m544	EVE	Tough guy, huh?
L560543	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Nuts. He made it.
L560503	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	He's from another world.
L560502	u8027	m544	EVE	You think he's for real?
L560501	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
L560394	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	First the pets, Otis.
L560393	u8027	m544	EVE	Again???
L560390	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
L560389	u8027	m544	EVE	Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
L560365	u8027	m544	EVE	Even that would be an improvement.
L560364	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
L560363	u8027	m544	EVE	Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
L560362	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
L560361	u8027	m544	EVE	So I've noticed.
L560360	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
L560359	u8027	m544	EVE	This??
L560358	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
L560357	u8027	m544	EVE	Your father was a sick weirdo.
L560356	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	"My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."""
L560355	u8027	m544	EVE	Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
L560354	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
L560353	u8027	m544	EVE	It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
L560352	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
L560351	u8027	m544	EVE	You and your real estate.
L560127	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
L560126	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
L560123	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	If you persist, you leave us no choice.
L560122	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
L560117	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	And if I don't obey?
L560116	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
L560115	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
L560108	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	But so is Vond-El
L560107	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Then -
L560106	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
L560104	u8028	m544	FIRST ELDER	Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
L560103	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
L560271	u8029	m544	JIMMY	On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
L560270	u8033	m544	LOIS	Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
L560268	u8033	m544	LOIS	It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
L560267	u8029	m544	JIMMY	How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
L560266	u8033	m544	LOIS	Gets you where you live, huh?
L560265	u8029	m544	JIMMY	Boy!
L560263	u8033	m544	LOIS	'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
L560262	u8029	m544	JIMMY	Two.
L560261	u8033	m544	LOIS	"an Ode to Spring. are there one or two ""T's"" in bloodletting?"
L560260	u8029	m544	JIMMY	What're you writing, Lois?
L560215	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
L560214	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
L560213	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
L560191	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
L560190	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
L560181	u8035	m544	MARTHA	We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
L560180	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
L560179	u8035	m544	MARTHA	I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
L560178	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
L560177	u8035	m544	MARTHA	We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
L560176	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Folks'll ask question.
L560175	u8035	m544	MARTHA	All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
L560174	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	He sure as heck does that.
L560173	u8035	m544	MARTHA	The good lord works in mysterious ways.
L560172	u8035	m544	MARTHA	All of us.
L560171	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
L560169	u8035	m544	MARTHA	Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
L560168	u8030	m544	JONATHAN	What's your name, boy?
L560167	u8035	m544	MARTHA	It's a ...baby.
L560152	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
L560151	u8032	m544	LARA	I want to know what my child is going to face.
L560150	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	You've been doing some research in the archives.
L560138	u8032	m544	LARA	He will be odd, different.
L560137	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
L560136	u8032	m544	LARA	He'll be weightless.
L560135	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
L560134	u8032	m544	LARA	A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
L560133	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
L560132	u8032	m544	LARA	But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
L560131	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Lara, please...
L560130	u8032	m544	LARA	-- as we will be.
L560129	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
L560495	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
L560494	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	There are none of them any good anyway.
L560493	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
L560492	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Twenty-four.
L560491	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
L560490	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	How good it felt -
L560489	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	How good it felt!
L560488	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	No! You couldn't imagine -
L560487	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
L560486	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I guess I got carried away
L560485	u8031	m544	JOR-EL	Enjoyed it?
L560484	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
L560559	u8037	m544	PERRY	Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
L560558	u8033	m544	LOIS	He is. Usually.
L560557	u8037	m544	PERRY	If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
L560409	u8037	m544	PERRY	I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
L560408	u8033	m544	LOIS	Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
L560407	u8037	m544	PERRY	Lois, the kickback story...
L560285	u8033	m544	LOIS	Okay, but...why?  No offense.
L560284	u8037	m544	PERRY	Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
L560273	u8037	m544	PERRY	It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
L560272	u8033	m544	LOIS	Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
L560613	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
L560612	u8033	m544	LOIS	Where do you hail from?
L560611	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Very much.
L560610	u8033	m544	LOIS	Do you like pink?
L560609	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Sure.
L560608	u8033	m544	LOIS	Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
L560607	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Pink.
L560606	u8033	m544	LOIS	What color underwear am I wearing?
L560605	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Only when somebody shoots them at me.
L560604	u8033	m544	LOIS	Do bullets really bounce off you?
L560603	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
L560602	u8033	m544	LOIS	Is it true you're impervious to pain?
L560601	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Uh-huh.
L560600	u8033	m544	LOIS	Can you really see through anything?
L560599	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	What about it?
L560598	u8033	m544	LOIS	What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
L560597	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	195 pounds.
L560596	u8033	m544	LOIS	How much do you weigh?
L560595	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Thirty-five.
L560594	u8033	m544	LOIS	How old are you?
L560593	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	It's not bad.
L560592	u8033	m544	LOIS	It must feel great.
L560591	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
L560590	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh.
L560589	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
L560588	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
L560587	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I guess they are a little odd.
L560586	u8033	m544	LOIS	I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
L560585	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	You think they're strange?
L560584	u8033	m544	LOIS	Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
L560583	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Ask, You're the girl reporter.
L560582	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh.  Well, where do we start?
L560581	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
L560580	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
L560578	u8033	m544	LOIS	Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
L560577	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
L560576	u8033	m544	LOIS	If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
L560575	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
L560574	u8033	m544	LOIS	Well...flashlight?
L560572	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
L560571	u8033	m544	LOIS	This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
L560570	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
L560569	u8033	m544	LOIS	The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
L560568	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I came to talk to you.
L560567	u8033	m544	LOIS	Wha'...what are you doing here?
L560566	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Right on the first guess.
L560565	u8033	m544	LOIS	Superman???
L560564	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
L560563	u8033	m544	LOIS	With my luck, now it'll rain.
L560446	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
L560445	u8033	m544	LOIS	Who...who...
L560444	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
L560443	u8033	m544	LOIS	Oh, God! I'm going to die!
L560442	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Do as I say. Let go!
L560441	u8033	m544	LOIS	You've got me? Who's got you???
L560440	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Easy now, miss, I've got you???
L560714	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
L560713	u8036	m544	OTIS	Sort of.
L560704	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
L560703	u8036	m544	OTIS	I still don't get it.
L560654	u8036	m544	OTIS	Oh, Mr. Luthor...
L560653	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
L560652	u8036	m544	OTIS	Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
L560651	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
L560650	u8036	m544	OTIS	It's a Twinkie, boss.
L560649	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
L560643	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
L560642	u8036	m544	OTIS	You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
L560641	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
L560506	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
L560505	u8036	m544	OTIS	It is for me.
L560504	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Is that real enough for you?
L560402	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Otis...
L560401	u8036	m544	OTIS	Please...
L560387	u8036	m544	OTIS	I guess I...uh...regressed.
L560386	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
L560385	u8036	m544	OTIS	I...uh...check.
L560384	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I gave him this new face.
L560383	u8036	m544	OTIS	I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
L560382	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I gave him steady employment --
L560381	u8036	m544	OTIS	I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
L560380	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I broke the man out of prison --
L560379	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
L560378	u8036	m544	OTIS	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
L560377	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	What's the matter, Otis?
L560376	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
L560375	u8036	m544	OTIS	Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
L560374	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
L560373	u8036	m544	OTIS	There.
L560372	u8036	m544	OTIS	Yessir. Just what you wanted.
L560371	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
L560346	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
L560345	u8036	m544	OTIS	I...uh...
L560842	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	We'll see how fast I can fly.
L560841	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
L560838	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
L560837	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
L560833	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
L560832	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	They'll soon be over.
L560831	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
L560830	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
L560829	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Luthor  --
L560827	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	And garbage doors.
L560826	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	On radio waves?
L560825	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
L560821	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
L560820	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
L560819	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
L560818	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
L560817	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Maybe I should get help.
L560816	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
L560815	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
L560814	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
L560813	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
L560812	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
L560811	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
L560810	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
L560809	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Of time, Luthor.
L560808	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
L560807	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
L560806	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
L560805	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
L560795	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
L560794	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
L560793	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
L560672	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	But...why?
L560671	u8034	m544	LUTHOR	Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
L560670	u8038	m544	SUPERMAN	What is this??!
L621983	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Let's let Molly open one.
L621982	u8534	m579	ANDY	Which one can I open first?
L621980	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
L621979	u8534	m579	ANDY	Here!  In the car!
L621978	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
L621977	u8534	m579	ANDY	Woody!  Buzz!
L621976	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	What?  What is it?
L621975	u8534	m579	ANDY	Hey!  Wow!
L621905	u8534	m579	ANDY	Bye, house.
L621904	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	"Everybody say, ""Bye, house."""
L621812	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
L621811	u8534	m579	ANDY	But what if we leave them behind?
L621810	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
L621641	u8534	m579	ANDY	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
L621640	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
L621639	u8534	m579	ANDY	Right here in the van.
L621638	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Where was the last place you left him?
L621637	u8534	m579	ANDY	Mom, have you seen Woody?
L621491	u8534	m579	ANDY	Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
L621490	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Next stop...
L621479	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
L621478	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
L621477	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yeah?!
L621476	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
L621475	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can I help pump the gas?
L621471	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
L621470	u8534	m579	ANDY	I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
L621469	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay...
L621468	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
L621467	u8534	m579	ANDY	But Mom, I can't find him!
L621466	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
L621464	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	No, I haven't seen him.
L621463	u8534	m579	ANDY	Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
L621422	u8534	m579	ANDY	Just one?
L621421	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	You can bring ONE toy...
L621420	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can I bring some toys?
L621418	u8534	m579	ANDY	Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
L621417	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
L621416	u8534	m579	ANDY	To infinity and beyond!
L621271	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, yeah!
L621270	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
L621137	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay.
L621136	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
L621135	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yeah!
L621134	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, sure, we can leave it up.
L621133	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can we leave this up 'til we move?
L621132	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
L621131	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Whadda ya think?
L621130	u8534	m579	ANDY	Wow!  Cool!
L621990	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Mm-hmmmmm.
L621989	u8545	m579	WOODY	Say, isn't that mistletoe?
L621988	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
L621987	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
L621943	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Rocky!  The ramp!
L621942	u8545	m579	WOODY	We're almost there.
L621752	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
L621751	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	What are you doing over there?
L621363	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
L621362	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
L621315	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
L621314	u8545	m579	WOODY	You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
L621175	u8545	m579	WOODY	Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
L621174	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
L621173	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, hey - it was nothing.
L621172	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
L621171	u8545	m579	WOODY	Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
L622000	u8545	m579	WOODY	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
L621999	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
L621974	u8536	m579	BUZZ	We're not aiming for the truck!
L621973	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
L621972	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
L621971	u8536	m579	BUZZ	This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
L621970	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
L621968	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Not today!
L621967	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
L621962	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
L621961	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha-ha!!
L621960	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hold still, Buzz!
L621959	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody?!  What are you doing?
L621956	u8545	m579	WOODY	The match!
L621955	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  The rocket!
L621954	u8545	m579	WOODY	Great!
L621935	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look out!!
L621934	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, thanks for the ride.
L621916	u8536	m579	BUZZ	NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
L621915	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
L621914	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hold on, Woody!
L621902	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!
L621901	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
L621878	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's ok.  Everything's under control.
L621877	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What?!
L621876	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shhhhhhh!
L621842	u8545	m579	WOODY	We've got to get out of here...NOW.
L621841	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  It's the moving van.
L621839	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes Sir!
L621838	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
L621837	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
L621832	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
L621831	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But why would Andy want me?
L621830	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
L621829	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yeah, right.
L621828	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
L621827	u8536	m579	BUZZ	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
L621826	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
L621825	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
L621824	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
L621823	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
L621822	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
L621729	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Years of Academy training...wasted!!
L621728	u8545	m579	WOODY	Come on, this way!
L621727	u8545	m579	WOODY	Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
L621726	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
L621725	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
L621724	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
L621723	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Oh, I'm a sham!!
L621719	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
L621718	u8545	m579	WOODY	I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
L621717	u8536	m579	BUZZ	One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
L621716	u8545	m579	WOODY	What happened to you?
L621672	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shhh!
L621671	u8545	m579	WOODY	Don't tell me what to do!
L621670	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
L621667	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
L621666	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, stop it!!
L621665	u8545	m579	WOODY	Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
L621664	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
L621663	u8545	m579	WOODY	Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
L621662	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
L621661	u8536	m579	BUZZ	It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
L621660	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shield your eyes!
L621659	u8545	m579	WOODY	They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
L621658	u8545	m579	WOODY	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
L621657	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, we don't know what's out there!
L621655	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
L621654	u8545	m579	WOODY	I sure hope this isn't permanent.
L621633	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
L621632	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I've set my laser from stun to kill.
L621574	u8545	m579	WOODY	YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
L621573	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
L621555	u8545	m579	WOODY	Alright Buzz, get ready...
L621554	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Spaceship.
L621553	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where is it?  I don't see the --
L621552	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
L621551	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
L621550	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean it has hyperdrive?
L621549	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
L621542	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sorry.
L621541	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ow!  Watch where you're going!
L621524	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
L621523	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
L621522	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Well, then let's climb abroad.
L621521	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
L621520	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
L621516	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Go away.
L621515	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
L621503	u8545	m579	WOODY	WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
L621502	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
L621501	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
L621500	u8536	m579	BUZZ	My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
L621499	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
L621498	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
L621497	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
L621496	u8536	m579	BUZZ	According to my nava-computer, the --
L621487	u8545	m579	WOODY	No.
L621486	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But we're not on my planet, are we?
L621485	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh.  Oh, that's good.
L621484	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
L621483	u8545	m579	WOODY	Right?  Buddy?
L621429	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Then we've no time to lose!!
L621428	u8545	m579	WOODY	Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
L621427	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Trouble?!  Where?!
L621426	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
L621414	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
L621413	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I could have stopped him.
L621401	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean that happy child?
L621400	u8545	m579	WOODY	THAT is Sid!
L621399	u8545	m579	WOODY	No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
L621398	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sure is a hairy fellah.
L621397	u8545	m579	WOODY	That's why.  Sid.
L621396	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
L621395	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I'd better take a look anyway.
L621394	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
L621393	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's going on?
L621379	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where?
L621378	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
L621377	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You're mocking me, aren't you?
L621376	u8545	m579	WOODY	"You actually think you're THE ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!"
L621373	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
L621372	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't even think about it, cowboy!
L621371	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
L621370	u8545	m579	WOODY	And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
L621369	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
L621368	u8545	m579	WOODY	Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
L621346	u8545	m579	WOODY	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
L621345	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
L621340	u8536	m579	BUZZ	All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
L621339	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
L621338	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
L621337	u8545	m579	WOODY	Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
L621336	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Can!
L621335	u8545	m579	WOODY	You can't!
L621334	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yes, I can.
L621333	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, you can't.
L621332	u8536	m579	BUZZ	They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
L621329	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me.
L621328	u8545	m579	WOODY	He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
L621325	u8545	m579	WOODY	The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
L621324	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
L621323	u8545	m579	WOODY	T-O-Y.  Toy.
L621322	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Toy?
L621301	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
L621300	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
L621296	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Watch yourself!!
L621295	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
L621294	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
L621293	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
L621290	u8536	m579	BUZZ	HO-YAAAHH!!!
L621289	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hello-o-o...
L621773	u8545	m579	WOODY	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
L621772	u8537	m579	HAMM	Something's screwy here.
L621742	u8537	m579	HAMM	Everyone, it's Woody!
L621741	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hi!
L621331	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
L621330	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
L621319	u8537	m579	HAMM	What's with him?
L621318	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
L621259	u8545	m579	WOODY	Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
L621258	u8537	m579	HAMM	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
L621257	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
L621199	u8545	m579	WOODY	Stay calm, everyone!!
L621198	u8537	m579	HAMM	Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
L621197	u8545	m579	WOODY	It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
L621779	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Murderer!
L621778	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, that is disgusting.
L621740	u8537	m579	HAMM	He's in the psycho's bedroom!
L621739	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Son of a building block, it's Woody!
L621737	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	How 'bout three out of five?
L621736	u8537	m579	HAMM	No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
L621735	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
L621734	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Are you peeking?
L621733	u8537	m579	HAMM	Heh-heh.
L621732	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Ohhh!  You sunk it!
L621731	u8537	m579	HAMM	Miss.  G-6.
L621730	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	B-3.
L621456	u8537	m579	HAMM	I got dibs on his hat!
L621455	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Let's string him up by his pull- string!
L621243	u8537	m579	HAMM	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
L621242	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Hey, watch it!
L621202	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	I can't see a thing!

L621598	u8538	m579	HANNAH	What?
L621817	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
L621816	u8541	m579	REX	I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
L621815	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Will you quit moving around?!
L621814	u8541	m579	REX	Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
L621645	u8541	m579	REX	Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
L621644	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
L621403	u8541	m579	REX	He tortures toys -- just for fun.
L621402	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	That ain't no happy child.
L621327	u8541	m579	REX	Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
L621326	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
L621313	u8541	m579	REX	And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
L621312	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
L621279	u8541	m579	REX	Have you been replaced?
L621278	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.

L621783	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
L621782	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, it's not what you think, I swear!
L621781	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	You murdering dog!

L621762	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
L621761	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	You are a liar!
L621760	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
L621759	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
L621756	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
L621755	u8545	m579	WOODY	Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
L621448	u8545	m579	WOODY	Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
L621447	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
L621446	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
L621388	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
L621387	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Who is it this time?
L621365	u8545	m579	WOODY	Alright!  That's it!
L621364	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

L621320	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Laser-envy.
L621233	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	A lunchbox...?!
L621232	u8545	m579	WOODY	A lunchbox?!
L621192	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
L621191	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
L621771	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
L621770	u8541	m579	REX	Hey look!  It's Buzz!
L621769	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
L621766	u8541	m579	REX	Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
L621765	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
L621223	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
L621222	u8541	m579	REX	Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
L621213	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay, save your batteries!
L621212	u8541	m579	REX	Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
L621211	u8545	m579	WOODY	If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
L621196	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
L621195	u8541	m579	REX	But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
L621194	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
L621169	u8545	m579	WOODY	I was close to being scared that time.
L621168	u8541	m579	REX	Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
L621167	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
L621166	u8541	m579	REX	ROOAAAARR!!!
L621754	u8541	m579	REX	He got it, Woody!
L621753	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I got it, Woody!
L621473	u8541	m579	REX	There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
L621472	u8544	m579	SLINKY	It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
L621450	u8541	m579	REX	Oh, I don't like confrontations.
L621449	u8544	m579	SLINKY	We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
L621383	u8541	m579	REX	I thought he was at summer camp!
L621382	u8544	m579	SLINKY	It's Sid!
L621275	u8541	m579	REX	Woody?  Who's up there with you?
L621274	u8544	m579	SLINKY	What the heck is up there?
L621207	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
L621206	u8541	m579	REX	They're getting bigger.
L621998	u8542	m579	SARGENT	I can't quite make out -- 
L621997	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
L621264	u8545	m579	WOODY	Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
L621263	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
L621262	u8545	m579	WOODY	There.
L621245	u8545	m579	WOODY	So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
L621244	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
L621240	u8542	m579	SARGENT	It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
L621239	u8545	m579	WOODY	Last present!
L621238	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Okay, we're on the last present now...
L621229	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
L621228	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
L621227	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
L621216	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Yes SIR!
L621215	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
L621149	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay, thank you.  At ease.
L621148	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Sir!  No Sir!
L621147	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
L621893	u8545	m579	WOODY	That's right.  Your toys.
L621892	u8543	m579	SID	W-w-w-we?
L621889	u8543	m579	SID	It's busted.
L621888	u8545	m579	WOODY	Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
L621887	u8543	m579	SID	What?!
L621886	u8545	m579	WOODY	This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
L621885	u8543	m579	SID	Huh?
L621884	u8545	m579	WOODY	Reach for the sky!!
L621799	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sid!!!
L621798	u8543	m579	SID	Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
L621569	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is ludicrous.
L621392	u8543	m579	SID	Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
L621391	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
L621381	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-oh.
L621380	u8543	m579	SID	Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
L621953	u8545	m579	WOODY	Slink!  Hang on!
L621952	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I can't hold on much longer!
L621949	u8545	m579	WOODY	Speed up!
L621948	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody!  Speed up!
L621775	u8544	m579	SLINKY	See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
L621774	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
L621750	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I knew you'd come back, Woody!
L621749	u8545	m579	WOODY	Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
L621746	u8545	m579	WOODY	We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
L621745	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody?!
L621349	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
L621348	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
L621277	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
L621276	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
L621159	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Got it.
L621158	u8545	m579	WOODY	Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
L621157	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!
L621156	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Bad news?!
L621155	u8545	m579	WOODY	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
L621154	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
L621153	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, Slink --
L621152	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I'm red this time.
L621151	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Right here, Woody!
L621150	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, Slinky?
L660491	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
L660490	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
L660483	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L660482	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
L660481	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
L660477	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Yes, darling.
L660476	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
L660475	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
L660474	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
L659471	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
L659470	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!
L659442	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
L659441	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659440	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
L659439	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
L659385	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- all right.
L659384	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
L659383	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
L659382	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
L659379	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
L659378	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
L659377	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
L659376	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
L659375	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Aunt Em!
L659465	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
L659464	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Uhh -- yeah --
L659390	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659389	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, I hope we got them in time.
L659388	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659387	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
L659386	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
L659431	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
L659430	u8952	m610	HICKORY	All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
L659429	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
L659428	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
L659427	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
L659426	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
L659605	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	You'll be hist...
L659604	u8955	m610	MAYOR	From now on you'll be history
L659596	u8955	m610	MAYOR	Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
L659595	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	If any!
L659594	u8955	m610	MAYOR	Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
L659589	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	Is morally, ethic'ly
L659588	u8955	m610	MAYOR	If she?
L659587	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	If she...
L659586	u8955	m610	MAYOR	To see?
L659585	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	But we've got to verify it legally To see...
L659584	u8955	m610	MAYOR	As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
L660354	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	You are?
L660353	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
L660352	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Who are you?
L660351	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	... -- Oz -- has spoken!
L660342	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Do you presume to criticize the....
L660341	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
L660334	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Not so fast!  Not....
L660333	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
L660332	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	...resourceful!
L660330	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Oh ....
L660329	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
L660328	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	...have you come back?
L660087	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
L660086	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
L660085	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
L660084	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Our echo.
L660440	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Goodbye, folks!
L660439	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L660438	u8964	m610	WIZARD	I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
L660437	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
L660427	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
L660426	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh!
L660425	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
L660361	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh ....
L660360	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
L660357	u8964	m610	WIZARD	No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
L660356	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't believe you!
L660355	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uhhhh -- yes...
L659423	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
L659422	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Are you all right, Dorothy?
L659421	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
L659415	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
L659414	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Hickory!
L659413	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Who did it? Now wait a minute.
L659412	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!
L659411	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
L659410	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	This?
L659409	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
L659408	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
L659407	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
L660212	u8963	m610	WITCH	Catch him, you fool!
L660211	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Run, Toto, run!
L660208	u8963	m610	WITCH	No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
L660207	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
L660206	u8963	m610	WITCH	Ahh!  Ah!
L660205	u8963	m610	WITCH	That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
L660204	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
L660203	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
L660202	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
L660201	u8963	m610	WITCH	Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
L660200	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, please give me back my dog!
L660199	u8963	m610	WITCH	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
L660198	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
L659620	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
L659619	u8963	m610	WITCH	...didn't you?
L660472	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
L660471	u8951	m610	GLINDA	"And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."""
L660470	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
L660469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm ready now.
L660468	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
L660467	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you ready now?
L660462	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
L660461	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Whenever you wish.
L660460	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now?
L660459	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Toto, too.
L660458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...Toto, too?
L660448	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have?
L660447	u8951	m610	GLINDA	You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
L660446	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
L659644	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
L659643	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But, how do I start for Emerald City?
L659642	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
L659641	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, I'm afraid I didn't.
L659640	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
L659639	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
L659638	u8951	m610	GLINDA	No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
L659637	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
L659636	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
L659615	u8951	m610	GLINDA	That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
L659614	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I thought you said she was dead.
L659565	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
L659564	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
L659563	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
L659557	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
L659556	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Toto's my dog.
L659554	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh!  Well....
L659553	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
L659552	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
L660489	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But you couldn't have been, could you?
L660488	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- 
L659533	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
L659532	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
L659531	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
L659530	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you....
L659529	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
L659528	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- no!
L659527	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...bed.
L659526	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
L659525	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...paper?
L659524	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Has it poppies on the wall....
L659523	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...room --
L659521	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What's she doing now?
L659520	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Uh-huh.
L659519	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
L659517	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Me?
L659516	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
L659515	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659514	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
L659513	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's right.  What's she doing?
L659512	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Her -- her name is Emily.
L659511	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...That's Aunt Em.
L659510	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...her face is careworn.
L659507	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- yes.
L659506	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's our farm!
L659499	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
L659498	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
L659497	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659496	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, they won't - honestly.
L659495	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Aw, come, come, come --
L659494	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
L659493	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659492	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
L659491	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
L659488	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
L659487	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Yes --
L659486	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
L659485	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
L659484	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why --
L659483	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
L659482	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How did you guess?
L659481	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
L659473	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Stop her!
L659472	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
L659469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
L659468	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
L659467	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659466	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Now you're seeing reason.
L659458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
L659457	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
L660464	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
L660463	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
L660405	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Look -- it ticks!
L660404	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.
L660403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...!
L660402	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
L660337	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	You've had plenty of time already!
L660336	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
L660279	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I knew you would!
L660278	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Dorothy!
L660156	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
L660155	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh! Something bit me, too!
L660147	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
L660146	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No.  Why only --  Oh --
L660070	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
L660069	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, he's just ascared again.
L659992	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659991	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Can't that female take no for an answer?
L659881	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sure he could give you some courage.
L659880	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And him a brain.
L659853	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
L659852	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What sort of an animal is that?
L659851	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And bears!
L659835	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659834	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	We might.
L659825	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
L659824	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
L659811	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh-oh-
L659810	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
L659809	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659808	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh! Oh!
L659807	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh - I'll get it!
L659806	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
L659805	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
L659804	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
L659803	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh! They're - they're gone now.
L659793	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
L659792	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
L659791	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
L659788	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
L659787	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
L659786	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
L659785	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
L659778	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	All hollow.  Oh --
L659777	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659772	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --!
L659771	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
L659770	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, you're perfect now.
L659769	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
L659768	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
L659767	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
L659766	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
L659765	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...Oh, did that hurt?
L659764	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh --
L659763	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh...
L659762	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.

L659752	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oil can....

L659750	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oil can.....Oil can....
L659850	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my! 
L659849	u8961	m610	TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY	Lions and tigers and bears!

L660465	u8954	m610	LION	Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
L660444	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
L660443	u8954	m610	LION	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
L660442	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now I'll never get home!

L660166	u8954	m610	LION	I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
L660165	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
L660164	u8954	m610	LION	As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
L660160	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
L660159	u8954	m610	LION	That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
L660138	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --

L660073	u8954	m610	LION	I'd sooner wait outside.
L660072	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
L660071	u8954	m610	LION	I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
L660043	u8954	m610	LION	I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
L660042	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Supposin' you met an elephant?
L660041	u8954	m610	LION	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
L660040	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How about a hippopotamus?

L659894	u8954	m610	LION	The nerve.
L659893	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	A home --
L659887	u8954	m610	LION	Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
L659886	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.
L659885	u8954	m610	LION	...has been simply unbearable.

L659871	u8954	m610	LION	Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
L659870	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
L659869	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, but you tried to.
L659868	u8954	m610	LION	What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
L659425	u8953	m610	HUNK	What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?

L659404	u8953	m610	HUNK	Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
L659403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have so got brains.
L659402	u8953	m610	HUNK	Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.

L659942	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
L659941	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
L659940	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- there --
L659937	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659936	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
L659914	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
L659913	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...along.
L659879	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
L659878	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
L659833	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
L659832	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
L659831	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
L659823	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
L659822	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
L659819	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
L659818	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
L659790	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
L659789	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
L659760	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes --- there.
L659759	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	The other side....
L659758	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Here -- here --
L659757	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	He said his mouth.
L659754	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
L659753	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oil can what?
L659749	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Oh -- look --
L659748	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What?
L659747	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
L659746	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659745	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
L659735	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
L659734	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
L659726	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz!
L659725	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	To Oz?
L659724	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
L659723	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
L659722	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
L659720	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
L659719	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't blame you for that.
L659718	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
L659717	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
L659716	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- that's true.
L659715	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
L659714	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
L659713	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659712	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You're going to see a Wizard?
L659711	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
L659710	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Where's Kansas?
L659709	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659708	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They would?
L659707	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
L659695	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
L659694	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Did I scare you?
L659693	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
L659692	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...free!
L659691	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	My, it's good to be....
L659690	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh --
L659689	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
L659688	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- does it hurt you?
L659687	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
L659686	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohh!
L659685	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Ohhhh --
L659684	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.
L659680	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
L659679	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
L659678	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
L659661	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It's pleasant down that way, too.
L659660	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...don't talk.
L659632	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
L659631	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
L659630	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
L659626	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's too late!  There they....
L659625	u8963	m610	WITCH	The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
L659623	u8963	m610	WITCH	The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
L659622	u8951	m610	GLINDA	...ting the ruby slippers?
L659618	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
L659617	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Leave her alone!
L659616	u8963	m610	WITCH	Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
L660422	u8954	m610	LION	It did?
L660421	u8964	m610	WIZARD	...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
L660415	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
L660414	u8954	m610	LION	Dorothy next!

L660359	u8954	m610	LION	Yeah!

L660271	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Stop pushing!
L660260	u8954	m610	LION	Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
L660259	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on -- I've got another idea.
L660248	u8954	m610	LION	Now...
L660247	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Up!
L660240	u8954	m610	LION	All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
L660239	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	That's right.
L660238	u8954	m610	LION	I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?

L660233	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I've got a plan how to get in there.
L660189	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
L660188	u8954	m610	LION	They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
L660083	u8954	m610	LION	What was that?
L660082	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Here --   Come on.
L660081	u8954	m610	LION	I -- Oh --

L660079	u8954	m610	LION	Somebody pulled my tail.
L660078	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What happened?
L660068	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What's the matter?
L660067	u8954	m610	LION	Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
L660062	u8954	m610	LION	I don't know.
L660061	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Who at?
L660060	u8954	m610	LION	Would...would it do any good if I roared?
L660045	u8954	m610	LION	I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
L660044	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What if it were a brontosaurus?
L659925	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't you start it, too!
L659924	u8954	m610	LION	Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.

L660217	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
L660192	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
L660191	u8954	m610	LION	Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
L660190	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.

L659451	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?

L660187	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, that's you all over.
L660186	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!

L659906	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Hurry -- hurry --
L659905	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on -- come on --
L659892	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	A heart --
L659891	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Then I'm sure to get a brain --
L659889	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'd be clever as a gizzard --
L659888	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'd be gentle as a lizard --
L659837	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
L659836	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Animals that -- that eat straw?
L659829	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	To Oz!
L659828	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz?
L659827	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	We do.
L659826	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	That's right.
L659821	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	No, sir!
L659820	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No, sir!
L659802	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
L659801	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
L659774	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
L659773	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Beautiful!  What an echo!
L660392	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
L660391	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	How can I ever thank you enough?
L660388	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Th.D.?
L660387	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
L660381	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You promised us real things -- a real...
L660380	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well --
L660373	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660372	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
L660371	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660370	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
L660369	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660368	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about us?
L660367	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes.
L660366	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It makes you nervous?
L660365	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
L660436	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Help!
L660435	u8964	m610	WIZARD	-- Ruined my exit!
L660434	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
L660433	u8964	m610	WIZARD	This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
L660432	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Stop that dog!
L660398	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes -- ....
L660397	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	But I still want one.
L660396	u8964	m610	WIZARD	As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
