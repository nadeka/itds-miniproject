L8208	u121	m7	RICK	Then we'll stay up together.
L8207	u115	m7	ALICE	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
L8206	u121	m7	RICK	We'll figure it out.
L8204	u121	m7	RICK	I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
L8203	u115	m7	ALICE	I can't go back to sleep again.
L8202	u121	m7	RICK	Yeah, or turn you into toast.
L8201	u115	m7	ALICE	It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
L8200	u121	m7	RICK	Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
L8199	u115	m7	ALICE	I can't find him.
L8198	u121	m7	RICK	Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
L8197	u115	m7	ALICE	It was bad.
L8196	u121	m7	RICK	I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
L8156	u115	m7	ALICE	Kristen...
L8155	u121	m7	RICK	You alright?
L8097	u115	m7	ALICE	What?
L8096	u121	m7	RICK	Kincaid and Joey died last night.
L8095	u115	m7	ALICE	What's wrong?
L8094	u121	m7	RICK	Alice, you think you can leave?
L8037	u121	m7	RICK	Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
L8036	u115	m7	ALICE	Rick...I can't.
L8035	u121	m7	RICK	Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
L8034	u115	m7	ALICE	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
L8033	u121	m7	RICK	Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
L8032	u115	m7	ALICE	I don't want to.
L8031	u121	m7	RICK	The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
L8030	u115	m7	ALICE	What?
L8029	u121	m7	RICK	Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
L8101	u119	m7	KRISTEN	You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
L8100	u115	m7	ALICE	Kristen, what happened?
L8063	u119	m7	KRISTEN	When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
L8062	u115	m7	ALICE	You what?
L8060	u115	m7	ALICE	When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
L8059	u119	m7	KRISTEN	How'd you learn so much about dreams?
L8058	u115	m7	ALICE	I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
L8057	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
L8056	u115	m7	ALICE	No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
L8055	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Sounds like a game show host to me.
L8054	u115	m7	ALICE	My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
L8053	u119	m7	KRISTEN	You could do worse.
L8052	u115	m7	ALICE	I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
L8051	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
L8050	u115	m7	ALICE	I'm sure they're around.
L8049	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
L8048	u115	m7	ALICE	Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
L8179	u122	m7	SHEILA	Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
L8178	u115	m7	ALICE	Then you saw him, too?
L8177	u122	m7	SHEILA	That obvious, huh?
L8176	u115	m7	ALICE	You've been up all night?
L8175	u122	m7	SHEILA	What?
L8174	u115	m7	ALICE	We have matching luggage.
L8173	u122	m7	SHEILA	Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
L8087	u115	m7	ALICE	I know.
L8086	u122	m7	SHEILA	Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
L8085	u115	m7	ALICE	I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
L8084	u122	m7	SHEILA	I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
L8083	u115	m7	ALICE	You in a hurry?
L8324	u115	m7	ALICE	Save it for later.  Come on!
L8323	u116	m7	DAN	You look great!
L8295	u115	m7	ALICE	Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
L8294	u116	m7	DAN	What the hell was that?
L8290	u116	m7	DAN	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
L8289	u115	m7	ALICE	Here we are.
L8288	u116	m7	DAN	You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
L8287	u115	m7	ALICE	He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
L8278	u115	m7	ALICE	It's okay, we're just about there.
L8277	u116	m7	DAN	As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
L8276	u116	m7	DAN	Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
L8275	u115	m7	ALICE	You just feel sorry for me.
L8274	u116	m7	DAN	Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
L8273	u115	m7	ALICE	He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
L8255	u116	m7	DAN	Who?
L8254	u115	m7	ALICE	Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
L8253	u116	m7	DAN	Then what else can we do?
L8252	u115	m7	ALICE	Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
L8251	u116	m7	DAN	Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
L8250	u115	m7	ALICE	You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
L8248	u115	m7	ALICE	I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
L8247	u116	m7	DAN	Is there something we can do?
L8246	u115	m7	ALICE	Not really.
L8218	u115	m7	ALICE	Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
L8217	u116	m7	DAN	Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
L8216	u115	m7	ALICE	Three days.
L8215	u116	m7	DAN	How long have you been awake?
L8214	u115	m7	ALICE	The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
L8213	u116	m7	DAN	No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
L8212	u115	m7	ALICE	Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
L8211	u116	m7	DAN	Extra money, huh?
L8210	u115	m7	ALICE	I've been working double shifts.
L8190	u116	m7	DAN	Kristen's story really got to her.
L8189	u115	m7	ALICE	No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
L8166	u116	m7	DAN	In her dream?
L8165	u115	m7	ALICE	I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
L8162	u115	m7	ALICE	It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
L8161	u116	m7	DAN	I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
L8080	u115	m7	ALICE	I know.  Uh...Alice.
L8079	u116	m7	DAN	Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
L8078	u115	m7	ALICE	Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
L8077	u116	m7	DAN	You're his sister, right?
L8076	u115	m7	ALICE	No...
L8187	u115	m7	ALICE	I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
L8186	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Enough of that crap.
L8185	u115	m7	ALICE	It was Freddy.
L8184	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
L8092	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
L8091	u115	m7	ALICE	I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
L7996	u117	m7	DEBBIE	Alright, I think I see salvation...
L7995	u115	m7	ALICE	Rick, please.
L8229	u121	m7	RICK	What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
L8228	u116	m7	DAN	About Freddy?
L8227	u121	m7	RICK	She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
L8226	u116	m7	DAN	How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
L8225	u121	m7	RICK	Been up with Alice.
L8159	u121	m7	RICK	She knew she was gonna die.
L8158	u116	m7	DAN	Hey man, we're all sorry...
L8126	u121	m7	RICK	Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
L8125	u116	m7	DAN	Nice neighborhood.
L8124	u121	m7	RICK	It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
L8123	u116	m7	DAN	So?
L8122	u121	m7	RICK	She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
L8121	u116	m7	DAN	So what's up?  What'd I miss?
L8120	u121	m7	RICK	Let me talk to you.
L8119	u116	m7	DAN	I don't get it.
L8099	u121	m7	RICK	Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
L8098	u116	m7	DAN	Hey, Rick!
L7994	u121	m7	RICK	Earth to Alice...
L7993	u116	m7	DAN	T-T-Thanks Alice...
L8143	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
L8142	u118	m7	ELAINE	Honey, we went over this in therapy.
L8141	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
L8140	u118	m7	ELAINE	I'm sorry honey, but...
L8138	u118	m7	ELAINE	Your distraught.  It'll help...
L8137	u119	m7	KRISTEN	What's wrong with me?
L8136	u118	m7	ELAINE	You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
L8135	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
L8134	u118	m7	ELAINE	Something the matter with the cuisine?
L8118	u119	m7	KRISTEN	I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
L8117	u121	m7	RICK	It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
L8116	u119	m7	KRISTEN	It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
L8115	u121	m7	RICK	I'll tell you later.
L8106	u119	m7	KRISTEN	It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
L8105	u121	m7	RICK	I though Freddy was just an old town story.
L8104	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
L8065	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Oh God!  He killed them!
L8064	u121	m7	RICK	What is it?
L7984	u121	m7	RICK	When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
L7983	u119	m7	KRISTEN	What?
L7982	u121	m7	RICK	Avoid-all-contact-day.
L7981	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Something wrong with the stairs?
L8072	u120	m7	NURSE	Don't worry, honey
L8071	u119	m7	KRISTEN	You don't get it, he's after me...
L8070	u120	m7	NURSE	You just stay put.  You need rest.
L8069	u119	m7	KRISTEN	I gotta get out of here.
L8068	u120	m7	NURSE	You had a nasty bump.
L8067	u119	m7	KRISTEN	Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
L8066	u120	m7	NURSE	Feeling better now?
L8729	u123	m8	ALICE	You're not taking my baby!
L8728	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
L8725	u123	m8	ALICE	"What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?..."
L8724	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
L8722	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	And ours.  It's our grandchild.
L8721	u123	m8	ALICE	Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
L8718	u123	m8	ALICE	What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
L8717	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
L8420	u123	m8	ALICE	It's okay, Dan
L8419	u129	m8	MRS. JORDAN	Excuse us, dear.
L8806	u127	m8	JACOB	He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
L8805	u123	m8	ALICE	But how...?
L8804	u127	m8	JACOB	It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
L8803	u123	m8	ALICE	What do you mean?
L8802	u127	m8	JACOB	He's inside you, where he hides.
L8801	u123	m8	ALICE	Where is he?
L8793	u123	m8	ALICE	Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
L8792	u127	m8	JACOB	Mommy...?
L8657	u127	m8	JACOB	My friend, with the funny hand.
L8656	u123	m8	ALICE	Who says I don't like you?
L8654	u123	m8	ALICE	Who said I...wait, what?
L8653	u127	m8	JACOB	No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
L8652	u123	m8	ALICE	Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
L8651	u127	m8	JACOB	She doesn't want me around
L8650	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
L8649	u127	m8	JACOB	No...
L8648	u123	m8	ALICE	Is that who you're waiting for?
L8645	u127	m8	JACOB	Been having bad dreams.
L8644	u123	m8	ALICE	Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
L8543	u127	m8	JACOB	I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
L8542	u123	m8	ALICE	How did you know that?
L8541	u127	m8	JACOB	I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
L8540	u123	m8	ALICE	My name is...
L8539	u127	m8	JACOB	It's lonely in there, in my room.
L8538	u123	m8	ALICE	Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
L8536	u123	m8	ALICE	Huh?
L8535	u127	m8	JACOB	Hey...wake up.
L8414	u123	m8	ALICE	Me too.
L8413	u125	m8	DAN	There you go.  Love you.
L8412	u123	m8	ALICE	You're right.
L8411	u125	m8	DAN	You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
L8410	u123	m8	ALICE	Yeah...I guess.
L8409	u125	m8	DAN	You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
L8408	u123	m8	ALICE	No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
L8407	u125	m8	DAN	About him?
L8405	u125	m8	DAN	He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
L8404	u123	m8	ALICE	Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
L8403	u125	m8	DAN	Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
L8402	u123	m8	ALICE	I know.
L8401	u125	m8	DAN	They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
L8400	u123	m8	ALICE	The tickets.
L8397	u125	m8	DAN	Sorry, babe.
L8396	u123	m8	ALICE	Jesus!  Don't do that!
L8395	u125	m8	DAN	Hi, beautiful.
L8783	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Now.
L8782	u123	m8	ALICE	But Dad --
L8781	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
L8780	u123	m8	ALICE	I've got to go.
L8779	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Alice!
L8580	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
L8579	u123	m8	ALICE	You disappointed in me?
L8578	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Since my little girl became a mom...
L8577	u123	m8	ALICE	Since when are you such a smart shopper?
L8576	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Alice...
L8575	u123	m8	ALICE	Very funny.
L8574	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Sobering...
L8573	u123	m8	ALICE	How was the meeting?
L8525	u123	m8	ALICE	Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
L8524	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	I'm so sorry, honey...
L8451	u123	m8	ALICE	It's just across the park.
L8450	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
L8449	u123	m8	ALICE	Thanks for everything, Dad.
L8447	u123	m8	ALICE	To take a picture.
L8446	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	Where are we going?
L8444	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
L8443	u123	m8	ALICE	Dad!
L8442	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	No.  A deal's a deal.
L8441	u123	m8	ALICE	That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
L8440	u124	m8	ALICE'S DAD	"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."
L8439	u123	m8	ALICE	I was afraid you weren't coming.
L8819	u123	m8	ALICE	That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
L8818	u130	m8	YVONNE	He sure loves to stay awake.
L8817	u123	m8	ALICE	So did Dan.
L8816	u130	m8	YVONNE	You do good work, Alice.
L8778	u123	m8	ALICE	We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
L8777	u130	m8	YVONNE	But how are we gonna --
L8776	u123	m8	ALICE	Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
L8775	u130	m8	YVONNE	What?
L8770	u123	m8	ALICE	If they actually bothered to bury her.
L8769	u130	m8	YVONNE	You think that's the place she's buried?
L8760	u130	m8	YVONNE	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
L8759	u123	m8	ALICE	Are you alright?
L8705	u123	m8	ALICE	That's the only reason you're alive...
L8704	u130	m8	YVONNE	Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
L8700	u123	m8	ALICE	Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
L8699	u130	m8	YVONNE	All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
L8698	u123	m8	ALICE	What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
L8697	u130	m8	YVONNE	And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
L8696	u123	m8	ALICE	Krueger is reality.
L8695	u130	m8	YVONNE	I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
L8677	u123	m8	ALICE	I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
L8676	u130	m8	YVONNE	I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
L8675	u123	m8	ALICE	Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
L8674	u130	m8	YVONNE	Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
L8673	u123	m8	ALICE	I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
L8672	u130	m8	YVONNE	You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
L8621	u130	m8	YVONNE	Why don't you two stick to reality.
L8620	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
L8614	u123	m8	ALICE	No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
L8613	u130	m8	YVONNE	It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
L8565	u130	m8	YVONNE	When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
L8564	u123	m8	ALICE	What's that got to do with it?
L8552	u130	m8	YVONNE	They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
L8551	u123	m8	ALICE	Did everyone call everyone?
L8547	u123	m8	ALICE	He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
L8546	u130	m8	YVONNE	There aren't any little boys on your floor.
L8545	u123	m8	ALICE	Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
L8523	u130	m8	YVONNE	Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
L8522	u123	m8	ALICE	It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
L8394	u130	m8	YVONNE	Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
L8393	u123	m8	ALICE	Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
L8365	u123	m8	ALICE	No, the Dan part was nice...
L8364	u130	m8	YVONNE	Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
L8363	u123	m8	ALICE	Had kind of a long night.
L8362	u130	m8	YVONNE	Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
L8743	u128	m8	MARK	She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
L8742	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't understand.
L8741	u128	m8	MARK	No shit.
L8740	u123	m8	ALICE	Poor woman...
L8739	u128	m8	MARK	Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
L8738	u123	m8	ALICE	But I've seen her grave.
L8737	u128	m8	MARK	They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
L8736	u123	m8	ALICE	Meaning?
L8735	u128	m8	MARK	That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
L8734	u123	m8	ALICE	No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
L8733	u128	m8	MARK	That's their problem.
L8732	u123	m8	ALICE	They think I'm nuts.
L8711	u128	m8	MARK	Then we'll find another way.
L8710	u123	m8	ALICE	I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
L8671	u128	m8	MARK	I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
L8670	u123	m8	ALICE	Where are you going?
L8668	u123	m8	ALICE	I don't know!
L8667	u128	m8	MARK	Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
L8665	u128	m8	MARK	What, you named it already?
L8664	u123	m8	ALICE	My baby!
L8663	u128	m8	MARK	Who's Jacob?
L8640	u123	m8	ALICE	Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
L8639	u128	m8	MARK	Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
L8638	u123	m8	ALICE	It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
L8637	u128	m8	MARK	Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
L8634	u123	m8	ALICE	Nobody thinks that.
L8633	u128	m8	MARK	Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
L8627	u123	m8	ALICE	Mark!
L8626	u128	m8	MARK	Then get out!
L8617	u123	m8	ALICE	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
L8616	u128	m8	MARK	I thought about that.
L8612	u128	m8	MARK	I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
L8611	u123	m8	ALICE	I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
L8610	u128	m8	MARK	Yeah.  I'm just aces.
L8609	u123	m8	ALICE	Mark, are you okay?
L8557	u123	m8	ALICE	That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
L8556	u128	m8	MARK	I've got to write some of this down.
L8424	u128	m8	MARK	Well we gotta do something!
L8423	u123	m8	ALICE	My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
L8383	u128	m8	MARK	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
L8382	u123	m8	ALICE	Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
L8377	u128	m8	MARK	I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
L8376	u123	m8	ALICE	Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
L8495	u126	m8	GRETA	I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
L8494	u128	m8	MARK	Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
L8490	u128	m8	MARK	Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
L8489	u126	m8	GRETA	Who?
L8488	u128	m8	MARK	He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
L8422	u126	m8	GRETA	You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
L8421	u128	m8	MARK	That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
L8381	u126	m8	GRETA	Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
L8380	u128	m8	MARK	Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
L8375	u128	m8	MARK	My undying love.  Have some.
L8374	u126	m8	GRETA	Next life.  Oh, what's that?
L8373	u128	m8	MARK	Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
L8571	u130	m8	YVONNE	All of us.  Right?
L8570	u126	m8	GRETA	Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
L8563	u126	m8	GRETA	Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
L8562	u130	m8	YVONNE	Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
L8559	u126	m8	GRETA	I want to talk about the baby.
L8558	u130	m8	YVONNE	Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
L8484	u126	m8	GRETA	Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
L8483	u130	m8	YVONNE	Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
L8482	u126	m8	GRETA	Have another one, sounds like you need it.
L8427	u130	m8	YVONNE	That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
L8426	u126	m8	GRETA	Yeah...
L8425	u130	m8	YVONNE	All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
L8367	u130	m8	YVONNE	Makes you look like a nun--
L8366	u126	m8	GRETA	These things are wild...  What do you think?
L8703	u128	m8	MARK	He invited me to his house last night.
L8702	u130	m8	YVONNE	You, too?
L8630	u128	m8	MARK	Stick around, please?
L8629	u130	m8	YVONNE	It's okay.
L8625	u130	m8	YVONNE	I can't listen to this.
L8624	u128	m8	MARK	I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
L8623	u130	m8	YVONNE	Mark...
L8622	u128	m8	MARK	Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
L8499	u128	m8	MARK	Faint.
L8498	u130	m8	YVONNE	Vomit?
L8481	u130	m8	YVONNE	Two hours a day, six days a week.
L8480	u128	m8	MARK	Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
L84067	u488	m30	AMOS	Good luck, kid.
L84066	u492	m30	EDWARD	Thank you.
L84065	u488	m30	AMOS	Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
L84064	u492	m30	EDWARD	There's only one I want.
L84063	u488	m30	AMOS	I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
L84062	u488	m30	AMOS	That would explain the indigestion.
L84061	u492	m30	EDWARD	A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
L84060	u488	m30	AMOS	Didn't kill anything, did I?
L84045	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
L84044	u488	m30	AMOS	Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
L84043	u492	m30	EDWARD	I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
L84041	u488	m30	AMOS	Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
L84040	u492	m30	EDWARD	Someone stole my backpack.
L84039	u492	m30	EDWARD	I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
L84038	u488	m30	AMOS	Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
L84037	u492	m30	EDWARD	What do you mean? You don't even know me.
L84036	u488	m30	AMOS	Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
L84035	u492	m30	EDWARD	Who is she? Where does she live?
L84034	u488	m30	AMOS	I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
L84033	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yes!
L84032	u488	m30	AMOS	Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
L84031	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
L84030	u488	m30	AMOS	Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
L84029	u492	m30	EDWARD	I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
L84028	u488	m30	AMOS	See! The big guy likes it.
L84024	u492	m30	EDWARD	That's great.
L84023	u488	m30	AMOS	Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
L84021	u492	m30	EDWARD	It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
L84020	u488	m30	AMOS	Great, great. That's fantastic.
L83943	u492	m30	EDWARD	I don't expect to.
L83942	u489	m30	BEAMEN	You won't find a better place!
L83939	u489	m30	BEAMEN	No one's ever left.
L83938	u492	m30	EDWARD	This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
L83937	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Why?
L83936	u492	m30	EDWARD	I have to leave. Tonight.
L83899	u492	m30	EDWARD	It truly is.
L83898	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
L83896	u492	m30	EDWARD	No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
L83895	u489	m30	BEAMEN	He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
L83894	u492	m30	EDWARD	The poet? What ever happened to him?
L83893	u489	m30	BEAMEN	The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
L83892	u492	m30	EDWARD	What is this place?
L83886	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Not yet.
L83885	u492	m30	EDWARD	You were expecting me?
L83884	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
L83883	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yes.
L83882	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Bloom like a flower?
L83881	u492	m30	EDWARD	Edward Bloom.
L83880	u489	m30	BEAMEN	Welcome to ya. What's your name?
L84093	u492	m30	EDWARD	I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
L84092	u490	m30	DON PRICE	What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
L84091	u492	m30	EDWARD	Don.
L84090	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Bloom!
L83739	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Let's see it.
L83738	u492	m30	EDWARD	I brought it.
L83737	u490	m30	DON PRICE	You get the eye?
L83733	u492	m30	EDWARD	Fine, I'm doing it.
L83732	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Fine, you do it.
L83731	u492	m30	EDWARD	Fine, I will.
L83730	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Then do it.
L83729	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
L83728	u490	m30	DON PRICE	Or are you too scared?
L84364	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
L84363	u498	m30	WILL	No.
L84362	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
L84361	u498	m30	WILL	A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
L84360	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
L84359	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
L84358	u498	m30	WILL	How would you describe him?
L84357	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Thirty years. Maybe more.
L84356	u498	m30	WILL	How long have you known my father?
L84355	u498	m30	WILL	My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
L84354	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
L83774	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
L83773	u498	m30	WILL	Can I see him?
L83767	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	A pleasure.
L83766	u498	m30	WILL	Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
L83765	u491	m30	DR. BENNETT	Will.
L84318	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
L84317	u493	m30	JENNY	Lucky girl.
L84316	u492	m30	EDWARD	And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
L84315	u493	m30	JENNY	I know.
L84314	u492	m30	EDWARD	Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
L84307	u493	m30	JENNY	Go.
L84306	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll...
L84305	u493	m30	JENNY	Please. Go. Just go.
L84304	u492	m30	EDWARD	Lord, I'm sorry I...
L84303	u492	m30	EDWARD	I can get it. I can just...
L84302	u493	m30	JENNY	It's okay, just leave it.
L84300	u492	m30	EDWARD	I see. I thank you for your time.
L84299	u493	m30	JENNY	I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
L84298	u493	m30	JENNY	I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
L84297	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
L84295	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
L84294	u493	m30	JENNY	I'm not convinced you should be happy.
L84293	u492	m30	EDWARD	Helping people makes me happy.
L84291	u492	m30	EDWARD	It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
L84290	u493	m30	JENNY	Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
L84289	u492	m30	EDWARD	In so many words, yes.
L84287	u492	m30	EDWARD	I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
L84286	u493	m30	JENNY	So I've heard.
L84285	u492	m30	EDWARD	Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
L84284	u493	m30	JENNY	No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
L84283	u492	m30	EDWARD	How did you know?
L84282	u493	m30	JENNY	You must be Edward Bloom.
L83945	u492	m30	EDWARD	I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
L83944	u493	m30	JENNY	Promise me you'll come back.
L83941	u492	m30	EDWARD	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
L83940	u493	m30	JENNY	How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
L83931	u493	m30	JENNY	And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
L83930	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're pretty good at arithmetic.
L83929	u493	m30	JENNY	I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
L83928	u492	m30	EDWARD	Eighteen.
L83927	u493	m30	JENNY	How old are you?
L83924	u493	m30	JENNY	It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
L83923	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yeah.
L83922	u493	m30	JENNY	Was she nekkid?
L83921	u492	m30	EDWARD	Well, she... uh...
L83920	u493	m30	JENNY	What did she look like?
L83919	u492	m30	EDWARD	Did you see that woman?
L84115	u492	m30	EDWARD	And I like you.
L84114	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I like your stories.
L84113	u492	m30	EDWARD	I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
L84112	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You were talking about your wedding.
L84111	u492	m30	EDWARD	There was one time when I was eleven...
L84110	u492	m30	EDWARD	Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
L84109	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
L84108	u492	m30	EDWARD	Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
L84107	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
L84011	u492	m30	EDWARD	Well, it's not a short one.
L84010	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Oh, so this is a tall tale?
L84009	u492	m30	EDWARD	Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
L84008	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I never knew.
L84007	u492	m30	EDWARD	That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
L84004	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Please?
L84003	u492	m30	EDWARD	You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
L84002	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Can I take your picture?
L84001	u492	m30	EDWARD	Spooning the sherbet.
L83999	u492	m30	EDWARD	They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
L83998	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Stop.
L83997	u492	m30	EDWARD	He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
L83995	u492	m30	EDWARD	He was slipping her a little extra cream.
L83994	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	No, I understand.
L83993	u492	m30	EDWARD	Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
L83991	u492	m30	EDWARD	"Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, ""Your Grampa is going to die."" Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead."
L83990	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	That's terrible.
L83989	u492	m30	EDWARD	"Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, ""Your Aunt is going to die."" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead."
L83987	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	What were you dreaming about?
L83986	u492	m30	EDWARD	I was dreaming.
L83985	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Hi. How are you feeling?
L83958	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
L83957	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Really.
L83875	u492	m30	EDWARD	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
L83874	u495	m30	KARL	You're not trying to run away?
L83873	u492	m30	EDWARD	That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
L83872	u495	m30	KARL	You know anyone's who's taken it?
L83869	u492	m30	EDWARD	Beats me.
L83868	u495	m30	KARL	What did she say?
L83860	u492	m30	EDWARD	Okay.
L83859	u495	m30	KARL	Okay.
L83858	u492	m30	EDWARD	I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
L83857	u495	m30	KARL	You don't like it?
L83856	u492	m30	EDWARD	Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
L83855	u495	m30	KARL	Karl.
L83854	u492	m30	EDWARD	What's your name, Giant?
L83853	u495	m30	KARL	You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
L83852	u492	m30	EDWARD	So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
L83851	u495	m30	KARL	I can.
L83850	u492	m30	EDWARD	Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
L83849	u495	m30	KARL	Really?
L83848	u492	m30	EDWARD	Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
L84408	u492	m30	EDWARD	Yes. Exactly.
L84407	u498	m30	WILL	You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
L84402	u492	m30	EDWARD	Story of my life.
L84401	u498	m30	WILL	It's unbelievable.
L84398	u492	m30	EDWARD	The River!
L84397	u498	m30	WILL	You say...
L84396	u498	m30	WILL	Where are we headed?
L84383	u498	m30	WILL	Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
L84382	u492	m30	EDWARD	Let's get out of here.
L84378	u498	m30	WILL	Okay. Okay.
L84377	u492	m30	EDWARD	Like this.
L84376	u498	m30	WILL	I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
L84373	u492	m30	EDWARD	How I go.
L84372	u498	m30	WILL	How what happens?
L84371	u492	m30	EDWARD	Tell me how it happens.
L84370	u498	m30	WILL	The river?
L84369	u492	m30	EDWARD	The river.
L84193	u492	m30	EDWARD	I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
L84192	u498	m30	WILL	Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
L84191	u492	m30	EDWARD	What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
L84190	u492	m30	EDWARD	It would kill you, huh?
L84189	u498	m30	WILL	Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
L84188	u498	m30	WILL	Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
L84187	u492	m30	EDWARD	You think I'm fake.
L84186	u498	m30	WILL	You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
L84185	u492	m30	EDWARD	I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
L84184	u498	m30	WILL	I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
L84183	u492	m30	EDWARD	What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
L84182	u498	m30	WILL	The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
L84181	u492	m30	EDWARD	"Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is..."""
L84180	u498	m30	WILL	I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
L84179	u492	m30	EDWARD	What?
L84178	u498	m30	WILL	Dad!
L84177	u492	m30	EDWARD	Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
L84176	u498	m30	WILL	Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
L84173	u498	m30	WILL	Can we talk?
L84172	u492	m30	EDWARD	Son?
L84171	u498	m30	WILL	Dad?
L84170	u492	m30	EDWARD	But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
L84168	u492	m30	EDWARD	I think someone hasn't.
L84167	u498	m30	WILL	The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
L84166	u498	m30	WILL	Yes.
L84165	u492	m30	EDWARD	Did I ever tell you about how...
L83962	u492	m30	EDWARD	Oh, so you know.
L83961	u498	m30	WILL	Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
L83960	u492	m30	EDWARD	It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
L83959	u498	m30	WILL	Why not religion, Dad?
L83814	u492	m30	EDWARD	I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
L83813	u498	m30	WILL	I thought you weren't dying.
L83811	u498	m30	WILL	I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
L83810	u492	m30	EDWARD	You know where the chemicals are?
L83809	u498	m30	WILL	I will.
L83808	u492	m30	EDWARD	Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
L83807	u498	m30	WILL	I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
L83806	u492	m30	EDWARD	You mean, while I'm here.
L83805	u498	m30	WILL	Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
L83803	u498	m30	WILL	You're right.
L83802	u492	m30	EDWARD	There's a lot you don't know about me.
L83801	u498	m30	WILL	When did you ever work in an office?
L83800	u492	m30	EDWARD	True story.
L83799	u498	m30	WILL	Really.
L83798	u492	m30	EDWARD	You owe me three-fifty.
L83797	u498	m30	WILL	What did he say?
L83796	u492	m30	EDWARD	And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
L83795	u498	m30	WILL	Okay.
L83794	u492	m30	EDWARD	There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
L83793	u492	m30	EDWARD	Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
L83792	u498	m30	WILL	So how does it happen?
L83791	u492	m30	EDWARD	I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
L83790	u498	m30	WILL	No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
L83789	u492	m30	EDWARD	She was a witch.
L83788	u498	m30	WILL	The Old Lady by the swamp.
L83787	u492	m30	EDWARD	Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
L83786	u498	m30	WILL	Really.
L83785	u492	m30	EDWARD	People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
L83783	u492	m30	EDWARD	You learned from the best.
L83782	u498	m30	WILL	You think I'm up for it?
L83781	u492	m30	EDWARD	No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
L83780	u498	m30	WILL	Did you do any of that?
L83779	u492	m30	EDWARD	Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
L83778	u498	m30	WILL	Am I?
L83777	u492	m30	EDWARD	You --  -- are in for a surprise.
L83705	u498	m30	WILL	I'm not scared.
L83704	u492	m30	EDWARD	Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
L83703	u498	m30	WILL	The one about the witch.
L83675	u498	m30	WILL	No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
L83674	u492	m30	EDWARD	Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
L83673	u498	m30	WILL	Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
L83672	u492	m30	EDWARD	Jesus Christ.
L83671	u498	m30	WILL	I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
L83670	u492	m30	EDWARD	What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
L83659	u498	m30	WILL	Make him stop.
L83658	u492	m30	EDWARD	You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
L84239	u497	m30	SANDRA	I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
L84238	u492	m30	EDWARD	I was drying out.
L84104	u492	m30	EDWARD	Go out with me.
L84103	u497	m30	SANDRA	How can I convince you to stop?
L84086	u492	m30	EDWARD	I have the rest of my life to find out.
L84085	u497	m30	SANDRA	You don't even know me.
L84084	u492	m30	EDWARD	I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
L84083	u497	m30	SANDRA	How did you get so many?
L84082	u492	m30	EDWARD	They're your favorite flower.
L84081	u497	m30	SANDRA	Daffodils?
L84074	u497	m30	SANDRA	But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
L84073	u492	m30	EDWARD	Oh.
L84071	u492	m30	EDWARD	Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
L84070	u497	m30	SANDRA	I'm sorry.
L84229	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
L84228	u492	m30	EDWARD	'Fraid so.
L84227	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	This is it? The whole vault.
L84218	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I'm robbing this place.
L84217	u492	m30	EDWARD	So what are you up to now?
L84216	u492	m30	EDWARD	That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
L84215	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
L84214	u492	m30	EDWARD	I don't believe it!
L84213	u492	m30	EDWARD	I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
L84212	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	It's me. Norther Winslow.
L83915	u492	m30	EDWARD	You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
L83914	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I can't imagine any place better than here.
L83913	u492	m30	EDWARD	Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
L83912	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	This is why you don't show work in progress.
L83910	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
L83909	u492	m30	EDWARD	Really.
L83908	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
L83903	u496	m30	NORTHER WINSLOW	There is no softer ground than town.
L83902	u492	m30	EDWARD	Wait! I need those!
L84326	u493	m30	JENNY	Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
L84325	u498	m30	WILL	You didn't become crazy.
L84324	u493	m30	JENNY	No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
L84323	u498	m30	WILL	Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
L84267	u498	m30	WILL	My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
L84266	u493	m30	JENNY	Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
L84265	u498	m30	WILL	Because he's dying.
L84264	u493	m30	JENNY	Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
L84263	u498	m30	WILL	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
L84262	u493	m30	JENNY	Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
L84261	u498	m30	WILL	Were you and my father having an affair?
L84260	u493	m30	JENNY	This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
L84259	u498	m30	WILL	How did you know my father?
L84255	u493	m30	JENNY	I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
L84254	u498	m30	WILL	Are you Jenny Hill?
L84253	u493	m30	JENNY	I wasn't expecting you.
L84252	u498	m30	WILL	Hello.
L84251	u493	m30	JENNY	Oh. Oh.
L84351	u497	m30	SANDRA	I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
L84350	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I do.
L84349	u497	m30	SANDRA	Do you like it, being pregnant?
L84348	u497	m30	SANDRA	I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
L84347	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
L84200	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I need to lie down for a bit.
L84199	u497	m30	SANDRA	I'm going to check on him.
L84175	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'll help you.
L84174	u497	m30	SANDRA	I'm going to get started on dishes.
L83955	u497	m30	SANDRA	We'll have to pick up a copy.
L83954	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
L83758	u497	m30	SANDRA	Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
L83757	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Yes.
L83756	u497	m30	SANDRA	Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
L84336	u498	m30	WILL	Is he going to be okay?
L84335	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
L84334	u498	m30	WILL	What happened?
L84164	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
L84163	u498	m30	WILL	I need you on my side.
L84162	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You're not.
L84161	u498	m30	WILL	Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
L84160	u498	m30	WILL	"What is ""true?"" I've never heard my father say a single true thing."
L84159	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	But it's not true.
L84158	u498	m30	WILL	You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
L84157	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Do you love him?
L84156	u498	m30	WILL	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
L84155	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Do you love your father?
L84154	u498	m30	WILL	Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
L84153	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	Mmm, what?
L84152	u498	m30	WILL	Mmm.
L84151	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	But it's romantic.
L84150	u498	m30	WILL	That's because most of it never happened.
L84149	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
L84148	u498	m30	WILL	They met at Auburn.
L84147	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You never told me how your parents met.
L84146	u498	m30	WILL	Did you?
L84145	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I talked with your father last night.
L83701	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'm going with you.
L83700	u498	m30	WILL	You don't have to.
L83699	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	I'm going with you.
L83698	u498	m30	WILL	Probably tonight.
L83697	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	You need to go.
L83696	u498	m30	WILL	It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
L83695	u494	m30	JOSEPHINE	It's bad.
L84346	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes. Thank you.
L84345	u498	m30	WILL	Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
L84341	u497	m30	SANDRA	That's okay?
L84340	u498	m30	WILL	I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
L84339	u497	m30	SANDRA	I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
L84249	u497	m30	SANDRA	Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
L84248	u498	m30	WILL	So you never bought any land.
L84247	u497	m30	SANDRA	I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
L84246	u498	m30	WILL	Did you and Dad have any other property?
L84245	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes?
L84244	u498	m30	WILL	Mom?
L84243	u497	m30	SANDRA	He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
L84242	u498	m30	WILL	Is he awake?
L84198	u497	m30	SANDRA	Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
L84197	u498	m30	WILL	That really happened?
L83982	u497	m30	SANDRA	Do you know who that is?
L83981	u498	m30	WILL	No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
L83980	u497	m30	SANDRA	Was she one of your teachers?
L83979	u498	m30	WILL	Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
L83978	u497	m30	SANDRA	Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
L83977	u497	m30	SANDRA	Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
L83976	u498	m30	WILL	But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
L83975	u497	m30	SANDRA	I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
L83974	u498	m30	WILL	True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
L83973	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
L83972	u498	m30	WILL	Josephine and I have a lot in common.
L83971	u497	m30	SANDRA	No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
L83970	u498	m30	WILL	Yes. But that's a different...
L83969	u497	m30	SANDRA	Would you say you understand Josephine?
L83968	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
L83967	u498	m30	WILL	How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
L83966	u497	m30	SANDRA	Yes.
L83965	u498	m30	WILL	What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
L83964	u497	m30	SANDRA	Of course.
L83963	u498	m30	WILL	Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
L83953	u497	m30	SANDRA	Really! That's wonderful.
L83952	u498	m30	WILL	I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
L83764	u497	m30	SANDRA	You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
L83763	u498	m30	WILL	How much time does he have left?
L83762	u497	m30	SANDRA	He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
L83761	u498	m30	WILL	How is he?
L83760	u497	m30	SANDRA	He's up with your father.
L83759	u498	m30	WILL	Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
L83751	u497	m30	SANDRA	You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
L83750	u498	m30	WILL	We rented a car.
L83749	u497	m30	SANDRA	Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
L83748	u498	m30	WILL	We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
L83747	u497	m30	SANDRA	How did you get here?
L188218	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
L188217	u839	m54	AUD	It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
L188210	u839	m54	AUD	But, Father, it IS!
L188209	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	It's all right! It isn't happening!
L187976	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
L187975	u839	m54	AUD	It's your fantasy...
L187974	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
L187973	u839	m54	AUD	There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
L187972	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
L187971	u839	m54	AUD	It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
L187967	u839	m54	AUD	You're losing your temper!
L187966	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
L187964	u839	m54	AUD	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
L187963	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well... where is he?
L187959	u839	m54	AUD	There IS no one.
L187958	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
L187957	u839	m54	AUD	Who, Father?
L187956	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Right! Where is he?
L187952	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Open up! I know you're in there!
L187951	u839	m54	AUD	Ah! It's my father!
L187950	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Open up! I know you're in there!
L188310	u840	m54	ERIK	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
L188309	u839	m54	AUD	I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
L188308	u840	m54	ERIK	No... no...
L188307	u839	m54	AUD	Then I shall come too.
L188304	u839	m54	AUD	No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
L188303	u840	m54	ERIK	There is something I must ask the Gods...
L188302	u839	m54	AUD	Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
L188301	u840	m54	ERIK	Not quite...
L188300	u839	m54	AUD	Erik! You've done what you came to do!
L188298	u840	m54	ERIK	The second note to wake the Gods...
L188297	u839	m54	AUD	The second note.
L188282	u839	m54	AUD	Then let go!
L188281	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes -- I believe you do.
L188280	u839	m54	AUD	You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
L188279	u840	m54	ERIK	I... but I...
L188278	u839	m54	AUD	Do you believe I love you?
L188277	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course.
L188276	u839	m54	AUD	YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
L188272	u840	m54	ERIK	I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
L188271	u839	m54	AUD	No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
L188258	u840	m54	ERIK	That's right!
L188257	u839	m54	AUD	No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
L188052	u839	m54	AUD	No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
L188051	u840	m54	ERIK	And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
L188049	u840	m54	ERIK	Goodbye, Aud...
L188048	u839	m54	AUD	But you don't realize....
L188047	u840	m54	ERIK	No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
L188046	u839	m54	AUD	Erik. You don't understand.
L188045	u840	m54	ERIK	I'll bring it back.
L188044	u839	m54	AUD	No!
L188041	u839	m54	AUD	Why?
L188040	u840	m54	ERIK	Where's the Cloak Invisible?
L188039	u839	m54	AUD	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
L188038	u840	m54	ERIK	Just give me a hand.
L187989	u839	m54	AUD	But, Erik...
L187988	u840	m54	ERIK	Halfdan the Black.
L187987	u839	m54	AUD	Who?
L187986	u840	m54	ERIK	We mustn't let him land!
L187984	u840	m54	ERIK	And the week before that?
L187983	u839	m54	AUD	You're as bad as my father.
L187982	u840	m54	ERIK	Five this week; how many the week before?
L187981	u839	m54	AUD	That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
L187980	u840	m54	ERIK	And I thought you said it was something special...
L187979	u839	m54	AUD	Oh, for goodness' sake!
L187978	u840	m54	ERIK	The fifth one this week!
L187977	u839	m54	AUD	The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
L187949	u840	m54	ERIK	I've never been to bed with anybody!
L187948	u839	m54	AUD	I've never LOVED anybody!
L187947	u840	m54	ERIK	You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
L187946	u839	m54	AUD	Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
L187945	u840	m54	ERIK	We never went to bed together.
L187944	u839	m54	AUD	But you LOVED her all the same...
L187943	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
L187942	u839	m54	AUD	What was she like?
L187941	u840	m54	ERIK	It was different...
L187940	u839	m54	AUD	What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
L187939	u840	m54	ERIK	HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
L187938	u839	m54	AUD	No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
L187937	u840	m54	ERIK	You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
L187936	u839	m54	AUD	No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
L187935	u840	m54	ERIK	"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"
L187934	u839	m54	AUD	Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
L187853	u839	m54	AUD	But surely you know...?
L187852	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes.
L187851	u839	m54	AUD	WHY?
L187848	u839	m54	AUD	Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
L187847	u840	m54	ERIK	What?
L187846	u839	m54	AUD	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
L187845	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter?
L187843	u840	m54	ERIK	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
L187842	u839	m54	AUD	Those things in your hands.
L187841	u840	m54	ERIK	What are what?
L187840	u839	m54	AUD	Please! Please! What are those?
L187836	u839	m54	AUD	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
L187835	u840	m54	ERIK	"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"
L187834	u839	m54	AUD	Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
L187833	u840	m54	ERIK	WELCOME?
L187832	u839	m54	AUD	I said welcome.
L187831	u840	m54	ERIK	WHAT did you say?
L188245	u851	m54	LOKI	SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
L188244	u840	m54	ERIK	We blew the Horn Resounding.
L188243	u851	m54	LOKI	How do we know this is the way?
L188122	u851	m54	LOKI	What d'you mean?
L188121	u840	m54	ERIK	But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
L188118	u851	m54	LOKI	It was my master Keitel's idea.
L188117	u840	m54	ERIK	But --
L188115	u851	m54	LOKI	Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
L188114	u840	m54	ERIK	LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
L187468	u841	m54	FREYA	That I cannot tell you.
L187467	u840	m54	ERIK	And will the dead ever return, Freya?
L187464	u840	m54	ERIK	I will go and wake them up!
L187463	u841	m54	FREYA	The Gods are asleep, Erik.
L187462	u840	m54	ERIK	Is there nothing men can do?
L187458	u841	m54	FREYA	The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
L187457	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
L187456	u841	m54	FREYA	But have you ever seen it? Think back...
L187455	u840	m54	ERIK	The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
L187454	u841	m54	FREYA	Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
L187452	u841	m54	FREYA	Is it summer or winter, Erik?
L187451	u840	m54	ERIK	It is day, of course, Freya.
L187450	u841	m54	FREYA	Is it night or day, Erik?
L187449	u840	m54	ERIK	I see the world.
L187448	u841	m54	FREYA	What do you see, Erik?
L187445	u841	m54	FREYA	They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
L187444	u840	m54	ERIK	I shouldn't have come.
L187443	u841	m54	FREYA	"Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the ""Viking""?"
L188187	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	The important thing is not to panic.
L188186	u840	m54	ERIK	But it IS! Look!
L188140	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
L188139	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes... oh, yes...
L188138	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
L188137	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
L188136	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Is there something the matter with it?
L188011	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
L188010	u840	m54	ERIK	You don't know Halfdan the Black.
L188009	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
L188008	u840	m54	ERIK	He wants to kill US!
L188007	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Don't talk nonsense.
L188006	u840	m54	ERIK	Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
L188005	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Why?
L188004	u840	m54	ERIK	He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
L188001	u840	m54	ERIK	"They'll be more than ""hurt"" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!"
L188000	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
L187997	u840	m54	ERIK	You've got to let me go!
L187996	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
L187932	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes?
L187931	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	I'll tell you what...
L187928	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
L187927	u840	m54	ERIK	The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
L187926	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well, how d'you think I feel?
L187925	u840	m54	ERIK	Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
L187924	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
L187923	u840	m54	ERIK	No.
L187922	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
L187921	u840	m54	ERIK	No, no... It was very... er, nice.
L187920	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	We're just not a very musical nation...
L187901	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	"Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes ""TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"""
L187900	u840	m54	ERIK	No. 
L187899	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
L187898	u840	m54	ERIK	Really.
L187897	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	REALLY?
L187896	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
L187893	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	You're just saying that.
L187892	u840	m54	ERIK	Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
L187889	u840	m54	ERIK	No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
L187888	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	But you don't want to hear it.
L187887	u840	m54	ERIK	I'm sure it's lovely.
L187886	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	A lot of people like our singing.
L187885	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
L187884	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
L187883	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
L187882	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
L187881	u840	m54	ERIK	That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
L187880	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Would you like us to sing to you?
L187869	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well... isn't it great?
L187868	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
L187867	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
L187866	u840	m54	ERIK	How?
L187858	u849	m54	KING ARNULF	The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
L187857	u840	m54	ERIK	No... we don't...
L188390	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't know! I just did!
L188389	u846	m54	HELGA	Why should you care?
L188341	u840	m54	ERIK	Odin!
L188340	u846	m54	HELGA	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
L188339	u840	m54	ERIK	Is THAT Odin?
L188332	u840	m54	ERIK	Well... no...
L188331	u846	m54	HELGA	Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
L188330	u840	m54	ERIK	I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
L188329	u846	m54	HELGA	What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
L188328	u840	m54	ERIK	Why?
L188327	u846	m54	HELGA	What a stupid idea.
L188326	u840	m54	ERIK	I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
L187409	u840	m54	ERIK	Tell me your name?
L187408	u846	m54	HELGA	Why... should YOU care?
L187407	u840	m54	ERIK	Why should you care?
L187406	u846	m54	HELGA	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
L187405	u840	m54	ERIK	You told them I raped you -- why?
L187404	u846	m54	HELGA	Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
L187403	u840	m54	ERIK	I didn't mean to!
L187402	u846	m54	HELGA	Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
L187393	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh, thanks.
L187392	u846	m54	HELGA	Aaagh! Rape!
L187391	u840	m54	ERIK	Louder.
L187390	u846	m54	HELGA	Ah.
L187389	u840	m54	ERIK	Scream.
L187388	u846	m54	HELGA	And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
L187387	u840	m54	ERIK	I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
L187386	u846	m54	HELGA	Well you started it.
L187385	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
L187384	u846	m54	HELGA	But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
L187383	u840	m54	ERIK	To pay for the next expedition, of course.
L187382	u846	m54	HELGA	Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
L187381	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
L187380	u846	m54	HELGA	What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
L187379	u840	m54	ERIK	Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
L187378	u846	m54	HELGA	You DON'T like it, do you?
L187377	u840	m54	ERIK	About NOT raping you...
L187376	u846	m54	HELGA	About raping me?
L187375	u840	m54	ERIK	I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
L187374	u846	m54	HELGA	What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
L187373	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
L187372	u846	m54	HELGA	What?
L187371	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't suppose... no...
L187370	u846	m54	HELGA	Oh, get it over with.
L187369	u840	m54	ERIK	No. It isn't rape then, is it?
L187368	u846	m54	HELGA	What -- rape?
L187367	u840	m54	ERIK	No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
L187366	u846	m54	HELGA	You don't love ME.
L187365	u840	m54	ERIK	Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
L187363	u840	m54	ERIK	Sh!
L187362	u846	m54	HELGA	It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
L187361	u840	m54	ERIK	Shut up.
L187360	u846	m54	HELGA	What about the raping?
L187359	u840	m54	ERIK	Yes.
L187358	u846	m54	HELGA	Looting and pillaging, eh?
L187357	u840	m54	ERIK	Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
L187356	u846	m54	HELGA	Have you done this sort of thing before?
L188035	u856	m54	THORFINN	Don't you FEEL it?
L188034	u840	m54	ERIK	It's not magic! It's just a trick!
L188028	u856	m54	THORFINN	I know. I know.
L188027	u840	m54	ERIK	But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
L188018	u856	m54	THORFINN	He wants to KILL us.
L188017	u840	m54	ERIK	I know!
L188016	u856	m54	THORFINN	Halfdan the Black's here!
L187860	u840	m54	ERIK	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
L187859	u856	m54	THORFINN	That's terrible!
L187828	u856	m54	THORFINN	"You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make ""friends""."
L187827	u840	m54	ERIK	What's wrong with making friends?
L187822	u840	m54	ERIK	No.
L187821	u856	m54	THORFINN	Let's hack her to pieces.
L187805	u856	m54	THORFINN	Very deep... usually...
L187804	u840	m54	ERIK	How deep IS the ocean?
L187755	u840	m54	ERIK	It saved my father!
L187754	u856	m54	THORFINN	Erik! Row! What are you doing?
L187698	u840	m54	ERIK	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
L187697	u856	m54	THORFINN	It's Halfdan the Black!
L187694	u840	m54	ERIK	Come on, move it!
L187693	u856	m54	THORFINN	What are you talking about?
L187650	u840	m54	ERIK	He was lucky...  Sit there.
L187649	u856	m54	THORFINN	Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
L187505	u840	m54	ERIK	What?
L187504	u856	m54	THORFINN	But...
L187503	u840	m54	ERIK	But what?
L187497	u840	m54	ERIK	Find it... AND cross it!
L187496	u856	m54	THORFINN	FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
L187438	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	That's my boy!
L187437	u840	m54	ERIK	I... I... KILLED her...
L187436	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	So? What'd you do to her?
L187435	u840	m54	ERIK	She got me thinking...
L187434	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	It's always the women that start the trouble.
L187433	u840	m54	ERIK	I met this girl...
L187432	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	Who have you been talking to?
L187431	u840	m54	ERIK	Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
L187430	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	You talking piffle, son?
L187429	u840	m54	ERIK	We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
L187428	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	What?
L187427	u840	m54	ERIK	What's it all about?
L187426	u844	m54	GRANDFATHER	We're missing all the fun...
L187745	u847	m54	IVAR	Make your mind up.
L187744	u840	m54	ERIK	Faster!
L187739	u847	m54	IVAR	Sorry!
L187738	u840	m54	ERIK	Slower! In... Out...
L187733	u847	m54	IVAR	Sorry.
L187732	u840	m54	ERIK	Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
L187709	u840	m54	ERIK	Row! Row! Row!
L187708	u847	m54	IVAR	I want to die...  No, I don't!
L187646	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, you ARE!
L187645	u847	m54	IVAR	He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
L188169	u840	m54	ERIK	Look out!
L188168	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	What did he say?
L188066	u840	m54	ERIK	You'll see!
L188065	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	"What ""magic"" have you brought, Erik?"
L188031	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
L188030	u840	m54	ERIK	"What ""magic""?"
L188029	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	It's magic.
L187811	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	The sun! That's it!
L187810	u840	m54	ERIK	Look, the sky is blue...
L187752	u840	m54	ERIK	ROW!
L187751	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	SHUT UP!
L187656	u840	m54	ERIK	Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
L187655	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
L187642	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	You may need a real Berserk.
L187641	u840	m54	ERIK	What are YOU doing here?
L188357	u852	m54	ODIN	Look... Erik...
L188356	u840	m54	ERIK	But you're the Gods!
L188355	u852	m54	ODIN	Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
L188351	u840	m54	ERIK	Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
L188350	u852	m54	ODIN	So?
L188349	u840	m54	ERIK	Because... you're... you're the Gods....
L188348	u852	m54	ODIN	Why should WE care?
L188347	u840	m54	ERIK	Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
L188346	u852	m54	ODIN	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
L188345	u840	m54	ERIK	You must help us.
L188394	u853	m54	SNORRI	No! Arrgh!
L188393	u840	m54	ERIK	You'll be sucked down too!
L188392	u853	m54	SNORRI	I've got you!
L188391	u840	m54	ERIK	No! Let go, Snorri!
L188129	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... I feel a little... oh...
L188128	u853	m54	SNORRI	Weren't we supposed to?
L188060	u840	m54	ERIK	To the oars!
L188059	u853	m54	SNORRI	A magic dishcloth.
L187791	u853	m54	SNORRI	Like fish.
L187790	u840	m54	ERIK	Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
L187786	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, come on!
L187785	u853	m54	SNORRI	First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
L187760	u853	m54	SNORRI	Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
L187759	u840	m54	ERIK	Row!
L187658	u853	m54	SNORRI	Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
L187657	u840	m54	ERIK	That's better.
L187653	u853	m54	SNORRI	Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
L187652	u840	m54	ERIK	That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
L187651	u853	m54	SNORRI	You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
L187640	u853	m54	SNORRI	Trust me to get the missionary.
L187639	u840	m54	ERIK	Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
L187638	u853	m54	SNORRI	It's SO nice to feel wanted.
L187637	u840	m54	ERIK	Now stop it!
L187636	u853	m54	SNORRI	Thank you VERY much indeed.
L187509	u840	m54	ERIK	No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
L187508	u853	m54	SNORRI	You mean we'd be dead?
L187611	u843	m54	GRANDAD	No, don't say anything else!
L187610	u840	m54	ERIK	Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
L187609	u843	m54	GRANDAD	I think we should go...
L187604	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
L187603	u843	m54	GRANDAD	Just say something cheerful.
L187602	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter with them?
L187595	u840	m54	ERIK	Oh... er... yes...
L187594	u843	m54	GRANDAD	You need to say a bit more than that!
L187490	u840	m54	ERIK	Nobody gets killed.
L187489	u843	m54	GRANDAD	Who gets killed?
L187488	u840	m54	ERIK	There is another way.
L188247	u840	m54	ERIK	What are you talking about?
L188246	u848	m54	KEITEL	Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
L188058	u848	m54	KEITEL	What is it?
L188057	u840	m54	ERIK	So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
L187824	u840	m54	ERIK	How about making friends?
L187823	u848	m54	KEITEL	Well, what else do we do?
L187705	u848	m54	KEITEL	But...
L187704	u840	m54	ERIK	And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
L187701	u848	m54	KEITEL	But how could he know... unless...
L187700	u840	m54	ERIK	What do you think?
L187648	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter with Bjorn?
L187647	u848	m54	KEITEL	Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
L187613	u840	m54	ERIK	Keitel Blacksmith?
L187612	u848	m54	KEITEL	Wait, Erik!
L188306	u840	m54	ERIK	I have to go...
L188305	u854	m54	SVEN	I came to find my grandfather.
L188231	u854	m54	SVEN	Let me do something for myself for a change!
L188230	u840	m54	ERIK	Sven!
L188223	u854	m54	SVEN	Over the Edge of the World.
L188222	u840	m54	ERIK	We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
L187838	u840	m54	ERIK	Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
L187837	u854	m54	SVEN	Hy-Brasil?
L187818	u840	m54	ERIK	She MUST have a knife or something...
L187817	u854	m54	SVEN	She hasn't got any.
L187750	u854	m54	SVEN	DEATH!
L187749	u840	m54	ERIK	ROW!
L187644	u840	m54	ERIK	We haven't got a spare place.
L187643	u854	m54	SVEN	I AM one, Dad!
L187635	u854	m54	SVEN	I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
L187634	u840	m54	ERIK	Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
L187633	u854	m54	SVEN	Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
L187632	u840	m54	ERIK	It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
L187631	u854	m54	SVEN	Look, I bagged it last week.
L187627	u854	m54	SVEN	I was sitting there.
L187626	u840	m54	ERIK	Hey, you two! What's going on?
L187511	u840	m54	ERIK	I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
L187510	u854	m54	SVEN	But HOW?
L187507	u840	m54	ERIK	We'd be the first!
L187506	u854	m54	SVEN	Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
L187501	u840	m54	ERIK	What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
L187500	u854	m54	SVEN	Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
L187495	u840	m54	ERIK	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
L187494	u854	m54	SVEN	What are you talking about, Erik?
L187479	u854	m54	SVEN	I will join my grandfather there.
L187478	u840	m54	ERIK	And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
L187584	u842	m54	GIRL	Please.
L187583	u850	m54	LEIF	That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
L187581	u842	m54	GIRL	What d'you expect me to do?
L187580	u850	m54	LEIF	You will wait?
L187579	u842	m54	GIRL	Yeah... well...
L187578	u850	m54	LEIF	Bye... sorry...
L187577	u842	m54	GIRL	Bye, Leif.
L188075	u845	m54	HARALD	Well, where is he then?
L188074	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	He hasn't.
L188073	u845	m54	HARALD	Vanish into thin air?
L188072	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Do what?
L188071	u845	m54	HARALD	How did he do that?
L187798	u845	m54	HARALD	Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
L187797	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	What do we have to do?
L187796	u845	m54	HARALD	It can't do you any HARM...
L187735	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	The Dragon...
L187734	u845	m54	HARALD	What's all the panic about?
L187674	u853	m54	SNORRI	I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
L187673	u845	m54	HARALD	"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""
L187672	u853	m54	SNORRI	Your lord.
L187671	u845	m54	HARALD	You know, my son, our lord said...
L187592	u845	m54	HARALD	No, it is NOT.
L187591	u853	m54	SNORRI	Same thing, isn't it?
L187590	u845	m54	HARALD	Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
L187589	u853	m54	SNORRI	There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
L187588	u845	m54	HARALD	Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
L187587	u853	m54	SNORRI	You're wasting your time.
L187586	u845	m54	HARALD	I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
L187585	u853	m54	SNORRI	You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
L188403	u856	m54	THORFINN	Mum! Dad!
L188402	u847	m54	IVAR	Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
L188055	u856	m54	THORFINN	Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
L188054	u847	m54	IVAR	That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
L188053	u856	m54	THORFINN	And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
L188026	u847	m54	IVAR	That's it!
L188025	u856	m54	THORFINN	Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
L187690	u847	m54	IVAR	Bastard.
L187689	u856	m54	THORFINN	He used to puke in his sleep.
L187688	u847	m54	IVAR	Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
L187687	u856	m54	THORFINN	Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
L187686	u847	m54	IVAR	I know. I know.
L187685	u856	m54	THORFINN	I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
L187684	u847	m54	IVAR	How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
L187683	u856	m54	THORFINN	You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
L187682	u847	m54	IVAR	No, I'm not.
L187681	u856	m54	THORFINN	Are you all right?
L187784	u854	m54	SVEN	Hang on...
L187783	u848	m54	KEITEL	For your own sake... For the others... I...
L187782	u854	m54	SVEN	I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
L187781	u848	m54	KEITEL	I'm not worth risking your life for.
L187780	u854	m54	SVEN	What are you talking about?
L187779	u848	m54	KEITEL	Let me go, Sven.
L187778	u854	m54	SVEN	Got you!
L187777	u848	m54	KEITEL	Aaagh!
L188164	u853	m54	SNORRI	What have you got there?
L188163	u848	m54	KEITEL	Get away, Snorri.
L188162	u853	m54	SNORRI	What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
L188161	u848	m54	KEITEL	What?
L188157	u853	m54	SNORRI	Oh...
L188156	u848	m54	KEITEL	It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
L188155	u853	m54	SNORRI	Who's that?
L188096	u848	m54	KEITEL	I... I...
L188095	u853	m54	SNORRI	Well! Come on!
L188372	u848	m54	KEITEL	It's not my business any more!
L188371	u851	m54	LOKI	By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
L188370	u848	m54	KEITEL	Made by YOU, Loki!
L188256	u848	m54	KEITEL	Like you got rid of Snorri!
L188255	u851	m54	LOKI	I should have got rid of you long ago!
L188254	u851	m54	LOKI	You fool!
L188253	u848	m54	KEITEL	We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
L188252	u851	m54	LOKI	You've lost your mind.
L188251	u848	m54	KEITEL	No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
L188250	u851	m54	LOKI	Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
L188249	u848	m54	KEITEL	She knows it was our fault!
L188248	u851	m54	LOKI	Shut up!
L188200	u851	m54	LOKI	Help!
L188199	u848	m54	KEITEL	Help!
L188198	u848	m54	KEITEL	You'll drown us bo...
L188197	u851	m54	LOKI	Help!
L188196	u848	m54	KEITEL	Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
L188194	u851	m54	LOKI	I'm drowning! Help!
L188193	u848	m54	KEITEL	Relax!
L188192	u851	m54	LOKI	I can't swim! I can't swim!
L188149	u851	m54	LOKI	You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
L188148	u848	m54	KEITEL	YOU do it!
L188147	u851	m54	LOKI	Sh! Hurry!
L188144	u848	m54	KEITEL	How can we stops him now?
L188143	u851	m54	LOKI	Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
L188120	u848	m54	KEITEL	Well... I... I thought...
L188119	u851	m54	LOKI	Wasn't it, Keitel?
L187549	u851	m54	LOKI	You can't let Erik do THAT.
L187548	u848	m54	KEITEL	Together we stand!
L187547	u851	m54	LOKI	Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
L187546	u848	m54	KEITEL	The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
L187545	u851	m54	LOKI	That's right.
L187544	u848	m54	KEITEL	My brother blacksmiths!
L187543	u851	m54	LOKI	It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
L187542	u848	m54	KEITEL	The bottom falls out of the sword business!
L187541	u851	m54	LOKI	The Age of Ragnarok ends...
L187540	u848	m54	KEITEL	They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
L187539	u851	m54	LOKI	But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
L187538	u848	m54	KEITEL	Can't make enough axe-heads!
L187537	u848	m54	KEITEL	Can't make enough swords!
L187536	u851	m54	LOKI	If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
L187535	u851	m54	LOKI	"Yes yes... of course.... the ""Blacksmith's Code""..."
L187534	u848	m54	KEITEL	Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
L187533	u851	m54	LOKI	You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
L187532	u851	m54	LOKI	You could charge him what you like.
L187531	u848	m54	KEITEL	Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
L187530	u851	m54	LOKI	Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
L188367	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I hate you! I hate you!
L188366	u854	m54	SVEN	Dad!
L188365	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."
L188364	u854	m54	SVEN	Easy, Dad!
L188363	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	He drove me mad!
L188274	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Helpless...
L188273	u854	m54	SVEN	There is nothing we can do...
L188104	u854	m54	SVEN	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
L188103	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Well, go on! Go berserk!
L188091	u854	m54	SVEN	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
L188090	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
L187895	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Sh!
L187894	u854	m54	SVEN	Well, of course he is!
L187758	u854	m54	SVEN	DEATH TO DRAGONS!
L187757	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	HOLD it! HOLD it in!
L187748	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Stop it!
L187747	u854	m54	SVEN	KILL! KILL!
L187743	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
L187742	u854	m54	SVEN	I must KILL! Kill!
L187741	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	Not now, Sven...
L187740	u854	m54	SVEN	We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
L187573	u854	m54	SVEN	I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
L187572	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
L187571	u854	m54	SVEN	I must only let the red rage...
L187570	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
L187569	u854	m54	SVEN	But it's a responsibility...
L187568	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	So did my father and his father before him.
L187567	u854	m54	SVEN	So did your father...
L187566	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
L187565	u854	m54	SVEN	You went berserk...
L187564	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
L187563	u854	m54	SVEN	I know, Dad.
L187562	u855	m54	SVEN'S DAD	It's a tradition.
L188112	u854	m54	SVEN	Tell him I'm coming!
L188111	u856	m54	THORFINN	No... he's not... not... there...
L188110	u854	m54	SVEN	You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
L188109	u856	m54	THORFINN	I'm not frightened... of anything...
L188108	u854	m54	SVEN	Thorfinn! You can't die!
L187793	u856	m54	THORFINN	Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
L187792	u854	m54	SVEN	Shut up.
L187519	u856	m54	THORFINN	Me too.
L187518	u854	m54	SVEN	Well... I'm game.
L187513	u854	m54	SVEN	Neither am I.
L187512	u856	m54	THORFINN	Well I'M certainly not, either.
L187481	u854	m54	SVEN	You liar!
L187480	u856	m54	THORFINN	He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
L187561	u856	m54	THORFINN	I never do...
L187560	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
L187557	u856	m54	THORFINN	Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
L187556	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And keep your sword greased.
L187555	u856	m54	THORFINN	No, Mother.
L187554	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
L187553	u856	m54	THORFINN	Yes, Mum.
L187552	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And something to sharpen them with?
L187551	u856	m54	THORFINN	Yes, Mother.
L187550	u857	m54	THORFINN'S MUM	And you've got BOTH axes?
L203901	u890	m58	BEN	I like the sound of that.
L203900	u889	m58	ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
L203694	u889	m58	ALICIA	My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
L203693	u890	m58	BEN	Those yours too?
L203692	u890	m58	BEN	No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
L203691	u889	m58	ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
L203690	u890	m58	BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
L203689	u889	m58	ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
L203688	u890	m58	BEN	How'd you know it was me?
L203562	u890	m58	BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
L203561	u889	m58	ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
L203558	u890	m58	BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
L203557	u889	m58	ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
L203702	u889	m58	ALICIA	Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
L203701	u898	m58	THE THING	I mean...
L203700	u889	m58	ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
L203699	u898	m58	THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
L203697	u898	m58	THE THING	This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
L203696	u889	m58	ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
L203695	u898	m58	THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
L203830	u890	m58	BEN	Victor must've taken him.
L203829	u897	m58	SUE	Where is Reed?
L203647	u897	m58	SUE	No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
L203646	u890	m58	BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
L203645	u897	m58	SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
L203644	u890	m58	BEN	It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
L203643	u897	m58	SUE	He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
L203604	u897	m58	SUE	What did he do to the uniform?!
L203603	u890	m58	BEN	Oh, he did.
L203602	u897	m58	SUE	He didn't.
L203501	u890	m58	BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
L203500	u897	m58	SUE	The suit will stretch. You should try it --
L203499	u890	m58	BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
L203450	u890	m58	BEN	Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
L203449	u897	m58	SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
L203265	u890	m58	BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
L203264	u897	m58	SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
L203128	u890	m58	BEN	Is it safe?
L203127	u897	m58	SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
L203091	u897	m58	SUE	Victor did.
L203090	u890	m58	BEN	I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
L203073	u897	m58	SUE	I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
L203072	u890	m58	BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
L203798	u890	m58	BEN	And you can? Power it up?
L203797	u899	m58	VICTOR	"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
L203796	u899	m58	VICTOR	He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
L203795	u890	m58	BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
L203794	u899	m58	VICTOR	To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
L203793	u890	m58	BEN	What do you want, Vic?
L203790	u899	m58	VICTOR	Where do you think? With Sue.
L203789	u890	m58	BEN	What is this? Where's Reed?
L203788	u899	m58	VICTOR	Ben, come in.
L203738	u899	m58	VICTOR	Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
L203737	u890	m58	BEN	About me? How sweet.
L203736	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
L203735	u890	m58	BEN	What are you doing here?
L203546	u890	m58	BEN	I already got it. Everything I want.
L203545	u891	m58	DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
L203330	u890	m58	BEN	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
L203329	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
L203328	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.
L203327	u890	m58	BEN	"Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
L203326	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Ben?
L203324	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
L203323	u890	m58	BEN	Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
L203114	u891	m58	DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
L203113	u890	m58	BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
L203112	u891	m58	DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
L203111	u890	m58	BEN	I'll be watching over you.
L203898	u890	m58	BEN	Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
L203897	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
L203888	u890	m58	BEN	Got it, teach.
L203887	u895	m58	REED	Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
L203754	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
L203753	u890	m58	BEN	"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
L203751	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
L203750	u895	m58	REED	We're working as hard as we can --
L203749	u890	m58	BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
L203748	u895	m58	REED	Ben --
L203629	u895	m58	REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
L203628	u890	m58	BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
L203468	u895	m58	REED	O-kay. We'll skip that question.
L203467	u890	m58	BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
L203466	u895	m58	REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
L203465	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
L203464	u895	m58	REED	Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
L203448	u895	m58	REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
L203447	u890	m58	BEN	You got a chisel round here?
L203413	u890	m58	BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.
L203412	u895	m58	REED	We had a tough year.
L203368	u890	m58	BEN	Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
L203367	u895	m58	REED	Ben. Are you okay?
L203366	u890	m58	BEN	What the --!
L203270	u890	m58	BEN	I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
L203269	u895	m58	REED	Are you alright?
L203242	u890	m58	BEN	Well maybe you should date him.
L203241	u895	m58	REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
L203240	u890	m58	BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
L203239	u895	m58	REED	What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
L203238	u890	m58	BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
L203237	u895	m58	REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
L203236	u890	m58	BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
L203234	u895	m58	REED	I should have done more, run more tests --
L203233	u890	m58	BEN	Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
L203232	u895	m58	REED	I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
L203230	u890	m58	BEN	Solid.
L203229	u895	m58	REED	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
L203228	u890	m58	BEN	How long was I out?
L203164	u895	m58	REED	Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
L203163	u890	m58	BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
L203130	u890	m58	BEN	Should?
L203129	u895	m58	REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
L203110	u895	m58	REED	Victor's better at these things.
L203109	u890	m58	BEN	This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
L203108	u895	m58	REED	He's made a few changes.
L203107	u890	m58	BEN	Isn't that your speech?
L203087	u890	m58	BEN	This makes five.
L203086	u895	m58	REED	I had it at four.
L203085	u890	m58	BEN	Five times.
L203084	u895	m58	REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
L203083	u895	m58	REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.
L203082	u890	m58	BEN	They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
L203081	u895	m58	REED	Youthful high spirits.
L203080	u890	m58	BEN	No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
L203079	u895	m58	REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
L203078	u890	m58	BEN	Can't do it. I cannot do it.
L203066	u890	m58	BEN	I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
L203065	u895	m58	REED	We got what we wanted. That's enough.
L203064	u890	m58	BEN	Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
L203063	u895	m58	REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
L203062	u890	m58	BEN	He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
L203053	u895	m58	REED	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
L203052	u890	m58	BEN	What about his first born?
L203038	u895	m58	REED	Ben. This is business. Just work.
L203037	u890	m58	BEN	I can't take this.
L203022	u890	m58	BEN	You'd never know it.
L203021	u895	m58	REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
L203020	u895	m58	REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
L203019	u890	m58	BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
L203911	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
L203910	u890	m58	BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
L203828	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
L203827	u890	m58	BEN	The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
L203765	u890	m58	BEN	Go back to the drawing board.
L203764	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Hey! That's a prototype!
L203196	u890	m58	BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!
L203195	u893	m58	JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
L203194	u890	m58	BEN	Give me a mirror...
L203193	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
L203192	u890	m58	BEN	What's wrong with me?
L203191	u893	m58	JOHNNY	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
L203190	u890	m58	BEN	Reed?... Sue?
L203189	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
L203188	u890	m58	BEN	Where... where am I?
L203144	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.
L203143	u890	m58	BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
L203142	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
L203141	u890	m58	BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
L203140	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
L203139	u890	m58	BEN	'Course not. Strictly business.
L203138	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
L203122	u890	m58	BEN	Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
L203121	u893	m58	JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
L203116	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
L203115	u890	m58	BEN	What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
L203519	u899	m58	VICTOR	That's terrible news...
L203518	u892	m58	DOCTOR	But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
L203516	u892	m58	DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
L203515	u899	m58	VICTOR	What?
L203514	u892	m58	DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
L203513	u899	m58	VICTOR	"What do you mean ""complete""?"
L203512	u892	m58	DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
L203511	u899	m58	VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
L203510	u892	m58	DOCTOR	I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
L203509	u899	m58	VICTOR	And they're changing into...
L203508	u892	m58	DOCTOR	Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
L203251	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	No: You're ON FIRE!
L203250	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Not this again --
L203249	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	You're on fire!
L203248	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	Last one down springs for room service.
L203247	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I though we went over this.
L203246	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	Stay right. Left is trouble.
L203245	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Me like-y.
L203227	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
L203226	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
L203225	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
L203224	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
L203223	u893	m58	JOHNNY	So are you!
L203222	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	You're hot!
L203214	u893	m58	JOHNNY	"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --"
L203213	u896	m58	SEXY NURSE	And where do we think we're going?
L203882	u895	m58	REED	Now.
L203881	u893	m58	JOHNNY	But all these people...
L203880	u895	m58	REED	Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
L203639	u895	m58	REED	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
L203638	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
L203637	u895	m58	REED	You need to control yourself and think before you --
L203550	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.
L203549	u895	m58	REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
L203503	u895	m58	REED	They're not costumes.
L203502	u893	m58	JOHNNY	He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
L203472	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
L203471	u895	m58	REED	What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
L203470	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
L203469	u895	m58	REED	Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
L203462	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
L203461	u895	m58	REED	Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
L203456	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I can go hotter!
L203455	u895	m58	REED	Back it down, Johnny!
L203426	u895	m58	REED	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
L203425	u893	m58	JOHNNY	This place is deluxe. You got cable?
L203424	u895	m58	REED	We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
L203415	u895	m58	REED	Oh, it is.
L203414	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
L203393	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
L203392	u895	m58	REED	Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
L203360	u895	m58	REED	You've been working out.
L203359	u893	m58	JOHNNY	This is wrong in so many ways.
L203304	u895	m58	REED	Ben, are you there?
L203303	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
L203295	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
L203294	u895	m58	REED	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
L203293	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Now what is up with that?
L203186	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Ben! Ben!
L203185	u895	m58	REED	He's not responsive --
L203179	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What about you?
L203178	u895	m58	REED	Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
L203840	u897	m58	SUE	But Johnny... you can't fly.
L203839	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
L203838	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing --
L203825	u897	m58	SUE	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
L203824	u893	m58	JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
L203772	u897	m58	SUE	As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
L203771	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
L203770	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
L203769	u893	m58	JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
L203768	u897	m58	SUE	"Is that what you call it? ""Real""?"
L203767	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
L203766	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny? Did you see Ben?
L203635	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Blockhead started it!
L203634	u897	m58	SUE	You two need a time-out.
L203627	u897	m58	SUE	"You gave us names? What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
L203626	u893	m58	JOHNNY	You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
L203623	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Dude. That's my sister.
L203622	u897	m58	SUE	I'm driving.
L203610	u897	m58	SUE	Girl...?!
L203609	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
L203460	u897	m58	SUE	That's the temperature of the sun.
L203459	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Sweet.
L203458	u897	m58	SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
L203457	u893	m58	JOHNNY	You're really cramping my style here.
L203423	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
L203422	u897	m58	SUE	Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
L203421	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
L203310	u897	m58	SUE	I think that thing is Ben.
L203309	u893	m58	JOHNNY	What is that thing?
L203302	u893	m58	JOHNNY	"Okay, ""mom."""
L203301	u897	m58	SUE	Stop it.
L203300	u897	m58	SUE	Johnny.
L203299	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
L203297	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Please tell me you go silent too.
L203296	u897	m58	SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
L203093	u893	m58	JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203092	u897	m58	SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L203336	u894	m58	LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
L203335	u899	m58	VICTOR	Front page?
L203334	u894	m58	LEONARD	Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L203333	u899	m58	VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
L203263	u899	m58	VICTOR	"That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not mine."""
L203262	u894	m58	LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
L203261	u899	m58	VICTOR	Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
L203260	u894	m58	LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L203259	u899	m58	VICTOR	And that's a good thing?
L203258	u894	m58	LEONARD	"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
L203257	u899	m58	VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L203256	u894	m58	LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L203255	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L203254	u894	m58	LEONARD	Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L203253	u899	m58	VICTOR	How's the IPO?
L203126	u894	m58	LEONARD	Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
L203125	u899	m58	VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
L203104	u899	m58	VICTOR	History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203103	u894	m58	LEONARD	Then what is it?
L203102	u899	m58	VICTOR	It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
L203101	u894	m58	LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203100	u899	m58	VICTOR	Showtime.
L203099	u894	m58	LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
L203061	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203060	u894	m58	LEONARD	And if he's not...?
L203059	u899	m58	VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L203904	u897	m58	SUE	A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
L203903	u895	m58	REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
L203885	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203884	u895	m58	REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L203779	u897	m58	SUE	You need a doctor.
L203778	u895	m58	REED	The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
L203777	u897	m58	SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L203776	u895	m58	REED	I can... make it work.
L203726	u897	m58	SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L203725	u895	m58	REED	Why didn't you say something?
L203724	u897	m58	SUE	When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L203723	u897	m58	SUE	I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
L203722	u895	m58	REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L203719	u897	m58	SUE	I gave him twenty.
L203718	u895	m58	REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L203717	u897	m58	SUE	Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L203716	u895	m58	REED	You were?
L203715	u897	m58	SUE	Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
L203714	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
L203713	u895	m58	REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L203682	u895	m58	REED	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L203681	u897	m58	SUE	Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
L203680	u895	m58	REED	Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
L203679	u897	m58	SUE	Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
L203678	u895	m58	REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L203677	u897	m58	SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L203596	u895	m58	REED	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
L203595	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. How close are we to a cure?
L203531	u895	m58	REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
L203530	u897	m58	SUE	And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
L203529	u895	m58	REED	Of course. Of course.
L203528	u897	m58	SUE	But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
L203527	u895	m58	REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L203526	u897	m58	SUE	And reverse the mutations --
L203525	u895	m58	REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L203524	u895	m58	REED	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L203523	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing?
L203494	u897	m58	SUE	No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L203493	u895	m58	REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
L203492	u897	m58	SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L203491	u895	m58	REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
L203490	u897	m58	SUE	Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L203489	u895	m58	REED	No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
L203488	u897	m58	SUE	Are you kidding?
L203487	u895	m58	REED	I mean, you broke up with me, right?
L203486	u895	m58	REED	What in the world would give me that idea?
L203485	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L203483	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L203482	u895	m58	REED	Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
L203481	u897	m58	SUE	Anger. Rage. Frustration.
L203480	u895	m58	REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L203479	u897	m58	SUE	Excuse me?
L203478	u895	m58	REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L203474	u897	m58	SUE	What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L203473	u895	m58	REED	"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge."
L203420	u897	m58	SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...
L203419	u895	m58	REED	That's what we're here to find out.
L203418	u897	m58	SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L203358	u897	m58	SUE	What...?  Oh.
L203357	u895	m58	REED	Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
L203355	u895	m58	REED	We need to get past them.
L203354	u897	m58	SUE	What?
L203292	u895	m58	REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
L203291	u897	m58	SUE	It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
L203289	u895	m58	REED	Sue... look at your hands.
L203288	u897	m58	SUE	What? What do you mean you --
L203287	u895	m58	REED	Uh, Sue...? I can't.
L203282	u897	m58	SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
L203281	u895	m58	REED	For science.
L203280	u895	m58	REED	Passion.
L203279	u897	m58	SUE	Which was?
L203278	u895	m58	REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
L203277	u897	m58	SUE	You're happy for me and Victor.
L203275	u897	m58	SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
L203274	u895	m58	REED	That's good. That's uh... good.
L203273	u897	m58	SUE	Yes, thanks.
L203272	u895	m58	REED	Feeling better?
L203096	u897	m58	SUE	Great minds think alike.
L203095	u895	m58	REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
L203077	u897	m58	SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
L203076	u895	m58	REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
L203075	u897	m58	SUE	It's been changed.
L203074	u895	m58	REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
L203071	u897	m58	SUE	Right. That's exactly what I meant.
L203070	u895	m58	REED	Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
L203069	u897	m58	SUE	I was talking about us. Working together.
L203068	u895	m58	REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
L203045	u897	m58	SUE	Never better.
L203044	u895	m58	REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
L203670	u899	m58	VICTOR	Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
L203669	u895	m58	REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
L203668	u899	m58	VICTOR	What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L203667	u895	m58	REED	What are you doing here?
L203443	u899	m58	VICTOR	I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
L203442	u895	m58	REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L203441	u899	m58	VICTOR	Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
L203440	u895	m58	REED	I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L203439	u899	m58	VICTOR	Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
L203436	u895	m58	REED	Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L203435	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L203316	u895	m58	REED	He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
L203315	u899	m58	VICTOR	Ben did this?
L203314	u895	m58	REED	Ben did this.
L203313	u899	m58	VICTOR	Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
L203172	u899	m58	VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L203171	u895	m58	REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
L203168	u899	m58	VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.
L203167	u895	m58	REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
L203161	u899	m58	VICTOR	So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
L203160	u895	m58	REED	Ben's still out there --
L203159	u899	m58	VICTOR	Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
L203158	u895	m58	REED	We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
L203137	u895	m58	REED	Sure.
L203136	u899	m58	VICTOR	Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203058	u895	m58	REED	Hilarious.
L203057	u899	m58	VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203051	u899	m58	VICTOR	The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
L203050	u895	m58	REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203047	u895	m58	REED	Not at all.
L203046	u899	m58	VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203034	u895	m58	REED	You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
L203033	u899	m58	VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L203577	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
L203576	u899	m58	VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
L203575	u897	m58	SUE	Please don't make this personal --
L203574	u899	m58	VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
L203573	u897	m58	SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
L203572	u899	m58	VICTOR	Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L203571	u897	m58	SUE	He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L203569	u899	m58	VICTOR	Susan. What are you doing?
L203568	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L203567	u899	m58	VICTOR	It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
L203566	u897	m58	SUE	You said it was urgent.
L203431	u899	m58	VICTOR	Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
L203430	u897	m58	SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L203429	u899	m58	VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
L203428	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, your scar --
L203319	u899	m58	VICTOR	Just find him.
L203318	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
L203312	u897	m58	SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?
L203311	u899	m58	VICTOR	What's going on?
L203175	u897	m58	SUE	You can't leave them out there.
L203174	u899	m58	VICTOR	Raising the shields.
L203173	u897	m58	SUE	What are you doing?
L203155	u899	m58	VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L203154	u897	m58	SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L203153	u899	m58	VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L203152	u897	m58	SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L203147	u899	m58	VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L203146	u897	m58	SUE	I understand the business reasons.
L203145	u899	m58	VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
L203041	u899	m58	VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
L203040	u897	m58	SUE	It's just business.
L203745	u898	m58	THE THING	Skeptical...?
L203744	u899	m58	VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
L203743	u898	m58	THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
L203742	u899	m58	VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
L203741	u898	m58	THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
L203740	u899	m58	VICTOR	I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
L203739	u898	m58	THE THING	'Scuse me.
L208900	u920	m60	DUKE	Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
L208899	u918	m60	CLERK	What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
L208898	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
L208897	u918	m60	CLERK	Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
L208896	u920	m60	DUKE	Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
L208895	u918	m60	CLERK	Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
L208894	u920	m60	DUKE	Crying? Why was she crying?
L208893	u918	m60	CLERK	The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
L208892	u920	m60	DUKE	Tell me. What do you want?
L208891	u918	m60	CLERK	Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
L208890	u920	m60	DUKE	IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
L208889	u918	m60	CLERK	Killed?
L208888	u920	m60	DUKE	WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
L208887	u918	m60	CLERK	Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
L208884	u920	m60	DUKE	Holy shit!
L208883	u918	m60	CLERK	"Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: ""Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."""
L208882	u920	m60	DUKE	What's the message? My light is blinking.
L208750	u920	m60	DUKE	Well, thank you.
L208749	u918	m60	CLERK	Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
L208748	u920	m60	DUKE	Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
L208747	u920	m60	DUKE	My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
L208746	u918	m60	CLERK	Certainly, Mr. Duke!
L208744	u918	m60	CLERK	"Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. ""Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."""
L208743	u920	m60	DUKE	Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
L208692	u920	m60	DUKE	Righto!
L208691	u918	m60	CLERK	Let's have lunch!
L208690	u920	m60	DUKE	Not for me.
L208689	u918	m60	CLERK	There's no hurry! The race is over!
L208688	u920	m60	DUKE	Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
L208687	u918	m60	CLERK	But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
L208686	u920	m60	DUKE	Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
L208685	u918	m60	CLERK	Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
L208684	u920	m60	DUKE	Awake? What do you mean?
L208683	u918	m60	CLERK	Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
L208682	u920	m60	DUKE	You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
L208681	u918	m60	CLERK	What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
L208680	u920	m60	DUKE	He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
L208679	u918	m60	CLERK	I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
L208678	u920	m60	DUKE	Yes... It makes sense.
L208677	u918	m60	CLERK	Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
L208877	u919	m60	DA	What?
L208876	u920	m60	DUKE	Dobermans don't talk.
L208875	u919	m60	DA	Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
L208872	u919	m60	DA	WHAT?
L208871	u920	m60	DUKE	Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
L208847	u920	m60	DUKE	Naked.
L208846	u919	m60	DA	Naked!?
L208836	u920	m60	DUKE	Not where we operate.
L208835	u919	m60	DA	Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
L208832	u919	m60	DA	Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
L208831	u920	m60	DUKE	They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
L208830	u919	m60	DA	You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
L208829	u920	m60	DUKE	Rum and ice, please.
L208870	u921	m60	GONZO	You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
L208869	u919	m60	DA	What do you mean by that?
L208868	u921	m60	GONZO	You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
L208867	u919	m60	DA	Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
L208857	u921	m60	GONZO	That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
L208856	u919	m60	DA	Really?
L208855	u921	m60	GONZO	He wanted the pineal gland.
L208854	u919	m60	DA	Naw! Not a major.
L208853	u921	m60	GONZO	We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
L208852	u919	m60	DA	A major!
L208851	u921	m60	GONZO	Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
L208841	u919	m60	DA	And nobody did anything?
L208840	u921	m60	GONZO	Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
L208839	u919	m60	DA	What happened? What did they do to her?
L208828	u919	m60	DA	Not down in my parts.
L208827	u921	m60	GONZO	They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
L208826	u919	m60	DA	Naw!
L208825	u921	m60	GONZO	You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
L208824	u919	m60	DA	I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
L209098	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
L209097	u925	m60	PROPRIETOR	This is my granddaughter...
L209096	u920	m60	DUKE	Oh, my God!...
L209095	u925	m60	PROPRIETOR	That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
L209094	u920	m60	DUKE	I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
L209093	u925	m60	PROPRIETOR	A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
L209092	u920	m60	DUKE	Las Vegas.
L209091	u925	m60	PROPRIETOR	Where ya comin' from, young man?
L208400	u920	m60	DUKE	Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
L208399	u923	m60	HITCHHIKER	Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
L208353	u920	m60	DUKE	Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
L208352	u923	m60	HITCHHIKER	What?
L208351	u920	m60	DUKE	I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
L208350	u923	m60	HITCHHIKER	Hell, no!
L208349	u920	m60	DUKE	I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
L209077	u921	m60	GONZO	Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
L209076	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
L209074	u921	m60	GONZO	Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
L209073	u920	m60	DUKE	Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
L209072	u921	m60	GONZO	No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
L209070	u920	m60	DUKE	Never missed a plane yet.
L209069	u921	m60	GONZO	The airport is over there!
L209066	u920	m60	DUKE	We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
L209065	u921	m60	GONZO	What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
L209059	u920	m60	DUKE	Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
L209058	u921	m60	GONZO	How much is the lemon meringue pie?
L209057	u920	m60	DUKE	I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
L209044	u921	m60	GONZO	Two glasses of ice water with ice.
L209043	u920	m60	DUKE	There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
L208999	u920	m60	DUKE	Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
L208998	u921	m60	GONZO	Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
L208983	u920	m60	DUKE	Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
L208982	u921	m60	GONZO	Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
L208976	u920	m60	DUKE	Do you think you can handle it?
L208975	u921	m60	GONZO	I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
L208974	u920	m60	DUKE	So do we, lady.
L208941	u920	m60	DUKE	FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
L208940	u921	m60	GONZO	Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
L208936	u921	m60	GONZO	...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
L208935	u920	m60	DUKE	Yes!
L208934	u921	m60	GONZO	...grow claws... bleeding warts.
L208933	u920	m60	DUKE	Right!
L208932	u921	m60	GONZO	Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
L208931	u921	m60	GONZO	Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
L208930	u920	m60	DUKE	Extract of pineal!
L208929	u921	m60	GONZO	Some of what?
L208928	u920	m60	DUKE	Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
L208925	u920	m60	DUKE	I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
L208924	u921	m60	GONZO	I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
L208923	u920	m60	DUKE	Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
L208922	u921	m60	GONZO	Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
L208921	u920	m60	DUKE	Where'd you get this?
L208920	u920	m60	DUKE	I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
L208917	u920	m60	DUKE	"I remember thinking, ""Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."""
L208916	u921	m60	GONZO	Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
L208915	u920	m60	DUKE	Adrenochrome...
L208914	u921	m60	GONZO	You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
L208913	u920	m60	DUKE	What is this?
L208912	u921	m60	GONZO	Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
L208911	u920	m60	DUKE	It's gone too far.
L208910	u921	m60	GONZO	OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
L208905	u921	m60	GONZO	She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
L208904	u920	m60	DUKE	Me?
L208903	u921	m60	GONZO	No, she's looking for you.
L208902	u920	m60	DUKE	Lucy is looking for you.
L208901	u921	m60	GONZO	Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
L208879	u920	m60	DUKE	They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
L208878	u921	m60	GONZO	Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
L208874	u920	m60	DUKE	We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
L208873	u921	m60	GONZO	Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
L208866	u921	m60	GONZO	Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
L208865	u920	m60	DUKE	What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
L208849	u920	m60	DUKE	They were all veterans.
L208848	u921	m60	GONZO	Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
L208845	u921	m60	GONZO	...and every one of them stacked naked...
L208844	u920	m60	DUKE	Like big lizards.
L208843	u921	m60	GONZO	They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
L208842	u920	m60	DUKE	What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
L208838	u920	m60	DUKE	Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
L208837	u921	m60	GONZO	Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
L208834	u920	m60	DUKE	Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
L208833	u921	m60	GONZO	Read the newspapers.
L208804	u920	m60	DUKE	Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
L208803	u921	m60	GONZO	This is a fucking nightmare.
L208802	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
L208801	u921	m60	GONZO	Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
L208800	u920	m60	DUKE	They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
L208799	u921	m60	GONZO	I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
L208794	u921	m60	GONZO	Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
L208793	u920	m60	DUKE	Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
L208792	u921	m60	GONZO	As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
L208791	u920	m60	DUKE	That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
L208790	u921	m60	GONZO	I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
L208787	u920	m60	DUKE	I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
L208786	u921	m60	GONZO	Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
L208784	u920	m60	DUKE	Us?
L208783	u921	m60	GONZO	It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
L208782	u920	m60	DUKE	What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
L208781	u921	m60	GONZO	We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
L208780	u920	m60	DUKE	The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
L208778	u920	m60	DUKE	You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
L208777	u921	m60	GONZO	NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
L208776	u920	m60	DUKE	In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
L208775	u921	m60	GONZO	You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
L208774	u920	m60	DUKE	I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
L208773	u921	m60	GONZO	NO! Stop talking like that.
L208772	u920	m60	DUKE	It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
L208771	u921	m60	GONZO	Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
L208770	u920	m60	DUKE	She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
L208769	u921	m60	GONZO	Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
L208768	u920	m60	DUKE	Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
L208767	u921	m60	GONZO	Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
L208766	u920	m60	DUKE	Lucy.
L208765	u921	m60	GONZO	Plans?
L208764	u920	m60	DUKE	WELL? What are your plans?
L208753	u921	m60	GONZO	"It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."""
L208752	u920	m60	DUKE	You degenerate pig!
L208724	u921	m60	GONZO	You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
L208723	u920	m60	DUKE	What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
L208722	u921	m60	GONZO	What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
L208721	u920	m60	DUKE	You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
L208645	u921	m60	GONZO	Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
L208644	u920	m60	DUKE	There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
L208643	u921	m60	GONZO	The cops?
L208642	u920	m60	DUKE	Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
L208641	u921	m60	GONZO	You cheap honky sonofabitch...
L208640	u920	m60	DUKE	Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
L208639	u921	m60	GONZO	You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
L208635	u920	m60	DUKE	Are you ready?
L208634	u921	m60	GONZO	Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
L208632	u921	m60	GONZO	Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
L208631	u920	m60	DUKE	Jesus.
L208630	u921	m60	GONZO	BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
L208629	u920	m60	DUKE	Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
L208628	u921	m60	GONZO	Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
L208627	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
L208626	u921	m60	GONZO	I want that fucking radio!
L208623	u921	m60	GONZO	Whatever's right.
L208622	u920	m60	DUKE	How about a check?
L208621	u921	m60	GONZO	Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
L208620	u920	m60	DUKE	OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
L208619	u921	m60	GONZO	I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
L208618	u920	m60	DUKE	You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
L208617	u921	m60	GONZO	"Jefferson Airplane. ""White Rabbit."" I want a rising sound."
L208616	u920	m60	DUKE	What tape?
L208615	u921	m60	GONZO	Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
L208614	u920	m60	DUKE	You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
L208607	u920	m60	DUKE	Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
L208606	u921	m60	GONZO	Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
L208591	u921	m60	GONZO	They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
L208590	u920	m60	DUKE	What limes?
L208589	u921	m60	GONZO	Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
L208588	u920	m60	DUKE	Where'd you get that knife?
L208587	u921	m60	GONZO	That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
L208586	u920	m60	DUKE	That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
L208585	u921	m60	GONZO	That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
L208584	u920	m60	DUKE	He told me he was turning in early...
L208583	u921	m60	GONZO	Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
L208582	u920	m60	DUKE	No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
L208581	u921	m60	GONZO	Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
L208580	u920	m60	DUKE	What for?
L208579	u921	m60	GONZO	Yeah... I thought we might need it...
L208573	u921	m60	GONZO	You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
L208572	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
L208571	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
L208570	u921	m60	GONZO	Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
L208569	u920	m60	DUKE	Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
L208568	u921	m60	GONZO	Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
L208564	u920	m60	DUKE	It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
L208563	u921	m60	GONZO	When does this thing stop?
L208560	u921	m60	GONZO	Do they pay you to screw that bear?
L208559	u920	m60	DUKE	OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
L208558	u921	m60	GONZO	I want to leave fast.
L208557	u920	m60	DUKE	That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
L208556	u921	m60	GONZO	Can we make it?
L208555	u920	m60	DUKE	OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
L208554	u921	m60	GONZO	No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
L208553	u920	m60	DUKE	Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
L208552	u921	m60	GONZO	Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
L208551	u920	m60	DUKE	GO?
L208550	u921	m60	GONZO	I have to go.
L208549	u920	m60	DUKE	Not much. Why?
L208548	u921	m60	GONZO	Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
L208547	u920	m60	DUKE	Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
L208546	u921	m60	GONZO	That's what gives me The Fear.
L208545	u920	m60	DUKE	Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
L208544	u921	m60	GONZO	I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
L208536	u921	m60	GONZO	Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
L208535	u920	m60	DUKE	Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
L208534	u920	m60	DUKE	Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
L208531	u921	m60	GONZO	Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
L208530	u920	m60	DUKE	This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
L208525	u921	m60	GONZO	We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
L208524	u920	m60	DUKE	Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
L208523	u921	m60	GONZO	Jesus creeping shit!
L208516	u921	m60	GONZO	What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
L208515	u920	m60	DUKE	Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
L208509	u921	m60	GONZO	Why what?
L208508	u920	m60	DUKE	Why?
L208506	u921	m60	GONZO	To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
L208505	u920	m60	DUKE	Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
L208504	u921	m60	GONZO	"How about ""Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?"" ""Hot Slots,"" that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs..."
L208503	u920	m60	DUKE	Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
L208453	u920	m60	DUKE	They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
L208452	u921	m60	GONZO	I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
L208451	u920	m60	DUKE	That's good...
L208446	u921	m60	GONZO	You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
L208445	u920	m60	DUKE	What are you talking about?
L208441	u920	m60	DUKE	Not yet. I want to study its habits.
L208440	u921	m60	GONZO	Shoot it.
L208435	u920	m60	DUKE	No, no. Don't leave me!
L208434	u921	m60	GONZO	That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
L208432	u920	m60	DUKE	But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
L208431	u921	m60	GONZO	I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
L208430	u921	m60	GONZO	If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
L208429	u920	m60	DUKE	I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
L208426	u920	m60	DUKE	Lacerda?
L208425	u921	m60	GONZO	Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
L208411	u920	m60	DUKE	Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
L208410	u921	m60	GONZO	Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
L208409	u920	m60	DUKE	How long do I have?
L208407	u920	m60	DUKE	You whore!
L208406	u921	m60	GONZO	You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
L208405	u920	m60	DUKE	God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
L208404	u921	m60	GONZO	Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
L208398	u920	m60	DUKE	And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
L208397	u921	m60	GONZO	Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
L208396	u921	m60	GONZO	The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
L208395	u920	m60	DUKE	Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
L208394	u921	m60	GONZO	What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
L208393	u920	m60	DUKE	You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
L208392	u921	m60	GONZO	Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
L208390	u920	m60	DUKE	The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
L208389	u921	m60	GONZO	Where's the medicine?
L208388	u921	m60	GONZO	My heart!
L208387	u920	m60	DUKE	He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
L208386	u920	m60	DUKE	My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
L208385	u921	m60	GONZO	Damn right!
L208384	u920	m60	DUKE	...and we're chock full of that!
L208370	u920	m60	DUKE	We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
L208369	u921	m60	GONZO	We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
L208368	u920	m60	DUKE	Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
L208367	u921	m60	GONZO	O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
L208362	u921	m60	GONZO	Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
L208361	u920	m60	DUKE	I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
L208360	u920	m60	DUKE	Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
L208359	u921	m60	GONZO	God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
L208342	u921	m60	GONZO	It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
L208341	u920	m60	DUKE	Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
L208340	u920	m60	DUKE	Jesus! Did I say that?
L208339	u920	m60	DUKE	If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
L208336	u920	m60	DUKE	No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
L208335	u921	m60	GONZO	We're your friends. We're not like the others.
L208330	u920	m60	DUKE	One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
L208329	u921	m60	GONZO	One toke over the line, sweet Jesus.
L208987	u924	m60	MAID	I fear nothing.
L208986	u920	m60	DUKE	"The password is: ""One Hand Washes The Other."" The minute you hear that, you say ""I fear nothing."""
L208981	u924	m60	MAID	Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
L208980	u920	m60	DUKE	You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
L208979	u924	m60	MAID	You'd pay me for that?
L208971	u924	m60	MAID	No! I swear I'm not!
L208970	u920	m60	DUKE	Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
L208967	u924	m60	MAID	I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
L208966	u920	m60	DUKE	The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
L208961	u924	m60	MAID	Nobody. I'm the maid!
L208960	u920	m60	DUKE	What made you do it? Who paid you off?
L208958	u920	m60	DUKE	YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
L208957	u924	m60	MAID	Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
L208715	u920	m60	DUKE	I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
L208714	u922	m60	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
L208713	u920	m60	DUKE	How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
L208712	u922	m60	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
L208711	u920	m60	DUKE	A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
L208710	u922	m60	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
L208709	u922	m60	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	That's a strange attitude.
L208708	u920	m60	DUKE	Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
L208707	u922	m60	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	You realize...
L208706	u920	m60	DUKE	Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
L208705	u922	m60	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	Could I have that, please?
L208703	u920	m60	DUKE	Of course, officer.
L208702	u922	m60	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN	May I see your license.
L208990	u921	m60	GONZO	Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
L208989	u924	m60	MAID	Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
L208988	u921	m60	GONZO	Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
L208985	u921	m60	GONZO	You and a lot of other people.
L208984	u924	m60	MAID	Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
L208978	u921	m60	GONZO	One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
L208977	u924	m60	MAID	What?
L208973	u924	m60	MAID	Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
L208972	u921	m60	GONZO	In that case, maybe she can help.
L208969	u924	m60	MAID	No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
L208968	u921	m60	GONZO	Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
L208965	u924	m60	MAID	Part of what?
L208964	u921	m60	GONZO	Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
L208963	u924	m60	MAID	I don't know what you're talking about!
L208962	u921	m60	GONZO	You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
L239472	u1120	m74	DANA	I'd rather not.
L239471	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
L239470	u1120	m74	DANA	I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
L239469	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
L239468	u1120	m74	DANA	We don't have a relationship.
L239467	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
L239370	u1120	m74	DANA	I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
L239369	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
L239368	u1120	m74	DANA	Everybody has a choice.
L239367	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
L239366	u1120	m74	DANA	If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
L239365	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
L239364	u1120	m74	DANA	What do you want with my baby?
L239083	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
L239082	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
L238961	u1120	m74	DANA	Good night, Janosz.
L238960	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
L238959	u1120	m74	DANA	No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
L238958	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
L238956	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
L238955	u1120	m74	DANA	Janosz?
L238809	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
L238808	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
L238807	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
L238806	u1120	m74	DANA	Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
L238805	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
L238804	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
L238803	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
L238802	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
L238836	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you.
L238835	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I won't.
L238834	u1120	m74	DANA	Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
L238833	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Certainly.
L238832	u1120	m74	DANA	This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
L238827	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	No.  Not that I can recall.
L238826	u1120	m74	DANA	Does he ever mention me?
L238825	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
L238824	u1120	m74	DANA	How is he these days?
L238823	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Occasionally
L238822	u1120	m74	DANA	Do you ever see him?
L238821	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Oh no.
L238820	u1120	m74	DANA	Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
L238819	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
L238817	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
L238816	u1120	m74	DANA	What are you working on, Egon?
L238813	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
L238812	u1120	m74	DANA	Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
L238747	u1120	m74	DANA	That's exactly what you said last week.
L238746	u1122	m74	FRANK	Okay, that's no problem.
L238745	u1120	m74	DANA	No, you didn't, Frank.
L238744	u1122	m74	FRANK	Didn't I do it?
L238743	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
L238742	u1122	m74	FRANK	That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
L238741	u1122	m74	FRANK	Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
L238740	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
L238739	u1122	m74	FRANK	Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
L238738	u1120	m74	DANA	You're also a human being, Frank.
L238737	u1122	m74	FRANK	I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
L238736	u1120	m74	DANA	Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
L239537	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
L239536	u1120	m74	DANA	That's a terrible thing to say.
L239533	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Same difference.
L239532	u1120	m74	DANA	That's not true.  It was 1620.
L239500	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Finally came to your senses, huh?
L239499	u1120	m74	DANA	I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
L239272	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
L239271	u1120	m74	DANA	Maybe I should call Janine.
L239270	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Let me jingle you right now.
L239269	u1120	m74	DANA	So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
L239268	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
L239267	u1120	m74	DANA	Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
L239266	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm not even good for me.
L239265	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
L239264	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
L239263	u1120	m74	DANA	For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
L239262	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
L239261	u1120	m74	DANA	I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
L239260	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
L239224	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
L239223	u1120	m74	DANA	I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
L239222	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
L239221	u1120	m74	DANA	Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
L239220	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
L239219	u1120	m74	DANA	Does she know anything about babies?
L239218	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
L239217	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
L239216	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
L239215	u1120	m74	DANA	They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
L239213	u1120	m74	DANA	Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
L239212	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Are you all squeaky clean now?
L239153	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
L239152	u1120	m74	DANA	Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
L239151	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Or we could do that.
L239150	u1120	m74	DANA	How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
L239149	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
L239148	u1120	m74	DANA	Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
L239147	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
L239145	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
L239144	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
L239141	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
L239140	u1120	m74	DANA	It was full of this awful pink ooze.
L239139	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
L239138	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, what about the bathtub?
L239137	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
L239135	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
L239134	u1120	m74	DANA	I don't know what to do anymore.
L239133	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
L239132	u1120	m74	DANA	I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
L239131	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
L239130	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
L239129	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
L239128	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
L239097	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
L239096	u1120	m74	DANA	Good-bye, Peter.
L239095	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
L239090	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
L239089	u1120	m74	DANA	He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
L239081	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
L239080	u1120	m74	DANA	I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
L239078	u1120	m74	DANA	I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
L239077	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You're really good, you know.
L239076	u1120	m74	DANA	Oh, hello, Peter.
L239075	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So this is what you do, huh?
L238974	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Thanks.
L238973	u1120	m74	DANA	Good luck.
L238972	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
L238971	u1120	m74	DANA	You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
L238970	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
L238969	u1120	m74	DANA	Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
L238968	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
L238967	u1120	m74	DANA	I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
L238903	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Okay, let's take a look.
L238902	u1120	m74	DANA	That's where the buggy stopped.
L238901	u1120	m74	DANA	We definitely had a moment or two.
L238900	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
L238894	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll supervise.
L238893	u1120	m74	DANA	I'll do it.
L238892	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
L238891	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
L238890	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oscar!  You poor kid!
L238889	u1120	m74	DANA	His name is Oscar.
L238888	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
L238887	u1120	m74	DANA	What do you think?
L238881	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
L238880	u1120	m74	DANA	"Well, when you started introducing me as ""the old ball and chain,"" that's when I left."
L238879	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
L238878	u1120	m74	DANA	You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
L238877	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
L238876	u1120	m74	DANA	"He didn't ""ditch"" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it."
L238875	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
L238874	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
L238873	u1120	m74	DANA	I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
L238872	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
L238871	u1120	m74	DANA	Hello, Peter.
L239299	u1120	m74	DANA	Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
L239298	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Sorry!
L238913	u1120	m74	DANA	Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
L238912	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
L238905	u1120	m74	DANA	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
L238904	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Is this the spot?
L238868	u1120	m74	DANA	Hi, Egon.
L238867	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
L238866	u1120	m74	DANA	Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
L238784	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
L238783	u1121	m74	ELAINE	It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
L238782	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
L238781	u1121	m74	ELAINE	I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
L238780	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
L238779	u1121	m74	ELAINE	According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
L239435	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
L239434	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
L239345	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Now you're talking.
L239344	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
L239343	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
L239342	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	That's quite a story.
L238799	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
L238798	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
L238797	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
L238796	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
L238795	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
L238794	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
L238793	u1123	m74	HARDEMEYER	Can I help you?
L239454	u1124	m74	JANINE	You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
L239453	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
L239452	u1124	m74	JANINE	I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
L239327	u1127	m74	LOUIS	You're right.  We should stay.
L239326	u1124	m74	JANINE	I don't think we should leave her alone.
L239325	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Should we go?
L239280	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Tonight?
L239279	u1124	m74	JANINE	Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
L239278	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Okay.
L239277	u1124	m74	JANINE	You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
L239276	u1127	m74	LOUIS	So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
L239275	u1124	m74	JANINE	It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
L239274	u1127	m74	LOUIS	So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
L239273	u1124	m74	JANINE	I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
L239240	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, sure, that sounds great.
L239239	u1124	m74	JANINE	I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
L239238	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
L239237	u1124	m74	JANINE	Well, good night, Louis.
L239236	u1124	m74	JANINE	That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
L239235	u1127	m74	LOUIS	No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
L239234	u1124	m74	JANINE	Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
L239233	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
L239232	u1124	m74	JANINE	Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
L239231	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
L239230	u1124	m74	JANINE	What are you doing up here?
L239229	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
L239048	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Ghostbusters.
L239047	u1124	m74	JANINE	Who are you going to call?
L239046	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
L239045	u1124	m74	JANINE	It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
L239044	u1127	m74	LOUIS	What is it, honey?
L239486	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
L239485	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
L239194	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
L239193	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
L239184	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
L239183	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
L239182	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is the one that looked at Dana.
L239178	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	The Upper West Side.
L239177	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
L239175	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
L239174	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Then why have you come?
L239173	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I know.
L239172	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
L239094	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	My pleasure.
L239093	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
L239092	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
L239091	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
L239087	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Too bad for the Moldavians.
L239086	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
L239085	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
L239084	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
L239336	u1134	m74	VIGO	So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
L239335	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
L239334	u1134	m74	VIGO	The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
L239333	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	I await the word of Vigo.
L239332	u1134	m74	VIGO	I command you.
L239331	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	-- the sorrow --
L239330	u1134	m74	VIGO	-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
L239329	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Yes, the scourge --
L239328	u1134	m74	VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
L238917	u1134	m74	VIGO	On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
L238916	u1125	m74	JANOSZ	Command me, lord.
L238915	u1134	m74	VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
L239029	u1126	m74	JUDGE	You've got to stop them.  Please!
L239028	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	These boys aren't playing around.
L239027	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Maybe they just want to appeal.
L239026	u1126	m74	JUDGE	They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
L239025	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who are they?
L239024	u1126	m74	JUDGE	You've got to do something!
L239005	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
L239004	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
L239018	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Did I forget something?
L239017	u1126	m74	JUDGE	That's it?  That's all you have to say?
L239015	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
L239014	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Get on with it, counselor!
L239013	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Can I have some of your water?
L239012	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Yes.
L239011	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Your honor, may I approach the bench?
L238999	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Do I?
L238998	u1126	m74	JUDGE	Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
L238995	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
L238994	u1126	m74	JUDGE	The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
L239410	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
L239409	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
L239408	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
L239407	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
L239406	u1127	m74	LOUIS	This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
L239390	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
L239389	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
L239388	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
L239387	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
L239386	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	You were the one who got me in.
L239385	u1127	m74	LOUIS	I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
L239384	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	Like what?
L239383	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
L239382	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
L239381	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
L239380	u1130	m74	SHERMAN	I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
L239379	u1127	m74	LOUIS	Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
L238778	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
L238777	u1128	m74	MILTON	This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
L238776	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
L238775	u1128	m74	MILTON	I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
L238774	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
L238773	u1128	m74	MILTON	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
L238772	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
L239009	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
L239008	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
L239007	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
L239006	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
L239003	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
L239002	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
L238997	u1129	m74	PROSECUTOR	Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
L238996	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
L239527	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
L239526	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
L239525	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	From where -- Neptune?
L239524	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
L239523	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Pretty impressive, huh?
L239476	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
L239475	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So far so good.
L239474	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
L239473	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
L239301	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
L239300	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
L239245	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
L239244	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
L239163	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
L239162	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	"That's it?  ""I'll be back?"""
L239157	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
L239156	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --
L238930	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You need the exercise.
L238929	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	You were supposed to help me with this.
L238911	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I knew that.
L238910	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	That's a thousand million electron volts.
L238899	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
L238898	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
L238897	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What now, Brainiac?
L238884	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
L238883	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'd like to have a stool specimen
L238855	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't even want to know where that is.
L238854	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
L238853	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
L238852	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Hello, Venkman.
L238851	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Egon!
L239491	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Do it!  Just do it!
L239490	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
L239431	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Something good --
L239430	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
L239429	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
L239428	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
L239427	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
L239286	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
L239285	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
L239255	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Nine feet -- ten --
L239254	u1132	m74	STANTZ	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
L239253	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Six feet -- seven -- eight --
L239161	u1132	m74	STANTZ	"This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, ""Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."""
L239160	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	"No, not exactly a man of the people.  ""Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."""
L239052	u1132	m74	STANTZ	And we're the ...
L239051	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	I'm Egon --
L238989	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
L238988	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
L238964	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	"His nickname is ""The Hammer."""
L238963	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
L238941	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	What's the reading?
L238940	u1132	m74	STANTZ	This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
L238939	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
L238907	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
L238906	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Nothing.  Not a trace.
L238844	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Good idea.
L238843	u1132	m74	STANTZ	You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
L238842	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
L238841	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
L238840	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Who was that?
L239508	u1135	m74	WINSTON	There's something very familiar about this painting.
L239507	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
L239297	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	And it's all flowing toward the museum.
L239296	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Rivers of the stuff!
L239257	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	No, the slime is rising.
L239256	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Is the line sinking?
L239196	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
L239195	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
L239111	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
L239110	u1131	m74	SPENGLER	We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
L239535	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
L239534	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What's your story, Pete?
L239529	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
L239528	u1132	m74	STANTZ	My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
L239520	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
L239519	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
L239488	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
L239487	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
L239480	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	She's new in town.
L239479	u1132	m74	STANTZ	My Fault!
L239478	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
L239477	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
L239466	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
L239465	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
L239450	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
L239449	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
L239426	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
L239425	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
L239416	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I hate Jello.
L239415	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It looks like a giant Jello mold.
L239295	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
L239294	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
L239293	u1132	m74	STANTZ	You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
L239249	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
L239248	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
L239243	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
L239242	u1132	m74	STANTZ	We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
L239241	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
L239206	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
L239205	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What happened?
L239186	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'll get one more reading.
L239185	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
L239155	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
L239154	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Did you find anything at Dana's?
L239116	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
L239115	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
L239114	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What kind of tests?
L239113	u1132	m74	STANTZ	We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
L239112	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Like a goat on garbage.
L239109	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
L239108	u1132	m74	STANTZ	This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
L239107	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	This is what you do with your spare time?
L239102	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
L239101	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	And now you're going to eat it?
L239099	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
L239098	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
L239065	u1132	m74	STANTZ	If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
L239064	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
L239057	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
L239056	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
L239055	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
L239050	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I'm Peter --
L239049	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I'm Ray --
L239034	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Okay, let's heat 'em up!
L239033	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
L238920	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
L238919	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
L238918	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
L238909	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
L238908	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	What's that?
L238896	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
L238895	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Well, Holmes, what do you think?
L238865	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Dana!  Dana Barrett!
L238864	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who, Ray?
L238863	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
L238862	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who?  Who?  Who?
L238861	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, Ray --
L238860	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Who?  Just -- someone we know.
L238859	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Who?
L238858	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
L238857	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Great.  So what are you guys working on?
L238850	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
L238849	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
L238848	u1132	m74	STANTZ	I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
L238847	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So, no goat hooves, huh?
L238846	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh, hiya, Pete.
L238845	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
L239494	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
L239493	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
L239459	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
L239458	u1132	m74	STANTZ	She's moving!
L239289	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
L239288	u1135	m74	WINSTON	What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
L239284	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
L239283	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
L239282	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
L239281	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
L239208	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
L239207	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Are you all right?
L239202	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Well don't think!
L239201	u1135	m74	WINSTON	No, I just thought --
L239200	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Are you telling me how to drive?
L239192	u1132	m74	STANTZ	No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
L239191	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
L239190	u1132	m74	STANTZ	What?  Yeah.
L239189	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You finished here?
L239188	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Huh?  What?
L239187	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Now that's one ugly dude.
L239171	u1132	m74	STANTZ	"Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal ""Stabilize -- All Clear."""
L239170	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You got a flux and a half.
L239159	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
L239158	u1132	m74	STANTZ	And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
L239119	u1132	m74	STANTZ	It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
L239118	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Does it have any favorites?
L238771	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
L238770	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
L238769	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
L238768	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
L238767	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
L238766	u1135	m74	WINSTON	That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
L238755	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Then let's do it.
L238754	u1135	m74	WINSTON	I'm ready.
L238753	u1132	m74	STANTZ	Ready?
L239531	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
L239530	u1135	m74	WINSTON	My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
L239463	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
L239462	u1135	m74	WINSTON	How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
L239447	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
L239446	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Wonder what?
L239445	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
L239433	u1135	m74	WINSTON	And decent.
L239432	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	And pure --
L239374	u1135	m74	WINSTON	You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
L239373	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
L239340	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
L239339	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Tell him about the toaster.
L239123	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	So we'll put a warning on the label.
L239122	u1135	m74	WINSTON	Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
L239121	u1133	m74	VENKMAN	I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
L239796	u1136	m75	BRIDE	What's the matter, dear?
L239795	u1141	m75	GROOM	Uuuuuuugh!!
L239794	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
L239792	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Have I done the right thing?
L239791	u1141	m75	GROOM	To the bathroom, where do you think?
L239790	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Now where are you going?
L239789	u1136	m75	BRIDE	I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
L239788	u1141	m75	GROOM	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
L239787	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Roy?  Your clock broke.
L239785	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Well, thanks a lot.
L239784	u1141	m75	GROOM	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
L239783	u1136	m75	BRIDE	Aren't you glad we waited?
L239577	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I was just going to say ""eight.""  You're fantastic!"
L239576	u1137	m75	COED	Eight o'clock?
L239575	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
L239569	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
L239568	u1137	m75	COED	Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
L239567	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
L239554	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
L239553	u1137	m75	COED	No.  They're just coming to me.
L239552	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
L239551	u1137	m75	COED	Ummm -- figure eight?
L239550	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ready?  What is it?
L239546	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
L239545	u1137	m75	COED	Is it a star?
L240310	u1138	m75	DANA	All right, what happened to me?
L240309	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
L240308	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
L240220	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.
L240219	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Are you the Gatekeeper?
L240015	u1144	m75	LOUIS	I got the Twister game for later ...
L240014	u1138	m75	DANA	Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
L240013	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
L240012	u1138	m75	DANA	Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
L240011	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
L240010	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L240009	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you.
L239676	u1138	m75	DANA	I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
L239675	u1144	m75	LOUIS	You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
L239674	u1138	m75	DANA	Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
L239673	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
L239672	u1138	m75	DANA	No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
L239671	u1144	m75	LOUIS	"Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped ""20 Minute Workout"" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?"
L239670	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you sick, Louis?
L239669	u1144	m75	LOUIS	... I thought it was the drug store.
L239668	u1138	m75	DANA	Hi, Louis.
L239667	u1144	m75	LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you ...
L240316	u1138	m75	DANA	Talk to my accountant. 
L240315	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
L240314	u1138	m75	DANA	Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
L240313	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
L240312	u1138	m75	DANA	Really!  Is it gone?
L240311	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
L240064	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Whoa!! Nice voice.
L240063	u1138	m75	DANA	There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
L240062	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
L240061	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am ...
L240060	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
L240059	u1138	m75	DANA	I want you inside me.
L240058	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
L240056	u1138	m75	DANA	Take me now.
L240055	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
L240054	u1138	m75	DANA	Do you want this body?
L240053	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
L240052	u1138	m75	DANA	He is the Destructor.
L240051	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
L240050	u1138	m75	DANA	We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
L240048	u1138	m75	DANA	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
L240047	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
L239944	u1138	m75	DANA	I've got to go now.
L239943	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
L239942	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  Since you put it that way.
L239941	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
L239940	u1138	m75	DANA	I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
L239939	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
L239938	u1138	m75	DANA	What's he doing in my refrigerator.
L239937	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
L239936	u1138	m75	DANA	"Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  ""Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."""
L239935	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
L239934	u1138	m75	DANA	You must have gotten the last copy.
L239933	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name ""Zuul"" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it."
L239932	u1138	m75	DANA	Can't you tell me now?
L239931	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
L239930	u1138	m75	DANA	He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
L239929	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Is he dying or something?
L239928	u1138	m75	DANA	"The ""stiff?""  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man."
L239927	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who's the stiff?
L239926	u1138	m75	DANA	I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
L239925	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
L239924	u1138	m75	DANA	Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
L239923	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're the best one in your row.
L239922	u1138	m75	DANA	You heard it?
L239921	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great rehearsal.
L239776	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No kiss?
L239775	u1138	m75	DANA	Goodbye.
L239774	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay.  Then I'll go.
L239773	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.
L239772	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
L239771	u1138	m75	DANA	Then leave.
L239770	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Don't scream.
L239769	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll scream.
L239768	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I want to help you.
L239767	u1138	m75	DANA	Out!
L239766	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On a purely scientific basis.
L239765	u1138	m75	DANA	That's it.  Get out.
L239764	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I think I should spend the night here.
L239763	u1138	m75	DANA	All right.  What do you want to do?
L239762	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
L239761	u1138	m75	DANA	Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
L239760	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
L239759	u1138	m75	DANA	This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
L239758	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
L239757	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.
L239756	u1138	m75	DANA	Are you all right?
L239755	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Damn!
L239753	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I know.  It happened by itself.
L239752	u1138	m75	DANA	I told you, I ...
L239751	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're quite a housekeeper.
L239750	u1138	m75	DANA	I'll wait here if you don't mind.
L239749	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, let's check it out.
L239748	u1138	m75	DANA	Uh-huh.
L239747	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
L239746	u1138	m75	DANA	What?
L239745	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	That's too bad.
L239743	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Thanks.  What's in there?
L239742	u1138	m75	DANA	Like a used car salesman.
L239741	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No?  What do I act like?
L239740	u1138	m75	DANA	You really don't act like a scientist.
L239739	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
L239738	u1138	m75	DANA	That's a violin concerto.
L239737	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
L239736	u1138	m75	DANA	Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
L239735	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
L239734	u1138	m75	DANA	No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
L239733	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
L239732	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"Spengler,  see if you can find the word ""Zuul"" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment."
L239731	u1138	m75	DANA	No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
L239728	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's in the stars.
L239727	u1138	m75	DANA	Is that your professional opinion?
L239720	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
L239719	u1138	m75	DANA	Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
L239715	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So what do you think it was?
L239714	u1138	m75	DANA	... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
L239711	u1138	m75	DANA	Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
L239710	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We're all professionals here, Miss ...
L239709	u1138	m75	DANA	Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
L239708	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
L239640	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I see.
L239639	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	"Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of ""dodge"" or ""hustle.""  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University."
L239638	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But why?  The students love us!
L239637	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
L239636	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
L239635	u1139	m75	DEAN YAEGER	No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
L239634	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
L240323	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	That would definitely explain it.
L240322	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
L240321	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
L240320	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
L240319	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
L240032	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
L240031	u1140	m75	FIRST BUM	He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
L240030	u1147	m75	SECOND BUM	That is one speedy mutt.
L239621	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	We'll get back to you.
L239620	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Did you see it?  What was it?
L239602	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
L239601	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	What's that got to do with it?
L239593	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
L239592	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
L239591	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
L239590	u1142	m75	HEAD LIBRARIAN	Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
L240232	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Thank you.
L240231	u1143	m75	JANINE	Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
L240230	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't believe in luck.
L240229	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
L240228	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240227	u1143	m75	JANINE	I want you to have this. 
L240118	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's so romantic.
L240117	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
L240116	u1143	m75	JANINE	In the physical sense.
L240115	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Die in what sense?
L240114	u1143	m75	JANINE	Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
L239707	u1143	m75	JANINE	Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
L239706	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I think it's the food of the future.
L239705	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, that's very - unusual.
L239704	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I collect spores, molds and fungus.
L239703	u1143	m75	JANINE	It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
L239702	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Is that a game?
L239701	u1143	m75	JANINE	That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
L239700	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Print is dead.
L239699	u1143	m75	JANINE	You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
L239966	u1143	m75	JANINE	Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
L239965	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
L239964	u1143	m75	JANINE	I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
L239963	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The EPA?  What's he want?
L239962	u1143	m75	JANINE	And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
L239958	u1143	m75	JANINE	Here are tonight's calls.
L239957	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
L239713	u1143	m75	JANINE	What calls?
L239712	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
L239805	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
L239804	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
L239803	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Did you ever report it to anyone?
L239802	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
L239801	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Has this ever happened before?
L239800	u1145	m75	MANAGER	Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
L240208	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
L240207	u1146	m75	PECK	"That's ""Peck!"""
L240206	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
L240197	u1146	m75	PECK	Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
L240196	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
L240157	u1146	m75	PECK	See!  They are using drugs.
L240156	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
L240132	u1146	m75	PECK	Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
L240131	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
L239995	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
L239994	u1146	m75	PECK	Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
L239993	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
L239992	u1146	m75	PECK	Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
L239991	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why do you want to see it?
L239990	u1146	m75	PECK	May I please see the storage facility?
L239989	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"The magic word is ""please."""
L239988	u1146	m75	PECK	And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
L239987	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Because you didn't say the magic word.
L239986	u1146	m75	PECK	And why not, Mr. Venkman?
L239985	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No, you may not.
L239984	u1146	m75	PECK	And may I see this storage facility?
L239983	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, it would.
L239982	u1146	m75	PECK	And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
L239981	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	In a storage facility.
L239980	u1146	m75	PECK	And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
L239979	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm not at liberty to say.
L239978	u1146	m75	PECK	And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
L239977	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You could say that.
L239976	u1146	m75	PECK	I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
L239975	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
L239974	u1146	m75	PECK	Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
L239973	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
L239972	u1146	m75	PECK	Are you Peter Venkman?
L239971	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  How's it going?
L239970	u1146	m75	PECK	I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
L239969	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Can I help you?
L239565	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Then my theory was correct.
L239564	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
L239563	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
L239562	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
L239561	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
L239560	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
L239559	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sorry.  This isn't your day.
L239558	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Two wavy lines?
L239557	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
L239556	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Yes.  I don't like this.
L239555	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Nervous?
L239549	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Close -- but definitely wrong.
L239548	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	Circle?
L239543	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good guess -- but no.
L239542	u1148	m75	SOPHOMORE	A square?
L239541	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	All right.  What is it?
L239902	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wow!
L239901	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
L239900	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
L239899	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
L239898	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
L239897	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
L239896	u1151	m75	STREET PUNK	Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
L239828	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
L239827	u1154	m75	WOMAN	You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
L239826	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
L239825	u1154	m75	WOMAN	What on earth gave you that idea?
L239824	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Were you recently in the bathroom?
L239823	u1154	m75	WOMAN	Yes?
L240302	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	But it's my favorite state.
L240301	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Life is just a state of mind.
L240300	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
L240299	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
L240298	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
L240289	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Full-stream with strogon pulse.
L240288	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What now?
L240184	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
L240183	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	You talked to Gozer?
L240182	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Gozer.
L240181	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Who?
L240180	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"She said he was ""the Destructor."""
L240179	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
L240178	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
L240177	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
L240153	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, shit!
L240152	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Where's the Keymaster?
L240134	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
L240133	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	He wants to shut down the storage grid.
L240113	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right, Peter.  Good night.
L240112	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
L240111	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	All right.  I'll try.
L240110	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
L240109	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I agree.
L240108	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
L240107	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
L240106	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
L240105	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Does she want to be?
L240104	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
L240103	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	What is it?
L240102	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
L239858	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
L239857	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"What do you mean ""bad?"""
L239856	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Trust me.  It will be bad.
L239855	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Why not?
L239854	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Don't cross the beams.
L239853	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?
L239852	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
L239819	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, I can smell it.
L239818	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Something was definitely here.
L239780	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
L239779	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Did you see anything?
L239718	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
L239717	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
L239656	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
L239655	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
L239629	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Wow!
L239628	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm always serious.
L239627	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
L239589	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
L239588	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
L239587	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What have you got, Egon?
L239586	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Oh!  You're here.
L240272	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	That appears to be the case.
L240271	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
L240170	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
L240169	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
L240151	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
L240150	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What happened??!!!?
L240000	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
L239999	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239998	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I've got to sleep.
L239997	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Neutronize.  System shut.
L239996	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Set entry grid.
L239869	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
L239868	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's working!
L239832	u1150	m75	STANTZ	God, it's ugly!
L239831	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
L239817	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	We'd better adjust our streams.
L239816	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sorry, Buddy!
L239811	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	I blame myself.
L239810	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
L239722	u1149	m75	SPENGLER	Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
L239721	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
L240287	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
L240286	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
L240285	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
L240280	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Look!
L240279	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What?  What popped in there?
L240278	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
L240262	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
L240261	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Agile bastard, isn't he?
L240255	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, that ought to do it.
L240254	u1150	m75	STANTZ	As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
L240252	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't think it's Shandor.
L240251	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
L240176	u1150	m75	STANTZ	He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
L240175	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Who was the architect?
L240174	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
L240173	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
L240006	u1150	m75	STANTZ	It's not good, Pete.
L240005	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
L239956	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
L239955	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy, that was a rough one.
L239845	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
L239844	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	How do you know?
L239843	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
L239842	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
L239841	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
L239840	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
L239839	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Third floor.  Get down here,
L239838	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Where are you, Pete?
L239837	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray -- Something's here.
L239822	u1150	m75	STANTZ	All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
L239821	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
L239820	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
L239814	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
L239813	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No sense worrying about it now.
L239812	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	So do I.
L239782	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
L239781	u1150	m75	STANTZ	They will.
L239778	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
L239777	u1150	m75	STANTZ	How was your date?
L239730	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
L239729	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
L239697	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Fourteen hundred.
L239696	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
L239695	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
L239663	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	"This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of ""pricey"" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company."
L239662	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Wow!  Does this pole still work?
L239658	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
L239657	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But most people are afraid to even report these things.
L239654	u1150	m75	STANTZ	But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
L239653	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
L239652	u1150	m75	STANTZ	My parents left me that house, I was born there.
L239651	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You'll never regret this, Ray.
L239649	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	To go into business for ourselves.
L239648	u1150	m75	STANTZ	For what purpose?
L239647	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
L239646	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
L239645	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
L239644	u1150	m75	STANTZ	This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
L239642	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
L239641	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
L239633	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
L239632	u1150	m75	STANTZ	If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
L239631	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
L239624	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
L239623	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
L239622	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Get her?  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
L239615	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
L239614	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
L239613	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Anything!  Just make contact.
L239612	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do I say?
L239611	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I don't know.  Talk to it.
L239610	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	What do we do now?
L239609	u1150	m75	STANTZ	I told you it's real.
L239607	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
L239606	u1150	m75	STANTZ	What is it?
L239583	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
L239582	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
L239581	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Looked at with your eyes.
L239580	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean by ""seen?"""
L239579	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
L239578	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
L239574	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
L239573	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
L239572	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
L239571	u1152	m75	VENKMAN	Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
L240268	u1150	m75	STANTZ	"What do you mean ""choose?""  We don't understand."
L240267	u1153	m75	WINSTON	What's he talking about?  Choose what?
L240121	u1150	m75	STANTZ	LATER, MAN!!
L240120	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Stantz?  You okay in there?
L240088	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  We'll believe anything.
L240087	u1150	m75	STANTZ	You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
L240083	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
L240082	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
L240081	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, Judgement Day.
L240080	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Judgement Day ...
L240079	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Right.  And the sky would fall ...
L240078	u1150	m75	STANTZ	And the seas would boil ...
L240077	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
L240076	u1150	m75	STANTZ	The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
L240075	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
L240074	u1150	m75	STANTZ	No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
L240073	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Do you believe in God?
L240072	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
L240071	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Me, too.
L240070	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Mmmhmmm.
L240069	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Are you a Christian, Ray?
L240068	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
L240067	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
L239968	u1153	m75	WINSTON	Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
L239967	u1150	m75	STANTZ	Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
L274152	u1297	m86	MANNING	Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
L274151	u1289	m86	ABE	They were over here, Professor.
L274150	u1289	m86	ABE	Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
L274149	u1297	m86	MANNING	Is he serious??
L274148	u1289	m86	ABE	The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
L274147	u1297	m86	MANNING	See what??
L274146	u1289	m86	ABE	"I need to touch it to ""see""..."
L274265	u1289	m86	ABE	Oh, right --
L274264	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
L274263	u1289	m86	ABE	Remind me why I keep doing this.
L274207	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Didn't even buy me a drink.
L274206	u1289	m86	ABE	Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
L274200	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
L274199	u1289	m86	ABE	Red. How long was it latched onto you?
L274190	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I'm lucky that way.
L274189	u1289	m86	ABE	You were burned by some organic acid.
L274088	u1289	m86	ABE	No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
L274087	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Nah -- he's taken care of.
L274082	u1289	m86	ABE	Red, I found something --
L274081	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
L274078	u1289	m86	ABE	Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
L274077	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
L274064	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	We don't take hints.
L274063	u1289	m86	ABE	Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
L274062	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
L274061	u1289	m86	ABE	Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
L274060	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't get psychic with me.
L274059	u1289	m86	ABE	You mean, outside... with her.
L274058	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
L274057	u1289	m86	ABE	Story of my life.
L274056	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
L274094	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	It doesn't say --
L274093	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
L274092	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
L274091	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	-- Hound of resurrection?
L274090	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	See? I don't like that --
L274089	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	hound of resurrection --
L274086	u1290	m86	ABE'S VOICE	Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
L274085	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	That's all for you, Sammy.
L273934	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	From where??!!
L273933	u1291	m86	BROOM	Cordon off the area. Something came through.
L273912	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Air and sea backup. What's closest?
L273911	u1291	m86	BROOM	If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
L273910	u1291	m86	BROOM	Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
L273909	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	The freak in the gas mask --
L273906	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Oh, I'll bet you have.
L273905	u1291	m86	BROOM	I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
L273904	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
L273903	u1291	m86	BROOM	Paranormal  But -- you read the transmission.
L273902	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
L273901	u1291	m86	BROOM	Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
L273900	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
L273899	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	"Three days too late for that one, ""professor."""
L273898	u1291	m86	BROOM	I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
L273897	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Here. You'll need one of these.
L273896	u1291	m86	BROOM	Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
L273895	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	You are a Catholic??
L273893	u1291	m86	BROOM	In private, if you don't mind...
L273892	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	What is it?
L273891	u1291	m86	BROOM	Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
L273890	u1300	m86	WHITMAN	Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
L273889	u1291	m86	BROOM	This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
L273948	u1291	m86	BROOM	I think that is its hand.
L273947	u1298	m86	MATLIN	It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
L273943	u1291	m86	BROOM	No. It was red. Bright red.
L273942	u1298	m86	MATLIN	What the hell was that? An ape?
L273941	u1298	m86	MATLIN	That makes him more than a hundred --
L273940	u1291	m86	BROOM	Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
L273939	u1298	m86	MATLIN	C'mon -- Rasputin??
L273938	u1291	m86	BROOM	Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
L273937	u1298	m86	MATLIN	Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
L273936	u1291	m86	BROOM	There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
L273935	u1298	m86	MATLIN	Do you believe in hell?
L273932	u1291	m86	BROOM	No. It's not.
L273931	u1298	m86	MATLIN	It's almost over!!
L274144	u1291	m86	BROOM	I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
L274143	u1297	m86	MANNING	These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
L274141	u1291	m86	BROOM	He's just going through a phase --
L274140	u1297	m86	MANNING	"Your ""guest"" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded."
L274139	u1291	m86	BROOM	Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
L274138	u1297	m86	MANNING	I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
L274137	u1291	m86	BROOM	I thought you liked being on TV.
L274136	u1297	m86	MANNING	Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
L274235	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Oh, as opposed to -- ?
L274234	u1291	m86	BROOM	It's her choice --  She's human --
L274233	u1291	m86	BROOM	That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
L274232	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
L274205	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Is it bad?
L274204	u1291	m86	BROOM	Don't look! Turn around.
L274198	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
L274197	u1291	m86	BROOM	Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
L274196	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Me?? C'mon --
L274195	u1291	m86	BROOM	I worry about you.
L274194	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
L274193	u1291	m86	BROOM	Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
L274192	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
L274191	u1291	m86	BROOM	Son. About Rasputin --
L274076	u1291	m86	BROOM	A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
L274075	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Reliquary --
L274074	u1291	m86	BROOM	Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
L274073	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Who wards off demons.
L274072	u1291	m86	BROOM	A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
L274217	u1299	m86	MYERS	"Oh, please. I'm not ""pure of heart."""
L274216	u1291	m86	BROOM	And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
L274213	u1291	m86	BROOM	You're doing fine.
L274212	u1299	m86	MYERS	I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
L274018	u1291	m86	BROOM	Did he, now?
L274017	u1299	m86	MYERS	1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
L274016	u1291	m86	BROOM	1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
L274011	u1291	m86	BROOM	In the absence of light, darkness prevails. For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
L274010	u1299	m86	MYERS	In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt...
L274009	u1291	m86	BROOM	Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
L274008	u1299	m86	MYERS	On the desk, yes. In Latin.
L274007	u1291	m86	BROOM	As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
L274006	u1299	m86	MYERS	Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
L274005	u1291	m86	BROOM	"Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  ""Unique."" That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here."
L274004	u1299	m86	MYERS	How does he know so much about me?
L274002	u1291	m86	BROOM	"The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence ""Abe"" Sapien."
L274001	u1299	m86	MYERS	Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
L274000	u1291	m86	BROOM	They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
L274188	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
L274187	u1292	m86	CLAY	C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
L274069	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
L274068	u1292	m86	CLAY	At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
L274054	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
L274053	u1292	m86	CLAY	We're on the move.
L274052	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
L274046	u1292	m86	CLAY	Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
L274045	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Myers, huh? You have a first name??
L274044	u1292	m86	CLAY	It is. You got yourself on TV again.
L274043	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
L274042	u1292	m86	CLAY	Well, you did break out --
L274039	u1292	m86	CLAY	Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
L274038	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I don't want him.
L274037	u1292	m86	CLAY	Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
L274036	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Got tired of me?
L274035	u1292	m86	CLAY	Agent Myers is your new liaison.
L274034	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Who's the squirt?
L274176	u1292	m86	CLAY	Not so fast. He barely knows him --
L274175	u1299	m86	MYERS	Sir, may I go first??
L274049	u1299	m86	MYERS	His what??!!
L274048	u1292	m86	CLAY	"His horns. He files 'em. To ""fit in."""
L274047	u1299	m86	MYERS	Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
L274031	u1292	m86	CLAY	Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
L274030	u1299	m86	MYERS	Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
L274027	u1299	m86	MYERS	Who?!
L274026	u1292	m86	CLAY	He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
L274024	u1292	m86	CLAY	Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
L274023	u1299	m86	MYERS	Grounded? Who's grounded?
L274022	u1292	m86	CLAY	They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
L274508	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I can live with that.
L274507	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
L274502	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Anung-un-Rama...
L274501	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	"Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: ""The crossroads.""  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key."
L274498	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Noooo! Noooo!!!
L274497	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	She's dead.
L274099	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
L274098	u1293	m86	GRIGORY	I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
L274097	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	That voice --
L274469	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	My job.
L274468	u1297	m86	MANNING	Thank you.
L274466	u1297	m86	MANNING	You never, ever light a cigar that way.
L274465	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Yup.
L274464	u1297	m86	MANNING	You call that thing a cigar??
L274463	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
L274452	u1297	m86	MANNING	I'm in charge. We go back!
L274451	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No. Don't --
L274450	u1297	m86	MANNING	-- should go back. Now!
L274449	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Don't move. We --
L274448	u1297	m86	MANNING	We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
L274426	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I won't take 'em. They never work.
L274425	u1297	m86	MANNING	Each of us gets a belt.
L274424	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Those things never work. Never.
L274423	u1297	m86	MANNING	We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
L274422	u1297	m86	MANNING	When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
L274421	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	One falls, two shall arise. So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
L274306	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I wish I could be more gracious but --
L274305	u1297	m86	MANNING	In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
L274304	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What are you trying to say?
L274303	u1297	m86	MANNING	That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
L274302	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
L274301	u1297	m86	MANNING	Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
L274300	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I knew those men better than you did --
L274299	u1297	m86	MANNING	But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
L274516	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	How big can it be?
L274515	u1299	m86	MYERS	Alone?
L274514	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
L274446	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
L274445	u1299	m86	MYERS	Are you sure about this?
L274339	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Good night.
L274338	u1299	m86	MYERS	Well good n-
L274337	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Not from you.
L274336	u1299	m86	MYERS	Anything else you --
L274332	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Not hungry.
L274331	u1299	m86	MYERS	Hey, your chili's getting cold --
L274322	u1299	m86	MYERS	Start in, you got nachos coming.
L274321	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"Nah, sounds too ""needy."""
L274320	u1299	m86	MYERS	Need is a good, solid word.
L274319	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for ""need"" --"
L274318	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Shh! Just a second.
L274317	u1299	m86	MYERS	Where do you --
L274242	u1299	m86	MYERS	Hostage negotiations.
L274241	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What was that??
L274240	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"What landed you this job, pushing ""pamcakes""? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?"
L274239	u1299	m86	MYERS	I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
L274238	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hey. You: think twice --
L274237	u1299	m86	MYERS	Professor, that girl you were talking about --
L274236	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	"Mmmh -- ""Pamcakes."" We're going out --"
L274210	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
L274209	u1299	m86	MYERS	Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
L274202	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	That's right, Stud, hold me down.
L274201	u1299	m86	MYERS	You want me to hold him down?
L274186	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Could've fooled me. Go away.
L274185	u1299	m86	MYERS	No. I never was.
L274184	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What are you, a Boy Scout?
L274183	u1299	m86	MYERS	C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
L274182	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	What took you so long?
L274132	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Goodbye.
L274131	u1299	m86	MYERS	Yes?
L274130	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Myers?
L274129	u1299	m86	MYERS	No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
L274128	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
L274127	u1299	m86	MYERS	Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
L274126	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
L274124	u1299	m86	MYERS	My arm is fine. Where are you??
L274123	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Myers??? How's your arm?
L274103	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	No one ever helps me. It's my job.
L274102	u1299	m86	MYERS	Helping you -- I just --
L274051	u1299	m86	MYERS	Oh-n-no -- I --
L274050	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Whatcha looking at, John??
L274041	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Father's back?  Still angry?
L274040	u1299	m86	MYERS	Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
L274029	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
L274028	u1299	m86	MYERS	You're kidding --
L274444	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	...Polo.
L274443	u1295	m86	LIZ	Marco...
L274442	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
L274410	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Good.
L274409	u1295	m86	LIZ	I like that...
L274408	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
L274407	u1295	m86	LIZ	Red, I --
L274406	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
L274404	u1295	m86	LIZ	I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
L274403	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Hi.
L274335	u1295	m86	LIZ	Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
L274334	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
L274329	u1295	m86	LIZ	No. Myers is taking me.
L274328	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	You're going alone?
L274327	u1295	m86	LIZ	For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
L274326	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Out? Out out?
L274325	u1295	m86	LIZ	Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
L274324	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
L274180	u1295	m86	LIZ	Goodnight.
L274179	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Goodnight, then.
L274171	u1295	m86	LIZ	No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
L274170	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
L274169	u1294	m86	HELLBOY	Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
L274168	u1295	m86	LIZ	You better have that looked at.
L274481	u1299	m86	MYERS	What?
L274480	u1295	m86	LIZ	Hit me.
L274474	u1295	m86	LIZ	You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
L274473	u1299	m86	MYERS	That you feel that way about me.
L274472	u1295	m86	LIZ	What -- ?
L274471	u1299	m86	MYERS	But it's not true, is it?
L274359	u1295	m86	LIZ	Coffee's warming me up.
L274358	u1299	m86	MYERS	It's freezing, isn't it?
L274355	u1295	m86	LIZ	Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
L274354	u1299	m86	MYERS	What about you?
L274353	u1295	m86	LIZ	I know.
L274352	u1299	m86	MYERS	He -- loves you.
L274351	u1299	m86	MYERS	My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
L274350	u1295	m86	LIZ	A brute.
L274349	u1299	m86	MYERS	Strong.
L274348	u1295	m86	LIZ	Cocky.
L274347	u1299	m86	MYERS	No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
L274346	u1295	m86	LIZ	He's just pushy.
L274345	u1299	m86	MYERS	I admire him. He's a force of nature.
L274251	u1299	m86	MYERS	Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
L274250	u1295	m86	LIZ	Doesn't sounds like him.
L274249	u1299	m86	MYERS	Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
L274248	u1299	m86	MYERS	It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
L274247	u1295	m86	LIZ	"60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED ""LIZ""."
L274246	u1299	m86	MYERS	Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
L273988	u1296	m86	LOBBY GUARD	Two steps back, please.
L273987	u1299	m86	MYERS	Pardon?
L273986	u1296	m86	LOBBY GUARD	-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
L273985	u1299	m86	MYERS	Yes, I --
L273984	u1296	m86	LOBBY GUARD	-- Late. Five minutes late.
L273983	u1299	m86	MYERS	Hello, I'm --
L282389	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Go to hell.
L282388	u1328	m89	DENNIS	I warned you.
L282065	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Sure.
L282064	u1328	m89	DENNIS	Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
L282063	u1328	m89	DENNIS	Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
L282062	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
L282061	u1328	m89	DENNIS	He'd want to know about all this.
L282060	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Yeah.
L282059	u1328	m89	DENNIS	Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
L282058	u1328	m89	DENNIS	Find the father.  That should clear things up.
L282057	u1326	m89	BRENNA	P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
L282056	u1328	m89	DENNIS	How old is Richard?
L282055	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
L282054	u1328	m89	DENNIS	Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
L282053	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
L282052	u1328	m89	DENNIS	Maybe he's hiding from something.
L282051	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
L281887	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It's in good condition.
L281886	u1331	m89	EXAMINER	You're the expert.
L281885	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
L281884	u1331	m89	EXAMINER	Huh?
L281883	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Claymore.
L281882	u1331	m89	EXAMINER	Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
L281881	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
L281880	u1331	m89	EXAMINER	"Didn't look like it came from ""Toys-Are-Us"", that's why I called you."
L281878	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Fine.
L281877	u1331	m89	EXAMINER	How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
L281874	u1331	m89	EXAMINER	This one came unassembled.
L281873	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Doesn't have a head, does he?
L282217	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Thanks.
L282216	u1343	m89	MAN	Happy birthday.
L282215	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It's my birthday.
L282214	u1343	m89	MAN	You're very macabre.
L282213	u1326	m89	BRENNA	There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
L282212	u1343	m89	MAN	That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
L282036	u1338	m89	KIDELL	Carl Smith.
L282035	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Would you remember his name?
L282034	u1338	m89	KIDELL	There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
L282033	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
L282031	u1338	m89	KIDELL	Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
L282030	u1326	m89	BRENNA	The boy _died_?
L282029	u1338	m89	KIDELL	Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
L282028	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I don't follow you.
L282027	u1338	m89	KIDELL	Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
L282026	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
L282025	u1338	m89	KIDELL	No.
L282024	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Then you didn't know Richard later on.
L282023	u1338	m89	KIDELL	Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
L282022	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Why?
L282021	u1338	m89	KIDELL	He was unsual.
L282020	u1326	m89	BRENNA	No thank you, I'm fine.
L282019	u1338	m89	KIDELL	Would you like more tea?
L282002	u1329	m89	DESK OFFICER	Anything in Maryland is close.
L282001	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
L282000	u1329	m89	DESK OFFICER	Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
L281999	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
L281998	u1329	m89	DESK OFFICER	-Okay okay.
L281997	u1326	m89	BRENNA	So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
L281996	u1329	m89	DESK OFFICER	This is against the rules.
L282738	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Yes.
L282737	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
L282736	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
L282735	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You have lived forever.
L282734	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
L282733	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Not power.  Not control.
L282732	u1326	m89	BRENNA	The inheritance.
L282731	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
L282727	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
L282726	u1326	m89	BRENNA	No!
L282725	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Get out.
L282724	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
L282723	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What is it?
L282721	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
L282720	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What's wrong?
L282659	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
L282658	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Will I see you again?
L282657	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
L282656	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	All of it finished.
L282655	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What is it you want?
L282654	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
L282653	u1326	m89	BRENNA	But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
L282652	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
L282651	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What is it like?  Being you?
L282640	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Damn you.
L282639	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Come here, Brenna.
L282638	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Don't.
L282636	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Is that a threat?
L282635	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I haven't killed _you_.
L282634	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You kill with your left hand?
L282633	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	There are differences.
L282632	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
L282631	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Sometimes innocents become involved.
L282630	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What about that family in '31?
L282629	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Not the same.
L282628	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You killed those other two.
L282627	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I didn't kill the watchman.
L282626	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Of bodies.
L282625	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
L282624	u1326	m89	BRENNA	That's insane.
L282623	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
L282622	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
L282621	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	He is older than I.
L282620	u1326	m89	BRENNA	He knows about you.
L282619	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Yes.
L282618	u1326	m89	BRENNA	That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
L282617	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
L282614	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'd like you to try.
L282613	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	That would be difficult to explain.
L282612	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Who are you?
L282607	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Just a little crazy.
L282606	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You are a very perceptive young woman.
L282605	u1326	m89	BRENNA	My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
L282604	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
L282603	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'm not even sure why.
L282602	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I see.
L282601	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
L282600	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Why are you here?
L282599	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
L282598	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You won't.
L282597	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I hope I never get that old.
L282596	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	A factor of age.
L282595	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
L282594	u1326	m89	BRENNA	That's impossible.
L282593	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	At least.
L282592	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Then you must be at least 70 years old.
L282590	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
L282589	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You're using your son's name.
L282588	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Yes.
L282587	u1326	m89	BRENNA	And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
L282586	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Yes.
L282585	u1326	m89	BRENNA	William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
L282584	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Follow me.
L282583	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
L282536	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	A little dusty.
L282535	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It's beautiful.
L282534	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
L282532	u1326	m89	BRENNA	There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
L282531	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Maybe it would do us both good.
L282530	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
L282529	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	They do it each year.
L282528	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
L282527	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Well, as long as we're stuck here.
L282526	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Yes.
L282525	u1326	m89	BRENNA	No.  So what now?  We just wait?
L282523	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
L282522	u1326	m89	BRENNA	The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
L282521	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I wish I could.
L282520	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Yes.
L282519	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
L282418	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
L282417	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You want me to front for you.
L282416	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
L282415	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You make it all sound so simple.
L282414	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
L282413	u1326	m89	BRENNA	When you finish, what then?
L282412	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Not all of them.
L282411	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You did kill those men.
L282410	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
L282409	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What's all that?
L282403	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You are.  Now.
L282402	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
L282401	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You've been listening to rumors.
L282400	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Is this what you killed them with?
L282398	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Maybe.
L282397	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You're a fool.
L282396	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You're wrong.
L282395	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You had to do _nothing_!
L282394	u1326	m89	BRENNA	No.  I had to talk to you.
L282393	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	No one knows you're here?
L282392	u1326	m89	BRENNA	No.
L282292	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Are you?
L282291	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	He sees me as a threat.
L282289	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Go home.
L282288	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
L282287	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You are being foolish.
L282286	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'd rather hear yours.
L282285	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
L282284	u1326	m89	BRENNA	No.
L282283	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Have you gone to the police?
L282282	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
L282281	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You?
L282280	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What about me?
L282279	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
L282278	u1326	m89	BRENNA	He was innocent.
L282277	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	That bothers you?
L282276	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
L282275	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Not your concern.
L282274	u1326	m89	BRENNA	"He called you ""MacLeod""."
L282273	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
L282272	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What will you do now?
L282271	u1326	m89	BRENNA	And you?
L282270	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	At the moment?  Carl Smith.
L282269	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Who is he?
L282268	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Dupont Circle.
L282267	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Where?
L282266	u1326	m89	BRENNA	He tried to kill me last night.
L282117	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What the hell is going on?
L282116	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Tradition.
L282115	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Why not?
L282114	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
L282113	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Jesus Christ.
L282093	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
L282092	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I have friends.
L282090	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
L282089	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I've been to Church Hill.
L282088	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You have an active imagination.
L282087	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
L282086	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I don't know what you're talking about.
L282085	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Does Carl Smith?
L282084	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	People like that rarely leave business cards.
L282083	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Who?
L282082	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Probably.
L282081	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Grave robbers?
L282080	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
L282079	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Someone beat you.
L281958	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Good day, Miss Cartwright.
L281957	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Good reflexes.
L281956	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
L281955	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
L281954	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Basil the II.
L281953	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Byzantine?
L281952	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
L281951	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
L281950	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	It's not mine.
L281949	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
L281948	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
L281947	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Very traditional.
L281946	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Yes.
L281945	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Do you play?
L282048	u1354	m89	UNCLE JOE	Call your mother.  You never call her.
L282047	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Thanks.
L282046	u1354	m89	UNCLE JOE	Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
L282045	u1354	m89	UNCLE JOE	Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
L282044	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Now there's a new topic.
L282043	u1354	m89	UNCLE JOE	Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
L282040	u1354	m89	UNCLE JOE	"You're never ""just curious"".  You've met my neice, Brenna."
L282039	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'm just curious.
L282038	u1354	m89	UNCLE JOE	Forget it.
L282386	u1345	m89	MORAN	Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
L282385	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Never take up poker, Detective.
L282384	u1345	m89	MORAN	I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
L282383	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
L282382	u1345	m89	MORAN	What were you doing in Felton?
L282381	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What's all of this got to do with me?
L282380	u1345	m89	MORAN	Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
L282379	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What makes you so sure he's the one?
L282378	u1345	m89	MORAN	I want Taupin.
L282377	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You're an asshole, Moran.
L282376	u1345	m89	MORAN	But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
L282375	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It'll never stick.
L282374	u1345	m89	MORAN	You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
L282373	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What are you getting at, Moran?
L282372	u1345	m89	MORAN	But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
L282371	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Spare me the details.
L282370	u1345	m89	MORAN	All fashionably without heads.
L282369	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Four?
L282368	u1345	m89	MORAN	What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
L282367	u1326	m89	BRENNA	We've got nothing to say.
L282366	u1345	m89	MORAN	You and I should talk first.
L282365	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'm calling an attorney.
L282364	u1345	m89	MORAN	Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
L282363	u1326	m89	BRENNA	What do you want from me?
L282362	u1345	m89	MORAN	I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
L282361	u1326	m89	BRENNA	You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
L282360	u1345	m89	MORAN	A murder.
L282356	u1341	m89	LIBRARIAN	Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
L282355	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Who is it?
L282354	u1341	m89	LIBRARIAN	You always were hard to impress.
L282353	u1326	m89	BRENNA	It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
L282352	u1341	m89	LIBRARIAN	I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
L282351	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
L282350	u1341	m89	LIBRARIAN	Good way to lose your job.
L282347	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Yeah.
L282346	u1341	m89	LIBRARIAN	It's that important?
L282345	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Corey, you _owe_ me.
L282344	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
L282343	u1341	m89	LIBRARIAN	You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
L282342	u1326	m89	BRENNA	All I need is for you to check the name.
L282341	u1341	m89	LIBRARIAN	Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
L281972	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Give it a rest Ned, huh?
L281971	u1350	m89	SUPERVISOR	You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
L281970	u1326	m89	BRENNA	Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
L281967	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
L281966	u1350	m89	SUPERVISOR	Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
L281961	u1326	m89	BRENNA	He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
L281960	u1350	m89	SUPERVISOR	Why?
L281959	u1326	m89	BRENNA	I don't believe him.
L281990	u1327	m89	CONOR	Stop!
L281989	u1352	m89	TAVERN MAN #2	-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
L281988	u1327	m89	CONOR	Stop.
L281987	u1352	m89	TAVERN MAN #2	-Auditorium nostrum-
L281986	u1327	m89	CONOR	Be quiet.
L281985	u1352	m89	TAVERN MAN #2	-Luceat ei-
L281984	u1327	m89	CONOR	You'll not be bringing the church into this.
L281983	u1352	m89	TAVERN MAN #2	-Et lux perpetua-
L281982	u1327	m89	CONOR	What are you doing man?
L281981	u1352	m89	TAVERN MAN #2	Requiem acer'nam donaei-
L282333	u1327	m89	CONOR	I'll be back when I can.
L282332	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
L282328	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
L282327	u1327	m89	CONOR	That is not me.
L282326	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
L282325	u1327	m89	CONOR	Of course.
L282324	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
L282323	u1327	m89	CONOR	I am not ready for this.
L282322	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
L282321	u1327	m89	CONOR	And you?
L282320	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
L282319	u1327	m89	CONOR	But why be so concerned about me?
L282318	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
L282317	u1327	m89	CONOR	I feel hardly nothing.
L282316	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
L282315	u1327	m89	CONOR	I do not think I like the sound of that.
L282314	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
L282313	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
L282312	u1327	m89	CONOR	What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
L282311	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
L282310	u1327	m89	CONOR	You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
L282308	u1327	m89	CONOR	If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
L282307	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
L282306	u1327	m89	CONOR	And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
L282305	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You have a gift.  One you must protect.
L282304	u1327	m89	CONOR	It's like to kill me first.
L282303	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	It will take less effort as you learn.
L282301	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Muy Bien!
L282300	u1327	m89	CONOR	Impotent cow.
L282299	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
L282298	u1327	m89	CONOR	Go to hell.
L282297	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
L282296	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Again.  Try again.
L282295	u1327	m89	CONOR	Me arm hurts.
L282294	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Harder.  Concentrate harder.
L282200	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
L282199	u1327	m89	CONOR	Why?
L282198	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
L282197	u1327	m89	CONOR	How can I stop such a man?
L282196	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
L282195	u1327	m89	CONOR	But we cannot be killed.
L282194	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
L282193	u1327	m89	CONOR	Aye.
L282192	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
L282191	u1327	m89	CONOR	Why does he want to kill me?
L282190	u1327	m89	CONOR	Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
L282189	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
L282188	u1327	m89	CONOR	Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
L282187	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You will live.  Survive.
L282186	u1327	m89	CONOR	What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
L282185	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
L282184	u1327	m89	CONOR	This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
L282183	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
L282182	u1327	m89	CONOR	This can't be.
L282181	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
L282173	u1327	m89	CONOR	No!
L282172	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	It is the truth.
L282171	u1327	m89	CONOR	This is madness!
L282170	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Listen to me.  Hear the words.
L282169	u1327	m89	CONOR	No!
L282168	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	It is as you are.
L282166	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	We are immortal.
L282165	u1327	m89	CONOR	What?
L282164	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
L282163	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Not even a single lifetime.
L282162	u1327	m89	CONOR	I'm twenty-two.
L282161	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You are still so very young.
L282160	u1327	m89	CONOR	I don't understand.
L282159	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
L282158	u1327	m89	CONOR	He told me there could be only one.
L282157	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	We are brothers.
L282156	u1327	m89	CONOR	I don't know why.
L282155	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You feel you know me.
L282154	u1327	m89	CONOR	It is less.
L282153	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Does it change with me in the room?
L282152	u1327	m89	CONOR	Yes.  Always.
L282151	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
L282150	u1327	m89	CONOR	You are the same?
L282149	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
L282147	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	It was time for our paths to cross.
L282146	u1327	m89	CONOR	You know me home.  Me name.
L282145	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
L282144	u1327	m89	CONOR	You're a long way from Inverness.
L282143	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
L282142	u1327	m89	CONOR	Why are you here?
L282141	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
L282140	u1327	m89	CONOR	Pheasant.
L282139	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
L282138	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
L282137	u1327	m89	CONOR	How can you know this?
L282136	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
L282135	u1327	m89	CONOR	I was driven out.
L282134	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
L282133	u1327	m89	CONOR	Aye.
L282132	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
L282131	u1327	m89	CONOR	I did at that.
L282130	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	But you lived.
L282129	u1327	m89	CONOR	I was nearly killed.
L282128	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Your marks would suggest great injury.
L282127	u1327	m89	CONOR	Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
L282126	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
L282125	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Please go to no trouble.
L282124	u1327	m89	CONOR	I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
L282123	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
L282122	u1327	m89	CONOR	You're not from these parts.
L282121	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
L282120	u1327	m89	CONOR	Aye.
L282119	u1349	m89	ROMIREZ	Your name is Conor?
L282118	u1327	m89	CONOR	Afternoon.
L281943	u1344	m89	MARA	Do what you must.
L281942	u1327	m89	CONOR	If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
L281941	u1327	m89	CONOR	You're not talking sense, Mara!
L281940	u1344	m89	MARA	Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
L281939	u1327	m89	CONOR	I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
L281938	u1344	m89	MARA	Please not be touching me, Conor.
L281936	u1344	m89	MARA	Me father has taken back my hand.
L281935	u1327	m89	CONOR	You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
L281934	u1344	m89	MARA	I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
L281933	u1327	m89	CONOR	That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
L281932	u1344	m89	MARA	There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
L281931	u1327	m89	CONOR	Who?
L281930	u1344	m89	MARA	Some think not.
L281929	u1327	m89	CONOR	So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
L281928	u1344	m89	MARA	Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
L281927	u1327	m89	CONOR	But I did live.
L281926	u1344	m89	MARA	You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
L281925	u1327	m89	CONOR	What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
L281924	u1344	m89	MARA	My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
L281923	u1327	m89	CONOR	I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
L281922	u1344	m89	MARA	I have no future husband.
L281921	u1327	m89	CONOR	I'm your future husband, remember?
L282549	u1327	m89	CONOR	Do you have cause to bothering us?
L282548	u1337	m89	KATHERINE	David.
L282546	u1337	m89	KATHERINE	Kiss me.
L282545	u1327	m89	CONOR	Far away.
L282544	u1337	m89	KATHERINE	That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
L282543	u1327	m89	CONOR	Like you.
L282542	u1337	m89	KATHERINE	Something pretty.
L282541	u1327	m89	CONOR	What would you like?
L282540	u1337	m89	KATHERINE	Oh please.  Another one.
L282502	u1330	m89	DUPONT	So sure?
L282501	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
L282500	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Finish yours?
L282499	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Finish your prayers?
L282498	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Romirez is dust.
L282497	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Romirez understood.  Not you.
L282496	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
L282495	u1330	m89	DUPONT	You're wrong.
L282494	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
L282493	u1330	m89	DUPONT	No doubt.
L282492	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
L282491	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Not so scared.
L282489	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	It's all we have.
L282488	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Tradition.
L282487	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	State of grace and all that.
L282485	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Certainly not me.
L282484	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Who am I deceiving?
L282456	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Not likely.
L282455	u1342	m89	MAJOR	Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
L282454	u1342	m89	MAJOR	Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
L282453	u1330	m89	DUPONT	We need more time.
L282452	u1342	m89	MAJOR	I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
L282451	u1330	m89	DUPONT	They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
L282450	u1342	m89	MAJOR	Complete your inspection?
L282483	u1330	m89	DUPONT	I had no choice.
L282482	u1348	m89	MULET	You see Major?  You are not so different...
L282479	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Either you are with me or against me.
L282478	u1348	m89	MULET	You are really going to force this, aren't you?
L282477	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Do not turn your back on me.
L282476	u1348	m89	MULET	"Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  ""Threaten you""?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for."
L282475	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Don't threaten me, Private.
L282474	u1348	m89	MULET	Stay out of it.
L282473	u1330	m89	DUPONT	We must talk.
L282472	u1348	m89	MULET	It never changes, Major.
L282471	u1330	m89	DUPONT	It can be different.  It must be.
L282470	u1348	m89	MULET	"Help?  I've seen others ""help"". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter."
L282469	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
L282468	u1348	m89	MULET	We have no understanding.
L282467	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Wait.  I think we understand each other.
L282466	u1348	m89	MULET	If you wish to play games, Major.
L282465	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Equals?
L282464	u1348	m89	MULET	"Excuse me, ""sir"".  I thought we spoke as equals."
L282463	u1330	m89	DUPONT	I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
L282462	u1348	m89	MULET	You seem to understand a great deal.
L282461	u1330	m89	DUPONT	I understand you joined up in Bremen.
L282460	u1348	m89	MULET	Second musketeer.
L282459	u1330	m89	DUPONT	What is your position?
L282458	u1348	m89	MULET	Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
L282457	u1330	m89	DUPONT	I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
L282448	u1348	m89	MULET	Mulet.
L282447	u1330	m89	DUPONT	Your name?
L281835	u1332	m89	FATHER	He's a MacLeod.
L281834	u1346	m89	MOTHER	But Ian, he's still but a boy.
L281833	u1332	m89	FATHER	Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
L281832	u1346	m89	MOTHER	Must he go?
L281831	u1332	m89	FATHER	Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
L281829	u1346	m89	MOTHER	Have you time for some- thing to eat?
L281828	u1332	m89	FATHER	Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
L282518	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Yes, he was.
L282517	u1333	m89	GRANDSON	Your father must be smart.
L282516	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	My father taught me.
L282515	u1333	m89	GRANDSON	Where did you learn that?
L282514	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
L282512	u1333	m89	GRANDSON	Thanks.
L282511	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
L282665	u1345	m89	MORAN	No.  I want this to be all ours.
L282664	u1334	m89	INSPECTOR	Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
L282663	u1345	m89	MORAN	Round up who you can and put them on standby.
L282662	u1334	m89	INSPECTOR	Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
L282661	u1345	m89	MORAN	Are you sure?
L282428	u1334	m89	INSPECTOR	You'd think he'd had practice.
L282427	u1345	m89	MORAN	Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
L282426	u1334	m89	INSPECTOR	Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
L282425	u1345	m89	MORAN	Any other I.D.s come up?
L282424	u1334	m89	INSPECTOR	We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
L282423	u1345	m89	MORAN	Yeah.
L282422	u1334	m89	INSPECTOR	Figure she's with him?
L282421	u1345	m89	MORAN	I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
L282015	u1335	m89	INTRUDER	We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
L282014	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	_Answer_ me.
L282013	u1335	m89	INTRUDER	None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
L282012	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	He knows I'm here.  How?
L282011	u1335	m89	INTRUDER	He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
L282010	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	And the Bulgarian?
L282009	u1335	m89	INTRUDER	The last four.
L282008	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	How many came?
L282007	u1335	m89	INTRUDER	Smith.  Carl Smith.
L282006	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	What name is he using?
L282005	u1335	m89	INTRUDER	I don't know.
L282004	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Where!
L282258	u1336	m89	KAHN	You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
L282257	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You're wrong.
L282256	u1336	m89	KAHN	The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
L282255	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I've had a few more concerns.
L282254	u1336	m89	KAHN	Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
L282253	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
L282252	u1336	m89	KAHN	No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
L282251	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You're insane.
L282250	u1336	m89	KAHN	I knew his great-grandfather.
L282249	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You were never a kid.
L282248	u1336	m89	KAHN	I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
L282246	u1336	m89	KAHN	-Since you last saw me.
L282245	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I haven't drunk this much since-
L282244	u1336	m89	KAHN	He always did.
L282243	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	He found us even there.
L282242	u1336	m89	KAHN	Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
L282241	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
L282240	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Offered the Pope one of his whores.
L282239	u1336	m89	KAHN	But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
L282238	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
L282237	u1336	m89	KAHN	"I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his ""heretic stronghold"" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich."
L282234	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	It's good to see you, Kahn.
L282233	u1336	m89	KAHN	Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
L282232	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	And have you something to settle with me?
L282231	u1336	m89	KAHN	It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
L282230	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	What are you doing here?
L282229	u1336	m89	KAHN	Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
L282228	u1336	m89	KAHN	How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
L282227	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	How did you find me?
L282226	u1336	m89	KAHN	Head still secure to the neck.
L282225	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	How are you?
L282224	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Sit.
L282223	u1336	m89	KAHN	Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
L282222	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Kahn?
L282221	u1336	m89	KAHN	Spare a chair?
L282704	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Get up.
L282703	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Leave her alone.
L282702	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
L282701	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Go to hell.
L282700	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	It's all we have.
L282699	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Tradition.
L282698	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
L282697	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
L282696	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	This isn't done.  Get up.
L282695	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	What's the point?
L282687	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	As you wish.
L282686	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Leave her out of this.
L282685	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
L282112	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	MACLEOD!
L282111	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Run!
L282103	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	I do hope she enjoys a good show.
L282102	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Of sorts.
L282101	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Friend of yours?
L282100	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
L282099	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	You've been here from the start.
L282098	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Not so long.
L282097	u1339	m89	KNIGHT	Long time.
L282679	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Should I care?
L282678	u1340	m89	KNIGHT'S VOICE	Yes laddie, I have her.
L282677	u1340	m89	KNIGHT'S VOICE	Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
L282676	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	And if I refuse?
L282675	u1340	m89	KNIGHT'S VOICE	I want you to come to me.
L282674	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Are you here?
L282673	u1340	m89	KNIGHT'S VOICE	We have some unfinished business.
L282078	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
L282077	u1345	m89	MORAN	All I need is time.
L282076	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Do you?
L282075	u1345	m89	MORAN	Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
L282074	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	He's mistaken.
L282073	u1345	m89	MORAN	A neighbor saw your car leave.
L282072	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Home.
L282071	u1345	m89	MORAN	Where were you Tuesday night?
L282070	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	My condolences.
L281911	u1345	m89	MORAN	For the moment.
L281910	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	A mystery.
L281909	u1345	m89	MORAN	It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
L281908	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Your murder weapon?
L281907	u1345	m89	MORAN	A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
L281906	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I presume it's a sword.
L281905	u1345	m89	MORAN	Do you know what this is?
L281904	u1345	m89	MORAN	You're wrong.
L281903	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	That's none of your business.
L281902	u1345	m89	MORAN	What were _you_ looking for?
L281901	u1345	m89	MORAN	Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
L281900	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	What are you getting at?
L281899	u1345	m89	MORAN	Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
L281898	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	American.
L281897	u1345	m89	MORAN	Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
L281896	u1345	m89	MORAN	He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
L281895	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	It doesn't.
L281894	u1345	m89	MORAN	His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
L281893	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	No.
L281892	u1345	m89	MORAN	Did you know the victim?
L281891	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
L281890	u1345	m89	MORAN	Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
L281889	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Yes.
L281888	u1345	m89	MORAN	This your present address?
L281919	u1346	m89	MOTHER	They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
L281918	u1353	m89	TRAVELLER	But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
L281917	u1346	m89	MOTHER	Steven, Conor didn't die.
L281916	u1353	m89	TRAVELLER	I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
L281915	u1346	m89	MOTHER	You're a kind man to be sure.
L281914	u1353	m89	TRAVELLER	I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
L281913	u1346	m89	MOTHER	Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
L282581	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	Just your pappy scared some.
L282580	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Nothing to be sorry about.
L282510	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	I'm sure that's true.
L282509	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
L282508	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	No.
L282507	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
L282506	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	Same.
L282505	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	Morning Mr. North
L282211	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	I'll send them right up.
L282210	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	When may I expect the cleaners?
L282209	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	The resemblance is amazing.
L282208	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	We were very close.
L282207	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
L282206	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	His only kid.
L282205	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	You're one of William's kids, huh?
L282203	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	Oh yes, more than enough.
L282202	u1351	m89	TAUPIN	The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
L282201	u1347	m89	MR. NORTH	When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
L300004	u1460	m98	SALLAH	The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
L300003	u1452	m98	BRODY	May we go home now, please?
L299639	u1452	m98	BRODY	Did you say...? Uh, uh...
L299638	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
L299637	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes.
L299635	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Papers, sir. Got it here.
L299634	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes.
L299630	u1460	m98	SALLAH	There is no museum in Iskenderun.
L299629	u1452	m98	BRODY	My reputation precedes me.
L299627	u1460	m98	SALLAH	And I am his.
L299626	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
L299623	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
L299622	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
L299621	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
L299620	u1460	m98	SALLAH	You are on your own?
L299619	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
L299618	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
L299617	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
L299952	u1457	m98	INDY	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
L299951	u1452	m98	BRODY	Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
L299475	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm going after Dad.
L299474	u1452	m98	BRODY	What about you?
L299473	u1457	m98	INDY	Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
L299472	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes. Now we know.
L299471	u1457	m98	INDY	Alexandretta. Now we know.
L299470	u1452	m98	BRODY	Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
L299468	u1452	m98	BRODY	Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
L299467	u1457	m98	INDY	"The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. ""Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.""  But where exactly?"
L299465	u1452	m98	BRODY	"It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. ""Alexandretta?"" Hmmm..."
L299464	u1457	m98	INDY	How's the head?
L299385	u1452	m98	BRODY	Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
L299384	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad was onto something here!
L299383	u1452	m98	BRODY	Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
L299381	u1452	m98	BRODY	Where?
L299380	u1457	m98	INDY	Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
L299376	u1452	m98	BRODY	It looks like a converted church.
L299375	u1457	m98	INDY	That doesn't look much like a library.
L299350	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
L299349	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
L299348	u1457	m98	INDY	Ah, Venice...
L299341	u1452	m98	BRODY	I'll tell him we'll take two.
L299340	u1457	m98	INDY	Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
L299339	u1452	m98	BRODY	But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
L299338	u1452	m98	BRODY	The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
L299337	u1457	m98	INDY	Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
L299336	u1457	m98	INDY	Do you believe, Marcus?
L299335	u1452	m98	BRODY	I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
L299334	u1457	m98	INDY	It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
L299333	u1452	m98	BRODY	What is it?
L299332	u1457	m98	INDY	Venice, Italy!
L299330	u1452	m98	BRODY	It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
L299329	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad?
L299328	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
L299327	u1452	m98	BRODY	What has the old fool got himself into now?
L299282	u1452	m98	BRODY	Yes. My treat.
L299281	u1457	m98	INDY	Your treat.
L299279	u1452	m98	BRODY	Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
L299278	u1457	m98	INDY	All my life!
L299277	u1452	m98	BRODY	All your life.
L299276	u1457	m98	INDY	You know how long I've been looking for that?!
L299275	u1452	m98	BRODY	You've got it!
L299274	u1457	m98	INDY	Marcus!  I did it!
L300009	u1456	m98	HENRY	Got lost in his own museum, huh?
L300008	u1452	m98	BRODY	Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
L299942	u1456	m98	HENRY	The Name of God...
L299941	u1452	m98	BRODY	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
L299940	u1456	m98	HENRY	The Word of God...
L299890	u1456	m98	HENRY	It's war.
L299889	u1452	m98	BRODY	Look what you did!
L299888	u1452	m98	BRODY	But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
L299887	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299886	u1452	m98	BRODY	Henry, the pen --
L299862	u1456	m98	HENRY	It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
L299861	u1452	m98	BRODY	Henry! What are you doing here?!
L299858	u1452	m98	BRODY	Arghhh! Oh!
L299857	u1456	m98	HENRY	Marcus!
L299836	u1452	m98	BRODY	You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
L299835	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
L299833	u1452	m98	BRODY	I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
L299832	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
L299346	u1452	m98	BRODY	Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
L299345	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
L299344	u1452	m98	BRODY	Schneider?
L299343	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
L299342	u1452	m98	BRODY	Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
L299511	u1457	m98	INDY	How dare he?!
L299510	u1453	m98	BUTLER	This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
L299509	u1457	m98	INDY	Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
L299508	u1453	m98	BUTLER	Tapestries?
L299507	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
L299506	u1453	m98	BUTLER	Are you expected?
L299935	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	We're through!
L299934	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm through!
L299918	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
L299917	u1457	m98	INDY	Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
L299916	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
L299915	u1457	m98	INDY	As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
L299914	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
L299602	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
L299601	u1457	m98	INDY	DONOVAN!
L299322	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
L299321	u1457	m98	INDY	You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
L299320	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
L299319	u1457	m98	INDY	Yes?
L299318	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	You could be more right than you know.
L299317	u1457	m98	INDY	That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
L299316	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	"This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two ""markers"" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those ""markers."" It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second ""marker"" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away."
L299315	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	"Not ""supposedly,"" Doctor Jones."
L299314	u1457	m98	INDY	I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
L299313	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	"Let me tell you another ""bedtime story,"" Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact."
L299312	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
L299311	u1457	m98	INDY	What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
L299310	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
L299306	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
L299305	u1457	m98	INDY	An old man's dream.
L299304	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
L299303	u1457	m98	INDY	The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
L299302	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
L299301	u1457	m98	INDY	Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.
L299298	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
L299297	u1457	m98	INDY	Where did this come from?
L299296	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	That was our assessment as well.
L299295	u1457	m98	INDY	Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
L299294	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
L299293	u1457	m98	INDY	I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
L299292	u1454	m98	DONOVAN	My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
L299985	u1455	m98	ELSA	I can reach it. I can reach it...
L299984	u1457	m98	INDY	Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
L299982	u1457	m98	INDY	Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
L299981	u1455	m98	ELSA	It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
L299980	u1457	m98	INDY	Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
L299912	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
L299911	u1455	m98	ELSA	I never expected to see you again.
L299745	u1455	m98	ELSA	All I have to do is scream.
L299744	u1457	m98	INDY	All I have to do is squeeze.
L299743	u1455	m98	ELSA	You do.
L299742	u1457	m98	INDY	Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
L299741	u1455	m98	ELSA	Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
L299740	u1457	m98	INDY	My father didn't want it incinerated.
L299739	u1455	m98	ELSA	You came back for the book? Why?
L299738	u1457	m98	INDY	Where is it? I want it.
L299737	u1455	m98	ELSA	How did you get here?
L299606	u1457	m98	INDY	So it did.
L299605	u1455	m98	ELSA	This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
L299514	u1455	m98	ELSA	How do you know?
L299513	u1457	m98	INDY	This one. I think he's in here.
L299502	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't know. Think of something.
L299501	u1455	m98	ELSA	What are you going to do?
L299500	u1455	m98	ELSA	I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
L299499	u1457	m98	INDY	What do you know about this place?
L299493	u1455	m98	ELSA	It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
L299492	u1457	m98	INDY	No. You like the way I do things.
L299491	u1455	m98	ELSA	No?
L299490	u1457	m98	INDY	Knock it off. You're not mad.
L299489	u1455	m98	ELSA	Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
L299488	u1457	m98	INDY	At least I let you tag along.
L299486	u1455	m98	ELSA	You had it? You didn't trust me!
L299485	u1457	m98	INDY	Uh-huh.
L299484	u1455	m98	ELSA	The Grail Diary.
L299483	u1457	m98	INDY	This.
L299482	u1455	m98	ELSA	What were they looking for?
L299481	u1457	m98	INDY	Mine, too.
L299480	u1455	m98	ELSA	My room!
L299442	u1457	m98	INDY	I said don't go between them!
L299441	u1455	m98	ELSA	You said go between them!
L299440	u1457	m98	INDY	I said go around!
L299434	u1455	m98	ELSA	What?
L299433	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't wander off.
L299429	u1457	m98	INDY	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
L299428	u1455	m98	ELSA	Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
L299426	u1457	m98	INDY	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
L299425	u1455	m98	ELSA	What's that?
L299422	u1455	m98	ELSA	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
L299421	u1457	m98	INDY	It must be one of these...
L299413	u1457	m98	INDY	Pretty sure.
L299412	u1455	m98	ELSA	Are you sure?
L299411	u1457	m98	INDY	The Ark of the Covenant.
L299407	u1455	m98	ELSA	The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
L299406	u1457	m98	INDY	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
L299405	u1455	m98	ELSA	Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
L299402	u1455	m98	ELSA	Lower me down.
L299401	u1457	m98	INDY	Except he's lost, and I'm not.
L299400	u1455	m98	ELSA	You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
L299399	u1457	m98	INDY	Bingo.
L299387	u1455	m98	ELSA	Find something?
L299386	u1457	m98	INDY	My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
L299369	u1457	m98	INDY	Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
L299368	u1455	m98	ELSA	But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
L299367	u1457	m98	INDY	It would make me very happy.
L299366	u1455	m98	ELSA	In that case, I permit you.
L299365	u1457	m98	INDY	I usually don't either.
L299364	u1455	m98	ELSA	I usually don't.
L299363	u1457	m98	INDY	Fraulein -- will you permit me?
L299362	u1457	m98	INDY	Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
L299361	u1455	m98	ELSA	The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
L299356	u1455	m98	ELSA	Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
L299355	u1457	m98	INDY	And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
L299353	u1455	m98	ELSA	I knew it was you --
L299352	u1457	m98	INDY	Yes?
L299351	u1455	m98	ELSA	Doctor Jones?
L300012	u1457	m98	INDY	Yes, sir!  Haaa!
L300011	u1456	m98	HENRY	After you, Junior.
L300010	u1457	m98	INDY	Uh-huh.
L300007	u1456	m98	HENRY	Ready.
L300006	u1457	m98	INDY	Ready?
L300002	u1456	m98	HENRY	We named the dog Indiana.
L300001	u1457	m98	INDY	I like Indiana.
L299998	u1457	m98	INDY	Junior?! Dad...
L299997	u1456	m98	HENRY	What did you find, Junior?
L299996	u1456	m98	HENRY	Me?... Illumination.
L299995	u1457	m98	INDY	What did you find, Dad?
L299994	u1456	m98	HENRY	Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
L299989	u1457	m98	INDY	I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
L299988	u1456	m98	HENRY	Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
L299945	u1457	m98	INDY	J.
L299944	u1456	m98	HENRY	"But in the Latin alphabet, ""Jehovah"" begins with an ""I""."
L299932	u1457	m98	INDY	The penitent man is humble...
L299931	u1456	m98	HENRY	Penitent. Penitent...
L299930	u1457	m98	INDY	The penitent man is humble before God.
L299929	u1456	m98	HENRY	The penitent man. The penitent...
L299928	u1457	m98	INDY	The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
L299927	u1456	m98	HENRY	Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass.
L299920	u1456	m98	HENRY	Junior...
L299919	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad?!
L299894	u1457	m98	INDY	Get out of there, Dad!
L299893	u1456	m98	HENRY	You call this archaeology?
L299892	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad?
L299849	u1457	m98	INDY	Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
L299848	u1456	m98	HENRY	Now, who are all these people?
L299839	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, we're well out of range.
L299838	u1456	m98	HENRY	What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
L299810	u1457	m98	INDY	This could be close.
L299809	u1456	m98	HENRY	This is intolerable!
L299808	u1457	m98	INDY	It happens to me all the time.
L299807	u1456	m98	HENRY	It's a new experience for me.
L299806	u1457	m98	INDY	I know, Dad!
L299805	u1456	m98	HENRY	Those people are trying to kill us!
L299804	u1457	m98	INDY	Thanks.
L299803	u1456	m98	HENRY	Nice landing.
L299801	u1456	m98	HENRY	More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
L299800	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, are we hit?!
L299798	u1456	m98	HENRY	What happens at eleven o'clock?
L299797	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
L299794	u1457	m98	INDY	Fly... yes. Land... no.
L299793	u1456	m98	HENRY	I didn't know you could fly a plane.
L299789	u1456	m98	HENRY	I don't know. We'll find out.
L299788	u1457	m98	INDY	What does that mean?
L299787	u1456	m98	HENRY	"Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  ""First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."""
L299786	u1457	m98	INDY	Well... I can't think of anything.
L299784	u1456	m98	HENRY	Very well. I'm here now.
L299783	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, how can you?
L299782	u1456	m98	HENRY	You left just when you were becoming interesting.
L299781	u1457	m98	INDY	What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
L299780	u1456	m98	HENRY	Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
L299779	u1457	m98	INDY	When?
L299778	u1456	m98	HENRY	Actually, I was a wonderful father.
L299777	u1457	m98	INDY	A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
L299776	u1456	m98	HENRY	And do I detect a rebuke?
L299775	u1457	m98	INDY	We didn't talk. We never talked.
L299774	u1456	m98	HENRY	Hmmm... What did we talk about?
L299773	u1457	m98	INDY	Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
L299772	u1456	m98	HENRY	Ships that pass in the night...
L299771	u1457	m98	INDY	I was the next man.
L299770	u1456	m98	HENRY	Well, I'm as human as the next man.
L299769	u1457	m98	INDY	That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
L299768	u1456	m98	HENRY	You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
L299752	u1457	m98	INDY	Relax.
L299751	u1456	m98	HENRY	When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
L299749	u1456	m98	HENRY	Good.
L299748	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
L299747	u1456	m98	HENRY	What did you get?
L299734	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
L299733	u1457	m98	INDY	This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
L299732	u1456	m98	HENRY	That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
L299731	u1457	m98	INDY	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
L299730	u1456	m98	HENRY	Marcus would agree with me.
L299729	u1457	m98	INDY	What about Marcus?
L299728	u1456	m98	HENRY	Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
L299727	u1457	m98	INDY	Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
L299726	u1456	m98	HENRY	I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
L299725	u1457	m98	INDY	But what are they? Can't you remember?
L299724	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
L299723	u1457	m98	INDY	Booby traps?
L299722	u1456	m98	HENRY	Three devices of such lethal cunning.
L299721	u1457	m98	INDY	What final challenge?
L299720	u1456	m98	HENRY	Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
L299719	u1457	m98	INDY	All right Dad -- tell me.
L299718	u1456	m98	HENRY	There is more in the Diary than just the map.
L299717	u1457	m98	INDY	You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
L299716	u1456	m98	HENRY	My Diary's in Berlin.
L299715	u1457	m98	INDY	Brody's this way.
L299714	u1456	m98	HENRY	You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
L299713	u1456	m98	HENRY	Stop! Stop!
L299712	u1457	m98	INDY	What?
L299711	u1456	m98	HENRY	Stop!
L299707	u1456	m98	HENRY	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
L299706	u1457	m98	INDY	Come on, Dad. Come on!
L299702	u1456	m98	HENRY	...the solution presents itself.
L299701	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299695	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm out, Dad!
L299694	u1456	m98	HENRY	This is intolerable!
L299687	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh.
L299686	u1457	m98	INDY	Head for the fireplace!
L299685	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299684	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299683	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299682	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299681	u1456	m98	HENRY	What?
L299680	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299675	u1457	m98	INDY	All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
L299674	u1456	m98	HENRY	And the chair.
L299673	u1457	m98	INDY	What???
L299672	u1456	m98	HENRY	The floor's on fire! See?!
L299671	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
L299670	u1456	m98	HENRY	I ought to tell you something.
L299668	u1457	m98	INDY	Try and burn through the ropes.
L299667	u1456	m98	HENRY	Feels like a cigarette lighter.
L299666	u1457	m98	INDY	My lucky charm.
L299665	u1456	m98	HENRY	What am I looking for?
L299663	u1457	m98	INDY	Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
L299662	u1456	m98	HENRY	You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
L299661	u1457	m98	INDY	Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
L299660	u1456	m98	HENRY	So did I.
L299659	u1457	m98	INDY	Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
L299598	u1456	m98	HENRY	She talks in her sleep.
L299597	u1457	m98	INDY	How did you she was a Nazi?
L299596	u1456	m98	HENRY	Umh?
L299595	u1457	m98	INDY	She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
L299587	u1456	m98	HENRY	Don't worry. He won't.
L299586	u1457	m98	INDY	No! Don't Shoot!
L299571	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
L299570	u1457	m98	INDY	I came here to save you.
L299569	u1456	m98	HENRY	Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
L299568	u1457	m98	INDY	Will you take it easy!
L299567	u1456	m98	HENRY	I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
L299566	u1457	m98	INDY	Look, can we discuss this later?
L299565	u1456	m98	HENRY	You did!!
L299564	u1457	m98	INDY	Well, uh...
L299563	u1456	m98	HENRY	You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
L299554	u1457	m98	INDY	Yeah?
L299553	u1456	m98	HENRY	They want my diary.
L299552	u1457	m98	INDY	Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
L299551	u1456	m98	HENRY	Rats?
L299550	u1457	m98	INDY	There were rats, Dad.
L299549	u1456	m98	HENRY	If only I could have been with you.
L299548	u1457	m98	INDY	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
L299547	u1456	m98	HENRY	...you did it.
L299546	u1456	m98	HENRY	Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
L299545	u1457	m98	INDY	Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
L299544	u1456	m98	HENRY	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
L299543	u1457	m98	INDY	Well, what was left of him.
L299542	u1456	m98	HENRY	He was actually there? You saw him?
L299541	u1457	m98	INDY	Found it.
L299540	u1456	m98	HENRY	I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
L299539	u1457	m98	INDY	Right.
L299538	u1456	m98	HENRY	Through the library?
L299537	u1457	m98	INDY	I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
L299536	u1456	m98	HENRY	Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
L299534	u1456	m98	HENRY	Good point.
L299533	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad, they come in through the doors.
L299532	u1456	m98	HENRY	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
L299531	u1457	m98	INDY	No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
L299529	u1456	m98	HENRY	Thank God!
L299528	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
L299527	u1456	m98	HENRY	I'll never forgive myself --
L299526	u1457	m98	INDY	And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
L299525	u1456	m98	HENRY	Oh, it breaks the heart.
L299523	u1457	m98	INDY	I came to get you! What do you think?
L299522	u1456	m98	HENRY	But what are you doing here?
L299521	u1457	m98	INDY	Don't call me that, please.
L299520	u1456	m98	HENRY	It is you Junior!
L299246	u1456	m98	HENRY	Junior!
L299245	u1457	m98	INDY	No, Dad. You listen to me --
L299244	u1456	m98	HENRY	Then wait -- count to twenty.
L299243	u1457	m98	INDY	It's important!
L299242	u1456	m98	HENRY	Out!
L299241	u1457	m98	INDY	Dad!
L299961	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
L299960	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
L299959	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
L299958	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	A long time to wait.
L299957	u1457	m98	INDY	That was seven hundred years ago.
L299956	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
L299955	u1457	m98	INDY	Who are you?
L299954	u1459	m98	KNIGHT	I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
L299876	u1460	m98	SALLAH	They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
L299875	u1457	m98	INDY	Where's my father?
L299874	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
L299873	u1457	m98	INDY	Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
L299854	u1457	m98	INDY	No camels!
L299853	u1460	m98	SALLAH	But, Indy --
L299852	u1457	m98	INDY	I don't need camels.
L299851	u1460	m98	SALLAH	I'll take the camels.
L299850	u1457	m98	INDY	I'm going after those horses.
L299841	u1457	m98	INDY	Come on -- come on!
L299840	u1460	m98	SALLAH	That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
L299829	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
L299828	u1457	m98	INDY	What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
L299827	u1460	m98	SALLAH	Get that camel out of the way!
L299463	u1458	m98	KAZIM	In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
L299462	u1457	m98	INDY	I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
L299461	u1458	m98	KAZIM	Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
L299459	u1458	m98	KAZIM	The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
L299458	u1457	m98	INDY	And why were you trying to kill me?
L299457	u1458	m98	KAZIM	My name is Kazim.
L299456	u1457	m98	INDY	Who are you?
L299455	u1458	m98	KAZIM	If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
L299454	u1457	m98	INDY	All right! Where's my father
L299453	u1458	m98	KAZIM	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
L299452	u1457	m98	INDY	This is your last chance.
L299451	u1458	m98	KAZIM	My soul is prepared. How's yours?
L299450	u1457	m98	INDY	Then we'll die.
L299449	u1458	m98	KAZIM	If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
L299448	u1457	m98	INDY	Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
L299447	u1458	m98	KAZIM	No.
L299446	u1457	m98	INDY	My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
L299445	u1458	m98	KAZIM	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
L299444	u1457	m98	INDY	Why are you trying to kill us?
L338835	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338834	u1715	m113	LYSSA	That's a better one.
L338820	u1715	m113	LYSSA	That way. I can feel the cold.
L338819	u1712	m113	COLWYN	In the Arctic ice.
L338791	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
L338790	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ...
L338787	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I knew you would come.
L338786	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
L338785	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Yes.
L338782	u1715	m113	LYSSA	All directions are the same here.
L338781	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Take the western passage.
L338778	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
L338777	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't know how.
L338776	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Will your power outward.
L338772	u1715	m113	LYSSA	All the passages are guarded.
L338771	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You must move away from the Center.
L338770	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn ...
L338385	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
L338384	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
L338383	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I know it.
L338382	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will find you. I will be with you.
L338381	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
L338380	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Where is the Fortress?
L338379	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn ...
L338378	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ...
L338281	u1715	m113	LYSSA	In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
L338280	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
L338278	u1715	m113	LYSSA	No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
L338277	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Have they harmed you?
L338276	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Colwyn.
L338275	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
L338216	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I can't wait either.
L338215	u1715	m113	LYSSA	About what?
L338214	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I lied.
L338213	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I can't.
L338212	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Thank you, but I can wait.
L338211	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
L338210	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
L338209	u1715	m113	LYSSA	There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
L338204	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Never mind my ears! Go away!
L338203	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
L338188	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
L338187	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We're not married <u>yet</u>.
L338186	u1715	m113	LYSSA	We're almost married.
L338185	u1712	m113	COLWYN	<u>What</u>?
L338184	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
L338183	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I have no intention of getting used to it.
L338182	u1712	m113	COLWYN	If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
L338181	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
L338180	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Well, you're beautiful.
L338179	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
L338178	u1712	m113	COLWYN	That's worse.
L338177	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
L338176	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
L338175	u1715	m113	LYSSA	Me too.
L338174	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
L338173	u1715	m113	LYSSA	You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
L338172	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't have to go through with it either.
L338171	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
L338236	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
L338235	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
L338234	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
L338233	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I won't leave you here.
L338232	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You will go alone.
L338230	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
L338229	u1712	m113	COLWYN	They have Lyssa!
L338219	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Of course it was.
L338218	u1712	m113	COLWYN	It was a platonic kiss, Father.
L338217	u1721	m113	TUROLD	You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
L338804	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I forbid you!
L338803	u1725	m113	YNYR	I can. Because I choose it.
L338802	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No! You cannot know that!
L338801	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
L338800	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You're coming with us.
L338799	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
L338798	u1725	m113	YNYR	Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
L338797	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
L338796	u1725	m113	YNYR	Use your sword.
L338795	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She can see the Beast!
L338794	u1725	m113	YNYR	I chose the wrong passage.
L338793	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
L338784	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Where the spiral begins.
L338783	u1725	m113	YNYR	The spiral begins in the west.
L338774	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
L338773	u1725	m113	YNYR	She must make a glaive.
L338768	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
L338767	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The Beast will kill her.
L338766	u1725	m113	YNYR	They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
L338721	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Let us wish him peace.
L338720	u1725	m113	YNYR	He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
L338560	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
L338559	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You will tell me her name and we will go together.
L338558	u1725	m113	YNYR	From here, I must go alone.
L338551	u1725	m113	YNYR	He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
L338550	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
L338548	u1725	m113	YNYR	He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
L338547	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
L338525	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.
L338524	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
L338523	u1725	m113	YNYR	You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
L338522	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Never.
L338521	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. She must agree of her own free will.
L338520	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Can she be forced?
L338519	u1725	m113	YNYR	Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
L338518	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
L338517	u1725	m113	YNYR	He has come for Lyssa.
L338516	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338515	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
L338514	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
L338458	u1725	m113	YNYR	You will know, in good time.
L338457	u1712	m113	COLWYN	But you suspect.
L338456	u1725	m113	YNYR	I'm not sure.
L338455	u1712	m113	COLWYN	<u>Why</u>?
L338454	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
L338453	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
L338450	u1725	m113	YNYR	She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
L338449	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot reach her.
L338390	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I will find her!
L338389	u1725	m113	YNYR	The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
L338388	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
L338387	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
L338386	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
L338377	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
L338376	u1725	m113	YNYR	What do you see?
L338375	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I can't reach her.
L338367	u1725	m113	YNYR	Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
L338366	u1712	m113	COLWYN	They know when they're going to die?
L338325	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
L338324	u1725	m113	YNYR	You choose these?
L338294	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
L338293	u1725	m113	YNYR	You have not slept in two days.
L338292	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
L338291	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
L338290	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
L338289	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
L338288	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The Fortress moves?
L338287	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
L338286	u1712	m113	COLWYN	She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
L338285	u1725	m113	YNYR	You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
L338274	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
L338273	u1725	m113	YNYR	Reach out farther. Call to her.
L338272	u1712	m113	COLWYN	There is nothing.
L338269	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You won't have to.
L338268	u1725	m113	YNYR	I am too old to climb down a rope.
L338267	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have rope?
L338266	u1725	m113	YNYR	But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
L338264	u1712	m113	COLWYN	But there is another entrance to this place.
L338263	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is no other way.
L338262	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
L338261	u1725	m113	YNYR	With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
L338259	u1712	m113	COLWYN	In the old books. It's called a glaive.
L338258	u1725	m113	YNYR	Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
L338257	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I have no extraordinary powers.
L338256	u1725	m113	YNYR	This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
L338254	u1725	m113	YNYR	I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
L338253	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
L338252	u1725	m113	YNYR	Turold's son was to marry her.
L338251	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The new Queen lives.
L338250	u1725	m113	YNYR	Does the Queen live?
L338249	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The White Castle has fallen.
L338719	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Each to his fate.
L338718	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Each to his fate.
L338714	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Yes. It is today.
L338713	u1712	m113	COLWYN	It is today?
L338705	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Saddles.
L338704	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I road them often in my youth.
L338703	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You have done it?
L338702	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	They can be saddled.
L338542	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What will happen?
L338541	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Do not let the waters touch you.
L338537	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	We must enter the swamp.
L338536	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Slayers!
L338501	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
L338500	u1712	m113	COLWYN	How did you know?
L338689	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot.
L338688	u1722	m113	VELLA	You will not, then?
L338687	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
L338686	u1722	m113	VELLA	One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
L338685	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot betray my bride.
L338684	u1722	m113	VELLA	Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
L338683	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I cannot take comfort when she has none.
L338682	u1722	m113	VELLA	Let me comfort you.
L338681	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I ache with it.
L338680	u1722	m113	VELLA	You too are lonely.
L338668	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338667	u1722	m113	VELLA	Even by you?
L338666	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338665	u1722	m113	VELLA	Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
L338664	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Yes.
L338663	u1722	m113	VELLA	Am I not worth returning to?
L338662	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't think that.
L338661	u1722	m113	VELLA	Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
L338660	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I know the cruelty of such a fate.
L338576	u1714	m113	ERGO	What else is left for a man without friends.
L338575	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You and I will guard the fire.
L338574	u1714	m113	ERGO	Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
L338411	u1714	m113	ERGO	<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
L338410	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
L338408	u1714	m113	ERGO	No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
L338407	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I have need of friends.
L338406	u1714	m113	ERGO	My <u>friend</u>.
L338405	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I was hoping I might be your friend.
L338404	u1714	m113	ERGO	Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
L338371	u1712	m113	COLWYN	He saved our lives.
L338370	u1714	m113	ERGO	Once is enough, thank you.
L338309	u1714	m113	ERGO	Staying alive.
L338308	u1712	m113	COLWYN	What business?
L338307	u1714	m113	ERGO	I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
L338302	u1714	m113	ERGO	For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
L338301	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Perhaps he expected to eat it.
L338300	u1714	m113	ERGO	Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
L338299	u1712	m113	COLWYN	A forest near the Valley of Needles.
L338298	u1714	m113	ERGO	It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
L338297	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
L338296	u1714	m113	ERGO	Help! Help! I'm drowning!
L338824	u1712	m113	COLWYN	There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
L338823	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
L338822	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
L338744	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Perhaps. If the pay is good.
L338743	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
L338742	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
L338741	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Naturally.
L338740	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Subject to the King, no doubt.
L338739	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
L338723	u1712	m113	COLWYN	At the gallop!
L338722	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
L338701	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
L338700	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We could reach it on fire-mares.
L338573	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Yes, my lord.
L338572	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Go. I command you.
L338571	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
L338570	u1712	m113	COLWYN	The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
L338569	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	What kind of friend do you think I am?
L338568	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Go, join them.
L338557	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
L338556	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
L338484	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	A flicker of talent.
L338483	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Hand over your dinner.
L338482	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
L338481	u1712	m113	COLWYN	These we'll pay for.
L338480	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
L338479	u1712	m113	COLWYN	We must try to get horses.
L338478	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You've eaten nothing.
L338416	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
L338415	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Well, I'm not impressed.
L338394	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
L338393	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
L338352	u1712	m113	COLWYN	No.
L338351	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Not sleepy, either?
L338350	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I'm not hungry.
L338347	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
L338346	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
L338345	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I'm all right.
L338344	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	When did you last sleep, boy?
L338334	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
L338333	u1712	m113	COLWYN	That I promise you.
L338332	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	It should be an interesting journey, then.
L338331	u1712	m113	COLWYN	To the place where Death lives.
L338330	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	And where do you lead, boy?
L338329	u1712	m113	COLWYN	So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
L338328	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
L338327	u1712	m113	COLWYN	You will follow me.
L338326	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
L338323	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I know you.
L338322	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Hah! You don't know me, boy.
L338321	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
L338320	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	How did you know I had sons?
L338319	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Fame is what you leave to your sons.
L338318	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
L338317	u1712	m113	COLWYN	Fame.
L338316	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
L338315	u1712	m113	COLWYN	I don't think you'll grow careless.
L338716	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	And mine goes with you.
L338715	u1714	m113	ERGO	My heart stays here.
L338712	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I cannot go with you, my friend.
L338711	u1714	m113	ERGO	Quell?
L338632	u1714	m113	ERGO	And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
L338631	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	A small house.
L338630	u1714	m113	ERGO	A venison pie as big as a house.
L338566	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	No.
L338565	u1714	m113	ERGO	Can't I come, too?
L338564	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	We'll meet you at the inn.
L338563	u1714	m113	ERGO	Where are you going?
L338535	u1714	m113	ERGO	I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
L338534	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
L338533	u1714	m113	ERGO	What is that awful looking place?
L338467	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	I am Quell.
L338466	u1714	m113	ERGO	Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
L338465	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
L338464	u1714	m113	ERGO	You!
L338463	u1714	m113	ERGO	A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
L338462	u1713	m113	CYCLOPS	Would you settle for a boar?
L338461	u1714	m113	ERGO	Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
L338758	u1714	m113	ERGO	No, no. I'm with you, boy.
L338757	u1719	m113	TITCH	Would you desert your friends?
L338756	u1714	m113	ERGO	Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
L338634	u1714	m113	ERGO	And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
L338633	u1719	m113	TITCH	We meant only to please you.
L338629	u1719	m113	TITCH	It's right behind you.
L338628	u1714	m113	ERGO	Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
L338627	u1719	m113	TITCH	I don't think it's working.
L338626	u1714	m113	ERGO	What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
L338625	u1714	m113	ERGO	First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
L338624	u1719	m113	TITCH	Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
L338490	u1714	m113	ERGO	A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
L338489	u1719	m113	TITCH	I only want one.
L338488	u1714	m113	ERGO	One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
L338487	u1719	m113	TITCH	I'd wish for a puppy.
L338486	u1714	m113	ERGO	If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
L338469	u1714	m113	ERGO	Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
L338468	u1719	m113	TITCH	I'm hungry.
L338448	u1719	m113	TITCH	I ...  ... am Titch.
L338447	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
L338446	u1719	m113	TITCH	You can have half.
L338445	u1714	m113	ERGO	You do?
L338444	u1719	m113	TITCH	I have a cinnamon bar.
L338443	u1714	m113	ERGO	What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
L338442	u1719	m113	TITCH	No.
L338441	u1714	m113	ERGO	Sugarballs?
L338440	u1719	m113	TITCH	No.
L338439	u1714	m113	ERGO	Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
L338637	u1714	m113	ERGO	No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
L338636	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Look at its insides.
L338635	u1714	m113	ERGO	Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
L338554	u1714	m113	ERGO	Hush!
L338553	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I can't hold the weight of both of you!
L338477	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
L338476	u1714	m113	ERGO	The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
L338475	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Passable, pimple, very passable.
L338374	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Oh, my poor stomach.
L338373	u1714	m113	ERGO	Oh, my poor stew!
L338361	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
L338360	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am being exploited! Where are you going?
L338359	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
L338358	u1714	m113	ERGO	Food for crows.
L338357	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We have plenty of hares.
L338356	u1714	m113	ERGO	And do you think I live on air?
L338355	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
L338354	u1714	m113	ERGO	What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
L338342	u1714	m113	ERGO	I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
L338341	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	You had better manners as a pig.
L338340	u1714	m113	ERGO	Put me down, you lout!
L338312	u1714	m113	ERGO	Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
L338311	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
L338710	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. He will master the leader.
L338709	u1714	m113	ERGO	They'll trample him to death!
L338403	u1714	m113	ERGO	Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
L338402	u1725	m113	YNYR	He is the King.
L338401	u1714	m113	ERGO	And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
L338400	u1725	m113	YNYR	He didn't join them. They joined him.
L338365	u1725	m113	YNYR	If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
L338364	u1714	m113	ERGO	He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
L338363	u1725	m113	YNYR	The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
L338362	u1714	m113	ERGO	One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
L338306	u1714	m113	ERGO	<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
L338305	u1725	m113	YNYR	The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
L338304	u1714	m113	ERGO	My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
L338697	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	He will not come. You will be my queen.
L338696	u1715	m113	LYSSA	He will come for me.
L338679	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then he will die!
L338678	u1715	m113	LYSSA	He will not!
L338677	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
L338676	u1715	m113	LYSSA	It's a lie!
L338675	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	Then look!
L338674	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
L338653	u1723	m113	VOICE OF THE BEAST	You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
L338652	u1715	m113	LYSSA	I do not want your power. It is hideous.
L338208	u1716	m113	QUEEN	They will have the life that you and I might have had.
L338207	u1721	m113	TUROLD	A fine match.
L338206	u1716	m113	QUEEN	A match for your son, I think.
L338205	u1721	m113	TUROLD	A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
L338200	u1721	m113	TUROLD	That I am, my lady.
L338199	u1716	m113	QUEEN	You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
L338198	u1721	m113	TUROLD	I knew.
L338197	u1716	m113	QUEEN	I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
L338196	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Yes.
L338195	u1721	m113	TUROLD	It is important to assure the succession.
L338194	u1716	m113	QUEEN	For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
L338191	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
L338190	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
L338166	u1721	m113	TUROLD	We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
L338165	u1716	m113	QUEEN	It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
L338164	u1721	m113	TUROLD	The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
L338163	u1716	m113	QUEEN	It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
L338162	u1721	m113	TUROLD	It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
L338161	u1716	m113	QUEEN	Freylag's stronghold?
L338160	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
L338159	u1716	m113	QUEEN	What news from our friends?
L338193	u1721	m113	TUROLD	He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
L338192	u1717	m113	ROWAN	Modred! Impossible!
L338151	u1721	m113	TUROLD	We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
L338150	u1717	m113	ROWAN	Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
L338149	u1721	m113	TUROLD	How many did you lose?
L338148	u1717	m113	ROWAN	I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
L338147	u1717	m113	ROWAN	You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
L338146	u1721	m113	TUROLD	Yes. We lost five.
L338145	u1717	m113	ROWAN	You were attacked in the forest?
L338438	u1718	m113	SEER	They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
L338437	u1725	m113	YNYR	The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
L338429	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
L338428	u1718	m113	SEER	Can you see?
L338427	u1718	m113	SEER	I will seek the Fortress for you.
L338426	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is the time.
L338425	u1718	m113	SEER	Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
L338424	u1725	m113	YNYR	You know the voice.
L338423	u1718	m113	SEER	With an old voice?
L338422	u1725	m113	YNYR	The new King.
L338421	u1718	m113	SEER	Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
L338420	u1725	m113	YNYR	We seek the Fortress of Krull.
L338808	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	That is true.
L338807	u1725	m113	YNYR	Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
L338764	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is too late. He has drunk.
L338763	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Kegan!
L338736	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
L338735	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Look.
L338734	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is not necessary. They will not follow.
L338733	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
L338699	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	It's a hundred leagues from here.
L338698	u1725	m113	YNYR	We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
L338562	u1725	m113	YNYR	Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
L338561	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Each to his fate, lad.
L338539	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Fewer will survive them.
L338538	u1725	m113	YNYR	Few have survived it.
L338513	u1725	m113	YNYR	She had another name once.
L338512	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Her name is Death.
L338511	u1725	m113	YNYR	Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
L338510	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	She has the power to kill.
L338509	u1725	m113	YNYR	She has the power of vision.
L338508	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
L338507	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.
L338506	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	The Widow of the Web?
L338505	u1725	m113	YNYR	I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
L338452	u1725	m113	YNYR	Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
L338451	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	The leader of the Dark Ones?
L338397	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
L338396	u1725	m113	YNYR	Many have perished in that maze.
L338395	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
L338392	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
L338391	u1725	m113	YNYR	We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
L338369	u1725	m113	YNYR	No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
L338368	u1720	m113	TORQUIL	Knowledge I wouldn't want.
L338622	u1724	m113	WIDOW	There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
L338621	u1725	m113	YNYR	You will come with me.
L338620	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
L338619	u1725	m113	YNYR	I cannot stop the sand.
L338616	u1725	m113	YNYR	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
L338615	u1724	m113	WIDOW	It will not help.
L338614	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
L338613	u1725	m113	YNYR	A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
L338612	u1724	m113	WIDOW	No.
L338611	u1725	m113	YNYR	Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
L338610	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You lie!
L338609	u1725	m113	YNYR	There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
L338608	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Why must you know?
L338607	u1725	m113	YNYR	The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
L338606	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Of what?
L338605	u1725	m113	YNYR	Knowledge.
L338604	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
L338603	u1725	m113	YNYR	Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
L338602	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Yes.
L338601	u1725	m113	YNYR	You see?
L338600	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
L338599	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is no trickery.
L338598	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Do not try your trickery on me!
L338597	u1724	m113	WIDOW	I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
L338596	u1725	m113	YNYR	Where is he? My son.
L338595	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
L338594	u1725	m113	YNYR	You said nothing. You told me nothing.
L338593	u1724	m113	WIDOW	You had a son.
L338592	u1725	m113	YNYR	We had no children.
L338591	u1724	m113	WIDOW	She bore you many children?
L338590	u1725	m113	YNYR	No, she was not as beautiful.
L338589	u1724	m113	WIDOW	She was not as beautiful.
L338588	u1725	m113	YNYR	Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
L338587	u1724	m113	WIDOW	But you would not stay with me.
L338586	u1725	m113	YNYR	The most beautiful woman in the world.
L338585	u1724	m113	WIDOW	I was beautiful then.
L338584	u1725	m113	YNYR	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
L338583	u1724	m113	WIDOW	It is fifty years since I heard that name.
L338582	u1725	m113	YNYR	Ynyr!
L338581	u1724	m113	WIDOW	Who speaks that name!
L346420	u1782	m118	BARON	Purely a precaution...
L346419	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Fire moat... why do that?
L346418	u1782	m118	BARON	Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
L346417	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	We come watch... we come watch...
L346412	u1782	m118	BARON	I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
L346411	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	You go?  Not watch fun?
L346408	u1782	m118	BARON	Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
L346407	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Then we smash 'em?
L346406	u1782	m118	BARON	Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
L346385	u1782	m118	BARON	Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
L346384	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Fool's magic.
L346381	u1782	m118	BARON	Faith.
L346380	u1780	m118	1ST DEMON	Why so few?
L346416	u1782	m118	BARON	To finish last evening's delightful work.
L346415	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	You go to lady now?
L346414	u1782	m118	BARON	This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
L346413	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	More fun win battle?
L346410	u1782	m118	BARON	Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
L346409	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	We watch... good fun...
L346392	u1782	m118	BARON	I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
L346391	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	Birdies... pretty...
L346389	u1782	m118	BARON	No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
L346388	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	We go out, smash 'em now?
L346387	u1782	m118	BARON	Always.
L346386	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
L346383	u1782	m118	BARON	Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
L346382	u1781	m118	2ND DEMON	What?
L346490	u1782	m118	BARON	So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
L346489	u1788	m118	LILI	To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
L346488	u1782	m118	BARON	Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
L346487	u1788	m118	LILI	Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
L346486	u1782	m118	BARON	Or looked so beautiful...
L346485	u1788	m118	LILI	Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
L346484	u1782	m118	BARON	And, now?
L346483	u1788	m118	LILI	It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
L346482	u1782	m118	BARON	Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
L346481	u1788	m118	LILI	And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
L346480	u1782	m118	BARON	Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
L346479	u1788	m118	LILI	Might we watch, too?
L346478	u1782	m118	BARON	From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
L346477	u1788	m118	LILI	It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
L346476	u1782	m118	BARON	It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
L346475	u1788	m118	LILI	What was that?  Did you hear that?
L346350	u1782	m118	BARON	Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
L346349	u1788	m118	LILI	You're a beast!
L346348	u1782	m118	BARON	My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
L346347	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't expect you'd understand.
L346346	u1782	m118	BARON	Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
L346345	u1788	m118	LILI	Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
L346344	u1782	m118	BARON	I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
L346343	u1788	m118	LILI	I see...
L346342	u1782	m118	BARON	When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
L346341	u1788	m118	LILI	What will become of me then?
L346340	u1782	m118	BARON	Yes?
L346339	u1788	m118	LILI	And then?
L346338	u1782	m118	BARON	A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
L346337	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, yes...
L346336	u1782	m118	BARON	We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
L346335	u1782	m118	BARON	At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
L346334	u1788	m118	LILI	What do you want from me?
L346333	u1782	m118	BARON	Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
L346332	u1788	m118	LILI	Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
L346331	u1782	m118	BARON	I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
L346330	u1788	m118	LILI	No more... please...
L346329	u1782	m118	BARON	Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
L346328	u1788	m118	LILI	Kill me... I want... so nice...
L346327	u1782	m118	BARON	Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
L346216	u1782	m118	BARON	Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
L346215	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
L346213	u1782	m118	BARON	No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
L346212	u1788	m118	LILI	Do it now!
L346211	u1782	m118	BARON	When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
L346207	u1782	m118	BARON	We're both of us damned, my beauty.
L346206	u1788	m118	LILI	Damn you!
L346204	u1788	m118	LILI	I'd soon die.
L346203	u1782	m118	BARON	To be my bride, of course.
L346202	u1788	m118	LILI	Why have you brought me here?
L346201	u1782	m118	BARON	I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
L346200	u1788	m118	LILI	Do you feed on mice and rats?
L346199	u1782	m118	BARON	I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
L346198	u1788	m118	LILI	Like some vile toadstool.
L346197	u1782	m118	BARON	I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
L346196	u1788	m118	LILI	Protection?
L346195	u1782	m118	BARON	I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
L346194	u1788	m118	LILI	Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
L346193	u1782	m118	BARON	I am afraid of nothing.
L346192	u1788	m118	LILI	And you... are you not also afraid?
L346191	u1782	m118	BARON	We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
L346190	u1788	m118	LILI	You... you're a beast!
L346189	u1782	m118	BARON	Not from me, surely...
L346188	u1788	m118	LILI	God protect me.
L346187	u1782	m118	BARON	You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
L346186	u1788	m118	LILI	You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
L346185	u1782	m118	BARON	On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
L346184	u1788	m118	LILI	Grotesque... monstrous...
L346183	u1782	m118	BARON	You're magnificent.
L346182	u1788	m118	LILI	But I'm hideous!
L346181	u1782	m118	BARON	I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
L346180	u1788	m118	LILI	You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
L346179	u1782	m118	BARON	I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
L346178	u1788	m118	LILI	Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
L346177	u1782	m118	BARON	Your love.
L346176	u1788	m118	LILI	What do you want with me?
L346175	u1782	m118	BARON	My generosity is not so large as that.
L345926	u1783	m118	DRAGON	No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
L345925	u1785	m118	JACK	No, wait... please... listen...
L345923	u1785	m118	JACK	Oh no... Don't you understand?
L345922	u1783	m118	DRAGON	You come stealee tleasoo?
L345921	u1785	m118	JACK	I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
L345920	u1783	m118	DRAGON	An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
L345919	u1785	m118	JACK	It's terrible.
L345918	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Flozen foleva not good.
L345917	u1785	m118	JACK	Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
L345916	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
L345915	u1785	m118	JACK	You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
L345914	u1783	m118	DRAGON	You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
L345913	u1785	m118	JACK	East of Mercia?
L345912	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
L345911	u1785	m118	JACK	Cathay?
L345910	u1783	m118	DRAGON	Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
L345909	u1785	m118	JACK	Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
L345908	u1783	m118	DRAGON	No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
L345907	u1785	m118	JACK	Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
L345906	u1783	m118	DRAGON	You come stealee tleasoo?
L345905	u1785	m118	JACK	I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
L345904	u1783	m118	DRAGON	What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
L345903	u1785	m118	JACK	I didn't know... I --
L345902	u1783	m118	DRAGON	What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
L346236	u1789	m118	OGG	There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
L346235	u1784	m118	GUMP	We be honored, friend Ogg.
L346234	u1789	m118	OGG	Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
L346098	u1784	m118	GUMP	Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
L346097	u1789	m118	OGG	Who might these friends be?
L346096	u1784	m118	GUMP	Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
L346095	u1789	m118	OGG	Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
L346094	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
L346093	u1789	m118	OGG	Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
L346092	u1784	m118	GUMP	Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
L346625	u1784	m118	GUMP	You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
L346624	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll try.
L346623	u1784	m118	GUMP	You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
L346622	u1784	m118	GUMP	That's it then... the ring!
L346621	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
L346620	u1784	m118	GUMP	And did you?
L346619	u1785	m118	JACK	She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
L346618	u1784	m118	GUMP	Go on... go on...
L346617	u1785	m118	JACK	By the pond.  She was teasing me.
L346616	u1784	m118	GUMP	Where?
L346615	u1785	m118	JACK	I was with the Princess.
L346614	u1784	m118	GUMP	Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
L346613	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll do anything... face any challenge!
L346612	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
L346611	u1785	m118	JACK	The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
L346607	u1785	m118	JACK	She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
L346606	u1784	m118	GUMP	She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
L346605	u1785	m118	JACK	Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
L346604	u1784	m118	GUMP	Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
L346603	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
L346602	u1784	m118	GUMP	On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
L346601	u1784	m118	GUMP	Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
L346600	u1785	m118	JACK	Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
L346599	u1784	m118	GUMP	I've not heard a note out of you.
L346598	u1785	m118	JACK	A good day for singing...
L346583	u1784	m118	GUMP	You're on your own... like a true champion.
L346582	u1785	m118	JACK	He'll not escape me.
L346581	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ride like wild fire, Jack.
L346575	u1785	m118	JACK	Sapphire!
L346574	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
L346571	u1785	m118	JACK	I could have struck off his head just now!
L346570	u1784	m118	GUMP	Never show mercy!
L346569	u1785	m118	JACK	He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
L346562	u1785	m118	JACK	Hurry up!
L346561	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't get too far!
L346560	u1785	m118	JACK	Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
L346557	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
L346556	u1785	m118	JACK	Can't we move any faster?
L346552	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
L346551	u1785	m118	JACK	Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
L346550	u1784	m118	GUMP	Patience, lad.
L346549	u1785	m118	JACK	Will you explain what's going on?
L346545	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
L346544	u1785	m118	JACK	Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
L346543	u1784	m118	GUMP	Sunlight.
L346542	u1785	m118	JACK	What weapon?
L346541	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
L346540	u1785	m118	JACK	Did you bring me here to sup?
L346539	u1784	m118	GUMP	The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
L346537	u1784	m118	GUMP	I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
L346536	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not afraid of the dark.
L346535	u1784	m118	GUMP	Mean you to seek him out below?
L346534	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
L346533	u1784	m118	GUMP	Sunlight, you say?
L346532	u1785	m118	JACK	Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
L346531	u1784	m118	GUMP	In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
L346530	u1785	m118	JACK	The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
L346529	u1784	m118	GUMP	The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
L346528	u1785	m118	JACK	I don't... understand.
L346527	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
L346526	u1785	m118	JACK	Can you save her?
L346525	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
L346524	u1785	m118	JACK	The wound is mortal.
L346523	u1784	m118	GUMP	She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
L346522	u1785	m118	JACK	... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
L346521	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nonsense!  Course it matters.
L346520	u1785	m118	JACK	It doesn't matter.
L346519	u1784	m118	GUMP	Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
L346465	u1784	m118	GUMP	It's what we'll find there worries me.
L346464	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  We're good as inside.
L346463	u1784	m118	GUMP	Best get down close to the moat, lad.
L346462	u1785	m118	JACK	He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
L346454	u1784	m118	GUMP	Fire away!
L346453	u1785	m118	JACK	Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
L346452	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
L346451	u1785	m118	JACK	Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
L346450	u1784	m118	GUMP	That's it!
L346449	u1785	m118	JACK	One more turn...
L346435	u1785	m118	JACK	There must be some way to get it up there.
L346434	u1784	m118	GUMP	Will you chance a miss?
L346433	u1785	m118	JACK	That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
L346432	u1784	m118	GUMP	Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
L346431	u1785	m118	JACK	What magic have we on our side?
L346430	u1784	m118	GUMP	Been telling you that all along, lad.
L346429	u1785	m118	JACK	There isn't much time!
L346428	u1784	m118	GUMP	And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
L346427	u1785	m118	JACK	Water doesn't burn...
L346404	u1785	m118	JACK	Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
L346403	u1784	m118	GUMP	There aren't enough arrows.
L346402	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
L346401	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easily spoken...
L346400	u1785	m118	JACK	Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
L346399	u1784	m118	GUMP	A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
L346375	u1785	m118	JACK	We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
L346374	u1784	m118	GUMP	Why not mine the damned walls?
L346373	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
L346372	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
L346370	u1784	m118	GUMP	Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
L346369	u1785	m118	JACK	On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
L346368	u1784	m118	GUMP	That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
L346363	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
L346362	u1785	m118	JACK	There's more than one way to spring a trap.
L346361	u1784	m118	GUMP	It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
L346360	u1785	m118	JACK	Give in to despair and all is lost.
L346357	u1785	m118	JACK	It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
L346356	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
L346352	u1785	m118	JACK	The chill is worse this night.
L346351	u1784	m118	GUMP	Never felt so cold in all me born days...
L346324	u1784	m118	GUMP	No... but what choice have we?
L346323	u1785	m118	JACK	Can we trust him?
L346305	u1785	m118	JACK	But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
L346304	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
L346296	u1784	m118	GUMP	I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
L346295	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
L346294	u1784	m118	GUMP	Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
L346290	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  This time we strike first!
L346289	u1784	m118	GUMP	Wait, Jack.
L346287	u1784	m118	GUMP	Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
L346286	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll never find the Baron's castle.
L346285	u1784	m118	GUMP	Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
L346284	u1785	m118	JACK	Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
L346275	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
L346274	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll trust in faith, Gump.
L346273	u1784	m118	GUMP	Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
L346272	u1785	m118	JACK	Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
L346271	u1784	m118	GUMP	Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
L346270	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll find it.
L346269	u1784	m118	GUMP	We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
L346268	u1785	m118	JACK	No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
L346267	u1784	m118	GUMP	Is she... dead?
L346262	u1784	m118	GUMP	Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
L346261	u1785	m118	JACK	Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
L346256	u1784	m118	GUMP	Willful creature, that one...
L346255	u1785	m118	JACK	Wait!
L346249	u1785	m118	JACK	It bodes evil.
L346248	u1784	m118	GUMP	What make ye of that, Jack?
L346247	u1785	m118	JACK	There's the way, mates.
L346246	u1784	m118	GUMP	God's blessing.
L346244	u1784	m118	GUMP	Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
L346243	u1785	m118	JACK	We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
L346242	u1784	m118	GUMP	... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
L346230	u1784	m118	GUMP	Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
L346229	u1785	m118	JACK	Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
L346140	u1784	m118	GUMP	Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
L346139	u1785	m118	JACK	God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
L346138	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
L346137	u1785	m118	JACK	We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
L346136	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
L346134	u1784	m118	GUMP	Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
L346133	u1785	m118	JACK	I pray always to be worthy of it.
L346116	u1785	m118	JACK	Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
L346115	u1784	m118	GUMP	I should hope not!
L346112	u1784	m118	GUMP	Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
L346111	u1785	m118	JACK	Certainly understandable.
L346110	u1784	m118	GUMP	Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
L346109	u1784	m118	GUMP	Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
L346108	u1785	m118	JACK	Ogg's footprints!
L346107	u1784	m118	GUMP	Something the matter?
L346106	u1785	m118	JACK	My God!  Look!
L346089	u1784	m118	GUMP	Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
L346088	u1785	m118	JACK	Nice piece of work.
L346083	u1785	m118	JACK	Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
L346082	u1784	m118	GUMP	Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
L346081	u1785	m118	JACK	Better to kill than be disturbed.
L346080	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
L346079	u1785	m118	JACK	And this?  Some of their handiwork?
L346078	u1784	m118	GUMP	Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
L346077	u1785	m118	JACK	I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
L346076	u1784	m118	GUMP	Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
L346075	u1785	m118	JACK	Twould appear other travelers precede us.
L346074	u1784	m118	GUMP	Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
L346073	u1785	m118	JACK	Good.
L346070	u1784	m118	GUMP	That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
L346069	u1785	m118	JACK	Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
L346065	u1785	m118	JACK	Stealing his arms?
L346064	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
L346063	u1785	m118	JACK	There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
L346062	u1784	m118	GUMP	Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
L346061	u1785	m118	JACK	What know you of fields of war?
L346060	u1784	m118	GUMP	Worse than the battlefield.
L346056	u1784	m118	GUMP	Jack, don't!
L346055	u1785	m118	JACK	The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
L346054	u1784	m118	GUMP	Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
L346053	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
L346052	u1784	m118	GUMP	Blackheart?
L346051	u1785	m118	JACK	This is ogre's magic.
L346036	u1784	m118	GUMP	Good plan that.
L346035	u1785	m118	JACK	Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
L346034	u1784	m118	GUMP	How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
L346022	u1784	m118	GUMP	Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
L346021	u1785	m118	JACK	Beware.
L346020	u1784	m118	GUMP	Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
L346019	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
L346018	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
L346017	u1785	m118	JACK	"Jenny Greenteeth said:  ""Follow the raven in her flight..."""
L346016	u1784	m118	GUMP	Whatever for?
L346015	u1785	m118	JACK	We must follow that bird.
L346010	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
L346009	u1784	m118	GUMP	Track the demon to his lair.
L346008	u1785	m118	JACK	A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
L346007	u1784	m118	GUMP	How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
L346006	u1785	m118	JACK	We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
L346005	u1784	m118	GUMP	Fine-looking army.
L346004	u1785	m118	JACK	Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
L346003	u1784	m118	GUMP	I'll drop a cow on the knave!
L346002	u1785	m118	JACK	You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
L346001	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye!  That too.
L346000	u1785	m118	JACK	Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
L345999	u1784	m118	GUMP	Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
L345998	u1785	m118	JACK	We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
L345997	u1784	m118	GUMP	I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
L345996	u1785	m118	JACK	The colt's still too small.
L345995	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
L345975	u1784	m118	GUMP	Careful, lad.
L345974	u1785	m118	JACK	Damn them!
L345969	u1785	m118	JACK	It would appear so.
L345968	u1784	m118	GUMP	Pregnant, is she?
L345965	u1784	m118	GUMP	Something's coming.
L345964	u1785	m118	JACK	What is it?
L345955	u1784	m118	GUMP	Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
L345954	u1785	m118	JACK	Shhhh!
L345947	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
L345946	u1785	m118	JACK	I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
L345943	u1784	m118	GUMP	No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
L345942	u1785	m118	JACK	By the grace of God.
L345938	u1785	m118	JACK	Better we eat him than the other way round.
L345937	u1784	m118	GUMP	There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
L345898	u1784	m118	GUMP	You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
L345897	u1785	m118	JACK	What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
L345896	u1784	m118	GUMP	There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
L345895	u1785	m118	JACK	You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
L345894	u1784	m118	GUMP	Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
L345893	u1785	m118	JACK	Knaves and robbers...
L345892	u1784	m118	GUMP	Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
L345891	u1785	m118	JACK	So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
L345890	u1784	m118	GUMP	No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
L345889	u1785	m118	JACK	And who might that be?
L345888	u1784	m118	GUMP	A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
L345887	u1785	m118	JACK	Have we turned grave-robber, then?
L345886	u1784	m118	GUMP	There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
L345885	u1784	m118	GUMP	I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
L345884	u1785	m118	JACK	Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
L345883	u1784	m118	GUMP	Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
L345882	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
L345881	u1784	m118	GUMP	Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
L345880	u1785	m118	JACK	If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
L345879	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
L345878	u1785	m118	JACK	Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
L345877	u1784	m118	GUMP	Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
L345876	u1785	m118	JACK	The princess is dead.
L345828	u1784	m118	GUMP	Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
L345827	u1785	m118	JACK	And if she thinks me a liar?
L345826	u1784	m118	GUMP	Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
L345825	u1784	m118	GUMP	Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
L345824	u1785	m118	JACK	What do I do?
L345823	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
L345822	u1785	m118	JACK	Are we here?
L345820	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
L345819	u1785	m118	JACK	Will you lead me to her?
L345818	u1784	m118	GUMP	Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
L345817	u1785	m118	JACK	How is it this hag knows the truth?
L345816	u1784	m118	GUMP	Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
L345815	u1785	m118	JACK	Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
L345814	u1784	m118	GUMP	True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
L345813	u1785	m118	JACK	There must be an answer somewhere.
L345812	u1784	m118	GUMP	Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
L345811	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't you care about what's happened?
L345810	u1784	m118	GUMP	If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
L345809	u1785	m118	JACK	Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
L345808	u1784	m118	GUMP	That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
L345806	u1784	m118	GUMP	If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
L345805	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't you know?
L345804	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
L345803	u1785	m118	JACK	Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
L345802	u1784	m118	GUMP	Big question that, lad.  Why what?
L345801	u1785	m118	JACK	But... but, why?
L345799	u1784	m118	GUMP	He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
L345798	u1785	m118	JACK	Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
L345797	u1784	m118	GUMP	Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
L345796	u1785	m118	JACK	Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
L345795	u1784	m118	GUMP	Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
L345794	u1785	m118	JACK	It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
L345793	u1784	m118	GUMP	Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
L345791	u1785	m118	JACK	What does she want from me?
L345790	u1784	m118	GUMP	Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
L345783	u1784	m118	GUMP	Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
L345782	u1785	m118	JACK	I fear she's lost.
L345781	u1784	m118	GUMP	I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
L345780	u1785	m118	JACK	Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
L345779	u1784	m118	GUMP	You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
L345778	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
L345777	u1784	m118	GUMP	You be our guest, Jack.
L345776	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
L345775	u1785	m118	JACK	A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
L345774	u1784	m118	GUMP	Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
L345773	u1785	m118	JACK	The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
L345772	u1784	m118	GUMP	What!
L345771	u1785	m118	JACK	It's bluebells!
L345768	u1784	m118	GUMP	Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
L345767	u1785	m118	JACK	And if I cannot?
L345766	u1784	m118	GUMP	Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
L345765	u1785	m118	JACK	I meant no disrespect.
L345764	u1784	m118	GUMP	You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
L345763	u1785	m118	JACK	No... I... I need to rest.
L345762	u1784	m118	GUMP	And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
L345761	u1785	m118	JACK	Enough!
L345758	u1784	m118	GUMP	Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
L345757	u1785	m118	JACK	No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
L345754	u1784	m118	GUMP	To be sure.
L345753	u1785	m118	JACK	Faerie ring?
L345752	u1784	m118	GUMP	Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
L345751	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm in no mood for dancing.
L345750	u1784	m118	GUMP	Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
L345749	u1785	m118	JACK	Gump, is it?
L345748	u1784	m118	GUMP	So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
L346568	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Sorry.
L346567	u1784	m118	GUMP	Dolt!
L346547	u1784	m118	GUMP	They'll do nicely.
L346546	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	How're these?
L346448	u1784	m118	GUMP	Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
L346447	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
L346446	u1784	m118	GUMP	Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
L346441	u1784	m118	GUMP	Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
L346440	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Aye... my Lord...
L346439	u1784	m118	GUMP	You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
L346438	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
L346426	u1784	m118	GUMP	They've fired the moat!
L346425	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Sweet slippers of Oisin!
L346424	u1784	m118	GUMP	Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
L346423	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
L346266	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Three cheers for our champion.
L346265	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well done, lad.
L346104	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Gonna make ogre-stew!
L346103	u1784	m118	GUMP	We seek to undo the curse.
L346072	u1784	m118	GUMP	Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
L346071	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
L346048	u1784	m118	GUMP	These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
L346047	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	You see!  You see!
L346040	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	No, no, no... this is different!
L346039	u1784	m118	GUMP	Barely living, from the looks of it.
L345982	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
L345981	u1784	m118	GUMP	Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
L345941	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
L345940	u1784	m118	GUMP	Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
L345939	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
L346655	u1785	m118	JACK	Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
L346654	u1788	m118	LILI	Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
L346653	u1785	m118	JACK	Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
L346652	u1788	m118	LILI	I can't see a thing.
L346651	u1785	m118	JACK	Everywhere!  Ow!
L346650	u1788	m118	LILI	Pinching?  Where?
L346649	u1785	m118	JACK	Pinching me!
L346648	u1788	m118	LILI	Biting you?
L346647	u1785	m118	JACK	Ouch!  Something's biting me.
L346646	u1788	m118	LILI	What's the matter?
L346644	u1788	m118	LILI	And I love you, my husband.
L346643	u1785	m118	JACK	Lili... I love you!
L346642	u1788	m118	LILI	You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
L346641	u1785	m118	JACK	But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
L346640	u1788	m118	LILI	Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
L346639	u1785	m118	JACK	You're teasing still.
L346638	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
L346637	u1785	m118	JACK	Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
L346636	u1788	m118	LILI	Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
L346635	u1785	m118	JACK	I can't have been under much more than a minute.
L346634	u1788	m118	LILI	Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
L346633	u1785	m118	JACK	Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
L346632	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
L346518	u1788	m118	LILI	And I... love you...
L346517	u1785	m118	JACK	No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
L346516	u1788	m118	LILI	In the dark... where I join him...
L346515	u1785	m118	JACK	So, he's hiding in the dark...
L346514	u1788	m118	LILI	That's why he goes masked during the day...
L346513	u1785	m118	JACK	Sunlight?
L346512	u1788	m118	LILI	Sunlight... It destroys him.
L346511	u1785	m118	JACK	What?
L346510	u1788	m118	LILI	No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
L346509	u1785	m118	JACK	It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
L346508	u1788	m118	LILI	You've freed me, Jack...
L346507	u1785	m118	JACK	No!  I won't let it happen...
L346505	u1785	m118	JACK	They told me you were dead.
L346504	u1788	m118	LILI	I was bewitched... it's better this way...
L346503	u1785	m118	JACK	I thought you were dead... I --
L346502	u1788	m118	LILI	Only what's right...
L346501	u1785	m118	JACK	What have I done?
L346500	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack... Forgive me...
L346499	u1785	m118	JACK	Lili!  No!
L345741	u1785	m118	JACK	What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
L345740	u1788	m118	LILI	Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
L345739	u1785	m118	JACK	If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
L345738	u1788	m118	LILI	Then, perchance you'll me.
L345737	u1785	m118	JACK	I have no wife.
L345736	u1788	m118	LILI	Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
L345735	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis not fit for a princess.
L345734	u1788	m118	LILI	Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
L345733	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm afraid it may storm.
L345731	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, la...
L345730	u1785	m118	JACK	My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
L345729	u1788	m118	LILI	Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
L345728	u1785	m118	JACK	My lady mocks me.
L345727	u1788	m118	LILI	If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
L345726	u1785	m118	JACK	There's no happier thought under heaven.
L345725	u1788	m118	LILI	A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
L345724	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis the truth.
L345723	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
L345722	u1785	m118	JACK	Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
L345720	u1785	m118	JACK	Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
L345719	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
L345718	u1785	m118	JACK	Its powers are strong.
L345717	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't want it on me.
L345716	u1785	m118	JACK	There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
L345715	u1785	m118	JACK	Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
L345714	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
L345713	u1785	m118	JACK	He did run?
L345712	u1788	m118	LILI	It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
L345711	u1785	m118	JACK	How bad was the unicorn's wound?
L345710	u1788	m118	LILI	My own father...
L345709	u1785	m118	JACK	They tricked you.
L345708	u1788	m118	LILI	I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
L345707	u1785	m118	JACK	Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
L345706	u1788	m118	LILI	My father and the Baron.
L345705	u1785	m118	JACK	Who?
L345704	u1788	m118	LILI	I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
L345703	u1785	m118	JACK	What happened?
L345700	u1785	m118	JACK	To fetch your napkin.
L345699	u1788	m118	LILI	Where are you going?
L345698	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
L345697	u1788	m118	LILI	I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
L345696	u1785	m118	JACK	Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
L345695	u1788	m118	LILI	He'll not flee if I show myself?
L345694	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
L345693	u1788	m118	LILI	Jack!
L345692	u1785	m118	JACK	Are you honest?
L345691	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
L345690	u1785	m118	JACK	They rival the angels of paradise.
L345689	u1788	m118	LILI	Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
L345686	u1785	m118	JACK	In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
L345685	u1788	m118	LILI	I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
L345684	u1785	m118	JACK	Shhh!
L345683	u1788	m118	LILI	How much longer?
L345679	u1785	m118	JACK	Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
L345678	u1788	m118	LILI	The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
L345677	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm not its master.
L345676	u1788	m118	LILI	Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
L345675	u1785	m118	JACK	I'll go search for it.
L345674	u1788	m118	LILI	I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
L345673	u1785	m118	JACK	What's the matter?
L345672	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, dear.
L345671	u1785	m118	JACK	Be patient.
L345670	u1788	m118	LILI	What shall we do?
L345669	u1785	m118	JACK	That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
L345668	u1788	m118	LILI	I detest serpents.
L345667	u1785	m118	JACK	Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
L345666	u1788	m118	LILI	A gentleman would offer water.
L345665	u1785	m118	JACK	Stop complaining.
L345664	u1788	m118	LILI	Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
L345663	u1785	m118	JACK	All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
L345662	u1788	m118	LILI	A promise is a sacred oath.
L345661	u1785	m118	JACK	Unicorn?
L345660	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
L345659	u1785	m118	JACK	Blackheart.  Aptly named.
L345658	u1788	m118	LILI	The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
L345657	u1785	m118	JACK	Sport, indeed.
L345656	u1788	m118	LILI	It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
L345655	u1785	m118	JACK	Or perchance...
L345654	u1788	m118	LILI	Liar!
L345653	u1785	m118	JACK	I may have said perhaps...
L345652	u1788	m118	LILI	But you did... you did!
L345651	u1785	m118	JACK	Never.
L345650	u1788	m118	LILI	You promised!
L345648	u1788	m118	LILI	If you like.
L345647	u1785	m118	JACK	These for me?
L345646	u1788	m118	LILI	Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
L345645	u1785	m118	JACK	Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
L346128	u1789	m118	OGG	Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
L346127	u1785	m118	JACK	Sigurd's sword...
L346114	u1785	m118	JACK	His feet shall never cross my lips.
L346113	u1789	m118	OGG	Step lively now!
L346102	u1789	m118	OGG	Thought the weather terrible of late.
L346101	u1785	m118	JACK	We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
L346100	u1789	m118	OGG	Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
L346099	u1785	m118	JACK	Honored to make your acquaintance.
L345875	u1786	m118	JENNY	What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
L345874	u1785	m118	JACK	As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
L345873	u1786	m118	JENNY	You'll visit again?
L345872	u1785	m118	JACK	Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
L345871	u1786	m118	JENNY	Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
L345870	u1785	m118	JACK	This is sad news, be it true.
L345869	u1786	m118	JENNY	Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
L345868	u1785	m118	JACK	I don't believe you.
L345867	u1786	m118	JENNY	Dead, dead, dead.
L345866	u1785	m118	JACK	No!
L345865	u1786	m118	JENNY	She's dead!
L345864	u1785	m118	JACK	Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
L345863	u1786	m118	JENNY	As fair as me?
L345862	u1785	m118	JACK	Exceeding fair.
L345861	u1786	m118	JENNY	Is she fair, this princess?
L345860	u1785	m118	JACK	Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
L345859	u1786	m118	JENNY	Princess?  I know of no princess.
L345858	u1785	m118	JACK	What became of the princess?
L345857	u1786	m118	JENNY	Ask away, sweet man.
L345856	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
L345855	u1786	m118	JENNY	Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
L345854	u1785	m118	JACK	Not very precise directions.
L345853	u1786	m118	JENNY	Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
L345852	u1785	m118	JACK	Where do I find the Baron's castle?
L345851	u1786	m118	JENNY	You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
L345850	u1785	m118	JACK	How do I get the horn back?
L345849	u1786	m118	JENNY	That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
L345848	u1785	m118	JACK	He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
L345847	u1786	m118	JENNY	Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
L345846	u1785	m118	JACK	Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
L345845	u1786	m118	JENNY	Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
L345844	u1785	m118	JACK	A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
L345843	u1785	m118	JACK	Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
L345842	u1785	m118	JACK	Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
L345841	u1786	m118	JENNY	I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
L345840	u1785	m118	JACK	The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
L345839	u1786	m118	JENNY	The moon is too round of face, methinks.
L345838	u1785	m118	JACK	The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
L345837	u1786	m118	JENNY	Think me fair, do you, Jack?
L345836	u1785	m118	JACK	Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
L345835	u1786	m118	JENNY	Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
L345834	u1785	m118	JACK	They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
L345833	u1786	m118	JENNY	Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
L345832	u1785	m118	JACK	I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
L345831	u1786	m118	JENNY	What's this now?
L346252	u1790	m118	OONA	True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
L346251	u1785	m118	JACK	Heading north still?
L346250	u1790	m118	OONA	Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
L346226	u1790	m118	OONA	You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
L346225	u1785	m118	JACK	Be fair, Oona.
L346224	u1790	m118	OONA	I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
L346223	u1785	m118	JACK	And as barren of love as stone.
L346222	u1790	m118	OONA	What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
L346221	u1785	m118	JACK	Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
L346220	u1790	m118	OONA	Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
L346219	u1785	m118	JACK	Please...
L346218	u1790	m118	OONA	You... you... you mortal you!
L346217	u1785	m118	JACK	Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
L346167	u1790	m118	OONA	What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
L346166	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm promised to another!
L346165	u1790	m118	OONA	A faerie's love makes anything possible.
L346164	u1785	m118	JACK	Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
L346163	u1790	m118	OONA	Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
L346162	u1785	m118	JACK	Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
L346161	u1790	m118	OONA	And sweet?
L346160	u1785	m118	JACK	You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
L346159	u1790	m118	OONA	Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
L346158	u1785	m118	JACK	How so?
L346157	u1790	m118	OONA	Jest with me then.
L346156	u1785	m118	JACK	That was in jest.
L346155	u1790	m118	OONA	Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
L346154	u1785	m118	JACK	Wondrously so.
L346153	u1790	m118	OONA	And am I not fair?
L346152	u1785	m118	JACK	In every way.
L346151	u1790	m118	OONA	Do I not please you, Jack?
L346150	u1785	m118	JACK	I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
L346149	u1790	m118	OONA	Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
L346148	u1785	m118	JACK	And charmed, of course.
L346147	u1790	m118	OONA	Only that?
L346146	u1785	m118	JACK	I'd be honored.
L346145	u1790	m118	OONA	I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
L346144	u1785	m118	JACK	I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
L346143	u1790	m118	OONA	Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
L346142	u1785	m118	JACK	Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
L345992	u1785	m118	JACK	No fear of that now.
L345991	u1790	m118	OONA	Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
L345985	u1790	m118	OONA	No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
L345984	u1785	m118	JACK	Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
L345983	u1790	m118	OONA	Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
L345959	u1790	m118	OONA	Sorry.
L345958	u1785	m118	JACK	This is not the time for squabbling.
L345900	u1785	m118	JACK	I pray God grants it me.
L345899	u1790	m118	OONA	Courage, Jack.
L346627	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
L346626	u1785	m118	JACK	Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
L346573	u1785	m118	JACK	It's done... we'll never catch him.
L346572	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Sorry, Jack.
L346472	u1785	m118	JACK	Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
L346471	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Hello, Jack.
L346444	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
L346443	u1785	m118	JACK	Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
L346442	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
L346085	u1785	m118	JACK	Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
L346084	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What care the bones when the soul is free?
L346067	u1785	m118	JACK	His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
L346066	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
L346045	u1785	m118	JACK	Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
L346044	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Up ahead!
L346043	u1785	m118	JACK	Where?
L346038	u1785	m118	JACK	Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
L346037	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
L345990	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Small miracles better than no miracles...
L345989	u1785	m118	JACK	Praise be to God.
L345980	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
L345979	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm in your debt, Screwball.
L345967	u1785	m118	JACK	I think she's about to foal.
L345966	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What's she doing?
L345961	u1785	m118	JACK	We wait.
L345960	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	What do we do now?
L345949	u1785	m118	JACK	I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
L345948	u1791	m118	SCREWBALL	The fastest in the world.
L346238	u1792	m118	THURGIS	May God protect you.
L346237	u1785	m118	JACK	You're with us in battle.
L346131	u1792	m118	THURGIS	You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
L346130	u1785	m118	JACK	Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
L346129	u1792	m118	THURGIS	Uhm... fine work.
L346126	u1792	m118	THURGIS	Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
L346125	u1785	m118	JACK	The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
L346122	u1785	m118	JACK	I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
L346121	u1792	m118	THURGIS	How came you by this blade?
L346120	u1785	m118	JACK	Oh, but I have.
L346119	u1792	m118	THURGIS	Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
L346367	u1785	m118	JACK	Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
L346366	u1787	m118	JIMMY	In a dream.
L346365	u1785	m118	JACK	You've been inside?
L346364	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
L346355	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
L346354	u1785	m118	JACK	A castle's but stone and mortar --
L346353	u1787	m118	JIMMY	It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
L346322	u1787	m118	JIMMY	You follow.
L346321	u1785	m118	JACK	Let that be our problem, just get us there.
L346318	u1787	m118	JIMMY	That very nice.
L346317	u1785	m118	JACK	There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
L346316	u1787	m118	JIMMY	To Castle Couer de Noir?
L346315	u1785	m118	JACK	Can you show us the way?
L346312	u1785	m118	JACK	You do know where it is?
L346311	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
L346310	u1785	m118	JACK	Simple as that, eh?
L346308	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
L346307	u1785	m118	JACK	Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
L346306	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Lost?
L346303	u1787	m118	JIMMY	The Black Baron, you say?
L346302	u1785	m118	JACK	Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
L346300	u1787	m118	JIMMY	Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
L346299	u1785	m118	JACK	Is he a friend, then?
L346293	u1785	m118	JACK	I'm sending you back to Hell!
L346292	u1787	m118	JIMMY	No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
L350818	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Absolutely not.
L350817	u1846	m121	NICKY	Now will you get in the flask?
L350806	u1846	m121	NICKY	No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
L350805	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Is this a joke?
L350804	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
L350803	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Little Nicky.
L350740	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
L350739	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
L350657	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I hear a train coming. Drink.
L350656	u1846	m121	NICKY	Let her go.
L350655	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
L350383	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
L350382	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
L350381	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
L350380	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
L350379	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	He's sick?
L350378	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
L350375	u1846	m121	NICKY	Please, get out of my mind!
L350374	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	You shouldn't have come here.
L350373	u1846	m121	NICKY	ADRIAN!
L350864	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Don't do it!
L350863	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	No!
L350825	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
L350824	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
L350650	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You mother...
L350649	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
L350648	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	All right. Let me out.
L350647	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Hello, Cassius.
L350249	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
L350248	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
L350247	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I lowered the drinking age to ten.
L350246	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
L350245	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Let the sin begins -- that was a good one.
L350127	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	It's our time, brother.
L350126	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	...their damned souls will be ours.
L350125	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
L350124	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
L350123	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	We could create our own hell there.
L350122	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	What do you think about... Earth?
L350121	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
L350120	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Could you concentrate for five seconds?
L350119	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	That's what I thought!
L350116	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
L350115	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
L350114	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	It's just such a slap in the face.
L350113	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	And he's dead serious.
L350112	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
L350067	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
L350066	u1837	m121	CASSIUS	I knew it. He's finally retiring.
L350802	u1843	m121	JOHN	You want a queen? Got one right here.
L350801	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
L350645	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	I'm calling you out, brother...
L350644	u1843	m121	JOHN	Urr... uggg... errr...
L350643	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
L350642	u1843	m121	JOHN	Uh. No it won't?
L350641	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
L350640	u1843	m121	JOHN	And give you a good buzz.
L350637	u1843	m121	JOHN	Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
L350636	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
L350624	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Sure, why not?
L350623	u1843	m121	JOHN	But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
L350619	u1843	m121	JOHN	Noon...
L350618	u1834	m121	ADRIAN	Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
L350763	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
L350762	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	She goes to Parson's, right?
L350737	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	Show him Central Park.
L350736	u1835	m121	ANGEL	All these good people have totally been led astray.
L350731	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
L350730	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I'll call her later.
L350723	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
L350722	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
L350665	u1838	m121	CHRISTA	So excited.
L350664	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
L350785	u1835	m121	ANGEL	You're already there...
L350784	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
L350783	u1835	m121	ANGEL	It would be so okay.
L350782	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
L350776	u1835	m121	ANGEL	I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
L350775	u1846	m121	NICKY	What is it?
L350773	u1846	m121	NICKY	A speech impediment?
L350772	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
L350771	u1846	m121	NICKY	But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
L350765	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Yeah, you do...
L350764	u1846	m121	NICKY	I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
L350761	u1835	m121	ANGEL	She's so nice.
L350760	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie's crying!
L350735	u1835	m121	ANGEL	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
L350734	u1846	m121	NICKY	How did you see me?
L350729	u1846	m121	NICKY	"Well tell her I said ""hi"" back."
L350728	u1835	m121	ANGEL	"Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says ""hi."""
L350721	u1835	m121	ANGEL	It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
L350720	u1846	m121	NICKY	Where did you meet my father?
L350685	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Angels don't get any older, son.
L350684	u1846	m121	NICKY	How come you're not older?
L350680	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
L350679	u1846	m121	NICKY	Wow. What... what did she look like?
L350678	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
L350677	u1846	m121	NICKY	An angel?
L350676	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Try an angel.
L350675	u1846	m121	NICKY	My mom wasn't a goat?
L350674	u1835	m121	ANGEL	A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
L350673	u1846	m121	NICKY	My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
L350672	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
L350671	u1835	m121	ANGEL	Maybe try the opposite of that.
L350670	u1846	m121	NICKY	The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
L350800	u1836	m121	BEEFY	That turn you on there, RuPaul?
L350799	u1851	m121	TODD	Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
L350759	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I can't screw.  I can't screw.
L350758	u1851	m121	TODD	They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
L350612	u1836	m121	BEEFY	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
L350611	u1851	m121	TODD	Where is he? He's late.
L350432	u1836	m121	BEEFY	No.
L350431	u1851	m121	TODD	Did you just talk?
L350430	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
L350429	u1851	m121	TODD	What's Nicky doing down there?
L350567	u1836	m121	BEEFY	"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
L350566	u1846	m121	NICKY	This is baloney!
L350562	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I think you're looking at him.
L350561	u1846	m121	NICKY	I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
L350560	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
L350559	u1846	m121	NICKY	I didn't murder anybody
L350556	u1836	m121	BEEFY	The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
L350555	u1846	m121	NICKY	I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
L350486	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
L350485	u1846	m121	NICKY	We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
L350407	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
L350406	u1846	m121	NICKY	Release the evil?
L350405	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
L350404	u1836	m121	BEEFY	But those are my roommate's sodas... Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
L350403	u1846	m121	NICKY	But those are my roommate's sodas...
L350402	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Go get a soda out of the fridge.
L350401	u1846	m121	NICKY	Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
L350400	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
L350399	u1846	m121	NICKY	What can I do about it?
L350398	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
L350264	u1836	m121	BEEFY	I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
L350263	u1846	m121	NICKY	All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
L350254	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, let's rock and roll.
L350253	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
L350252	u1846	m121	NICKY	Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
L350251	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
L350250	u1846	m121	NICKY	This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
L350233	u1846	m121	NICKY	Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
L350232	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
L350217	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
L350216	u1846	m121	NICKY	From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
L350209	u1846	m121	NICKY	I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
L350208	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
L350207	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
L350204	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Put it in your mouth.
L350203	u1846	m121	NICKY	So far, so good. Now what?
L350202	u1836	m121	BEEFY	That pain is hunger.
L350201	u1846	m121	NICKY	I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
L350200	u1836	m121	BEEFY	You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
L350199	u1846	m121	NICKY	It's freezing up here, Beefy.
L350198	u1836	m121	BEEFY	Makin' friends already.
L350194	u1846	m121	NICKY	Oh. Sorry.
L350193	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It's not me, moron.
L350192	u1846	m121	NICKY	"Okay, ""bro,"" this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there."
L350191	u1836	m121	BEEFY	It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
L350190	u1846	m121	NICKY	I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
L350189	u1836	m121	BEEFY	My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
L350161	u1839	m121	DAD	Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
L350160	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
L350159	u1839	m121	DAD	Please, pop, just go back to your room.
L350158	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
L350157	u1839	m121	DAD	Everything's fine, pop.
L350156	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
L350144	u1839	m121	DAD	Now you're talking.
L350143	u1840	m121	DAN	This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
L350142	u1839	m121	DAD	Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
L350141	u1840	m121	DAN	You did it for Namath.
L350140	u1839	m121	DAD	In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
L350139	u1840	m121	DAN	C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
L350138	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
L350596	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
L350595	u1839	m121	DAD	Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
L350594	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Check one-two. Check one-two.
L350591	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
L350590	u1839	m121	DAD	I got no ears! I can't hear!
L350099	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
L350098	u1839	m121	DAD	No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
L350097	u1839	m121	DAD	Yes, Jimmy.
L350096	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Knock, knock.
L350859	u1846	m121	NICKY	I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
L350858	u1839	m121	DAD	Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
L350854	u1839	m121	DAD	Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
L350853	u1846	m121	NICKY	What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
L350852	u1839	m121	DAD	You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
L350851	u1846	m121	NICKY	I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
L350850	u1839	m121	DAD	You came through, Nicky.
L350593	u1839	m121	DAD	I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
L350592	u1846	m121	NICKY	Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
L350589	u1839	m121	DAD	What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
L350588	u1846	m121	NICKY	Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
L350186	u1839	m121	DAD	Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
L350185	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
L350184	u1839	m121	DAD	That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
L350180	u1839	m121	DAD	Son, just do your best.
L350179	u1846	m121	NICKY	No. This can't be happening.
L350175	u1846	m121	NICKY	Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
L350174	u1839	m121	DAD	Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
L350168	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
L350167	u1846	m121	NICKY	So go get 'em, Dad!
L350166	u1839	m121	DAD	To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
L350155	u1839	m121	DAD	I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
L350154	u1846	m121	NICKY	How bad?
L350153	u1839	m121	DAD	This is bad, Nicky.
L350146	u1839	m121	DAD	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
L350145	u1846	m121	NICKY	You're a good devil, Dad.
L350137	u1839	m121	DAD	I was just playing with you.
L350136	u1846	m121	NICKY	Metallica, Dad. Come on.
L350135	u1839	m121	DAD	Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
L350134	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
L350133	u1839	m121	DAD	I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
L350132	u1846	m121	NICKY	Definitely.
L350131	u1839	m121	DAD	"Now that was an experience. ""You are only coming through in waves."" That line blows my mind every time."
L350106	u1839	m121	DAD	The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
L350105	u1846	m121	NICKY	I mean... tough break.
L350102	u1839	m121	DAD	Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
L350101	u1846	m121	NICKY	Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
L350100	u1839	m121	DAD	This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
L350093	u1839	m121	DAD	Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
L350092	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
L350091	u1839	m121	DAD	Now everybody sit down.
L350088	u1839	m121	DAD	Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
L350087	u1846	m121	NICKY	Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
L350260	u1846	m121	NICKY	Beast.
L350259	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Bus?
L350215	u1846	m121	NICKY	You got it.
L350214	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350213	u1846	m121	NICKY	Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350212	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Thanks.
L350211	u1846	m121	NICKY	That's a pretty brassiere.
L350210	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	Hey.
L350152	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	That's what I'm thinkin'...
L350151	u1846	m121	NICKY	Coulda been much worse.
L350150	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
L350355	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
L350354	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
L350353	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Boogerland!
L350352	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	What was it called, sir.
L350351	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
L350350	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	It's Stanley, sir.
L350349	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
L350347	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
L350346	u1841	m121	GATEKEEPER	I know, your wickedness.
L350345	u1845	m121	LUCIFER	You know, I was the one who created Hell.
L350183	u1846	m121	NICKY	I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
L350182	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
L350173	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
L350172	u1846	m121	NICKY	I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
L350171	u1846	m121	NICKY	You're not saying it's up to me?
L350170	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
L350169	u1846	m121	NICKY	So go get 'em, Jimmy!
L350165	u1846	m121	NICKY	We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
L350164	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
L350065	u1846	m121	NICKY	Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
L350064	u1842	m121	JIMMY THE DEMON	Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
L350063	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey...
L350795	u1843	m121	JOHN	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
L350794	u1851	m121	TODD	His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
L350484	u1851	m121	TODD	Oh, would you grow up.
L350483	u1843	m121	JOHN	Easy, Liberace.
L350478	u1851	m121	TODD	No.
L350477	u1843	m121	JOHN	By she, do you mean he?
L350476	u1851	m121	TODD	I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
L350464	u1851	m121	TODD	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
L350463	u1843	m121	JOHN	No wonder your uncle's so weird...
L350757	u1843	m121	JOHN	Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
L350756	u1847	m121	PETER	This don't look good.
L350631	u1847	m121	PETER	Peppermint... alright.
L350630	u1843	m121	JOHN	Schnapps...
L350600	u1847	m121	PETER	We know where to find Nicky.
L350599	u1843	m121	JOHN	Looking for the chief.
L350598	u1843	m121	JOHN	Little nervous. Wanna puke.
L350597	u1847	m121	PETER	You sure you're down with this?
L350490	u1847	m121	PETER	We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
L350489	u1843	m121	JOHN	That's a big pass, Elton John.
L350428	u1843	m121	JOHN	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
L350427	u1847	m121	PETER	Look who's back from the dead.
L350281	u1843	m121	JOHN	The Dark Prince is here.
L350280	u1847	m121	PETER	Did you check out the dragon mouth?
L350274	u1843	m121	JOHN	Yeah. You do it.
L350273	u1847	m121	PETER	Should we wake him up?
L350272	u1843	m121	JOHN	Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
L350271	u1847	m121	PETER	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
L350270	u1843	m121	JOHN	What's with that guy?
L350269	u1847	m121	PETER	Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
L350268	u1843	m121	JOHN	There's our man.
L350267	u1843	m121	JOHN	'Bout time...
L350266	u1847	m121	PETER	Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
L350493	u1846	m121	NICKY	See ya, fellas.
L350492	u1843	m121	JOHN	Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
L350491	u1846	m121	NICKY	No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
L350468	u1846	m121	NICKY	Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
L350467	u1843	m121	JOHN	Come on. One more time.
L350461	u1846	m121	NICKY	Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
L350460	u1843	m121	JOHN	What's Ozzy trying to say there?
L350278	u1843	m121	JOHN	That way.
L350277	u1846	m121	NICKY	Which way did he go?
L350397	u1848	m121	REGIS	I was DeNiro!
L350396	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	Yes, great movie...
L350395	u1848	m121	REGIS	Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
L350394	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	You keep a bat under your seat?
L350393	u1848	m121	REGIS	I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
L350392	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	You followed him?
L350391	u1848	m121	REGIS	So I followed him...
L350390	u1844	m121	KATHY LEE	Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
L350389	u1848	m121	REGIS	So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
L350842	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'll just go to Heaven.
L350841	u1847	m121	PETER	You gotta kill yourself.
L350580	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
L350579	u1847	m121	PETER	Dude. Seriously?
L350578	u1846	m121	NICKY	Good idea... kill me.
L350570	u1847	m121	PETER	Dude, it's us. Let us in.
L350569	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
L350470	u1846	m121	NICKY	All right...
L350469	u1847	m121	PETER	Please. You got to.
L350524	u1846	m121	NICKY	Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
L350523	u1850	m121	STUDENT	You got the wrong window again, man.
L350506	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Andrew.
L350505	u1846	m121	NICKY	Adrian?
L350504	u1850	m121	STUDENT	I don't need luck. I'm good.
L350503	u1846	m121	NICKY	Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
L350502	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
L350501	u1846	m121	NICKY	No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
L350500	u1850	m121	STUDENT	"It's ""Comptoir Sud Pacific."" Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?"
L350499	u1846	m121	NICKY	You smell like coconuts.
L350498	u1850	m121	STUDENT	Hello.
L350848	u1846	m121	NICKY	I love you.
L350847	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I love you.
L350846	u1846	m121	NICKY	Do me.
L350831	u1846	m121	NICKY	From my dad's side of the family.
L350830	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
L350828	u1846	m121	NICKY	That was Cassius!
L350827	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Nicky!
L350659	u1846	m121	NICKY	I have to, Valerie.
L350658	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Don't do it.
L350548	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head...
L350547	u1846	m121	NICKY	I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
L350546	u1846	m121	NICKY	East Rutherford.
L350545	u1852	m121	VALERIE	We're going to Jersey?
L350544	u1846	m121	NICKY	Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
L350543	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Can we go fly over Central Park?
L350537	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Okay, I do. Get back up here.
L350536	u1846	m121	NICKY	You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
L350533	u1846	m121	NICKY	...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
L350532	u1852	m121	VALERIE	"...""The Devil?""..."
L350531	u1846	m121	NICKY	Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
L350530	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Yes...
L350529	u1846	m121	NICKY	Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
L350528	u1852	m121	VALERIE	"What do you mean, ""possessed?"""
L350527	u1846	m121	NICKY	That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
L350526	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
L350521	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
L350520	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
L350519	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Why would you be floating?
L350518	u1846	m121	NICKY	I think I'm floating.
L350517	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What are you doing?
L350516	u1846	m121	NICKY	No.
L350515	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Are you dead?
L350514	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie?
L350511	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
L350510	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What were you thinking coming here?
L350508	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
L350507	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey.
L350370	u1846	m121	NICKY	I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
L350369	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What was that?
L350368	u1846	m121	NICKY	Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
L350367	u1852	m121	VALERIE	What?
L350366	u1846	m121	NICKY	Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
L350365	u1852	m121	VALERIE	You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
L350364	u1846	m121	NICKY	Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
L350363	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Basically, yeah.
L350362	u1846	m121	NICKY	So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
L350343	u1846	m121	NICKY	Good. I was concerned.
L350342	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Sometimes, sure.
L350341	u1846	m121	NICKY	Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
L350339	u1852	m121	VALERIE	My perfume?
L350338	u1846	m121	NICKY	What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
L350337	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
L350336	u1846	m121	NICKY	School?
L350335	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
L350332	u1846	m121	NICKY	I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
L350331	u1852	m121	VALERIE	You have a dog? What kind?
L350330	u1846	m121	NICKY	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
L350329	u1852	m121	VALERIE	This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
L350327	u1852	m121	VALERIE	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
L350326	u1846	m121	NICKY	It's freezing my hands.
L350325	u1846	m121	NICKY	Uh, it's a deep south expression.
L350324	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Octopus people?
L350323	u1846	m121	NICKY	Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
L350322	u1852	m121	VALERIE	If you want to.
L350321	u1846	m121	NICKY	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
L350320	u1852	m121	VALERIE	That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
L350319	u1846	m121	NICKY	Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
L350318	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
L350317	u1846	m121	NICKY	If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
L350316	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
L350315	u1846	m121	NICKY	My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
L350314	u1852	m121	VALERIE	My dad's an optometrist.
L350313	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
L350312	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Why are you laughing?
L350311	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
L350310	u1852	m121	VALERIE	Really?
L350309	u1846	m121	NICKY	The South.
L350308	u1852	m121	VALERIE	I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
L350307	u1846	m121	NICKY	You think I'm a tourist?
L350306	u1852	m121	VALERIE	That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
L350305	u1846	m121	NICKY	That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
L350583	u1851	m121	TODD	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
L350582	u1846	m121	NICKY	That just hurt a lot.
L350482	u1851	m121	TODD	Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
L350481	u1846	m121	NICKY	A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
L350419	u1846	m121	NICKY	If it's Cassius, yes.
L350418	u1851	m121	TODD	A black guy?
L350417	u1846	m121	NICKY	It looks like the work of a brother...
L350231	u1851	m121	TODD	And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
L350230	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know.
L350229	u1851	m121	TODD	Why is that funny?
L350228	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yeah. The deep South.
L350227	u1851	m121	TODD	It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
L350226	u1846	m121	NICKY	No.
L350225	u1851	m121	TODD	Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
L350224	u1846	m121	NICKY	Off limits.
L350223	u1851	m121	TODD	Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
L350222	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. What is rent?
L350221	u1851	m121	TODD	Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
L350220	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
L350295	u1846	m121	NICKY	Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
L350294	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
L350288	u1846	m121	NICKY	I don't know?
L350287	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	"And if that is your so-called ""flask,"" how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?"
L350286	u1846	m121	NICKY	No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
L350285	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	You callin' me a thief, my man?
L350284	u1846	m121	NICKY	Yes. I would like my flask back.
L350283	u1849	m121	STREET VENDOR	See something you like, my man?
L350282	u1846	m121	NICKY	Hey...
L357776	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	"Let me have it.  ""Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."""
L357775	u1892	m124	CLERK	Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
L357774	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
L357773	u1892	m124	CLERK	Yes, sir.
L357772	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
L357771	u1892	m124	CLERK	All of it?
L357768	u1892	m124	CLERK	Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford.
L357767	u1889	m124	ASSISTANT SECRETARY	Oh, read it!
L357766	u1892	m124	CLERK	Cable from Gainsford.
L357226	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes.
L357225	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Two years!?
L357218	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
L357217	u1890	m124	BARNARD	What about those men we met this morning?
L357208	u1891	m124	CHANG	It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
L357207	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Not even a radio?
L357201	u1891	m124	CHANG	Thank you.
L357200	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
L357199	u1891	m124	CHANG	She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
L357198	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
L357661	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village?
L357660	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
L357527	u1890	m124	BARNARD	In a quandary.
L357526	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
L357525	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Come on, Lovey.
L357524	u1898	m124	LOVETT	They were in a quandary, and?
L357523	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
L357522	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"?then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, ""Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed."" And then the mama bear said, ""Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" And then the big papa bear, he roared, ""And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!"
L357520	u1898	m124	LOVETT	This doesn't obligate me in any way.
L357519	u1890	m124	BARNARD	There you are!
L357516	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Certainly not!
L357515	u1898	m124	LOVETT	And be poisoned out here in the open?
L357514	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
L357513	u1898	m124	LOVETT	So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
L357512	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
L357506	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Horns? What kind of horns?
L357505	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah. You know.
L357504	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Horns?
L357503	u1890	m124	BARNARD	They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
L357502	u1898	m124	LOVETT	And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
L357501	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, Lovey.
L357500	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
L357499	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Just call me Barney.
L357498	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
L357408	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sounds like a stall to me.
L357407	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.
L357377	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
L357376	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
L357375	u1898	m124	LOVETT	colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people?
L357374	u1890	m124	BARNARD	That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
L357368	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
L357367	u1898	m124	LOVETT	The police?
L357366	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
L357365	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Certainly not.
L357362	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
L357361	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Have I?
L357360	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
L357359	u1890	m124	BARNARD	And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
L357241	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
L357240	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.
L357239	u1890	m124	BARNARD	No kidding?
L357238	u1898	m124	LOVETT	As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
L357237	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
L357236	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm thinking.
L357235	u1890	m124	BARNARD	How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
L357179	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
L357178	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
L357177	u1898	m124	LOVETT	All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
L357176	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
L357174	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Please don't call me Lovey.
L357173	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
L357172	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
L357171	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
L357170	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
L357169	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Something tells me this means food. Come on!
L357168	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
L357167	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
L357166	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Will you stop squawking!
L357165	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
L357143	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Do you think they're cannibals?
L357142	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yes!
L357141	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Where are they? Do you see them?
L357124	u1890	m124	BARNARD	All right, all right. Keep quiet.
L357123	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
L357042	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
L357041	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
L357028	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
L357027	u1890	m124	BARNARD	He might have lost his way.
L357021	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Now you're irritating and absurd!
L357020	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
L357019	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is?  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
L357018	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yes.
L357017	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, really?
L357016	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
L357015	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south?
L357014	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Look here?
L357013	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It certainly is.
L357012	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Is it?
L357011	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's ridiculous.
L357010	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
L357009	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why, of course. Yes.
L357008	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
L357007	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm never conversational before I coffee.
L357006	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
L357005	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I see.
L357004	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I see.
L357003	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
L357000	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Good morning?
L356999	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I say, good morning, Lovey.
L356998	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I beg your pardon.
L356997	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Good morning, Lovey.
L356970	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
L356969	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Don't call me brother.
L356968	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Okay, brother.
L356967	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes, it just shows?  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
L356965	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
L356964	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
L356963	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
L356962	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
L356961	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
L356960	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.
L356959	u1898	m124	LOVETT	This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
L356958	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sorry.
L356957	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Not at all.
L356956	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
L356955	u1898	m124	LOVETT	When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
L356954	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Uh-huh.
L356953	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Found in Asia!
L356952	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, what do you know about that!
L356951	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
L356950	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, I see.
L356949	u1898	m124	LOVETT	A paleontologist.
L356948	u1890	m124	BARNARD	A what?
L356947	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm a paleontologist.
L356946	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Fossils, huh?
L356945	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Fossils.
L356944	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
L357590	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right.
L357589	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
L357588	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Gold. You were going to?
L357587	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Huh?
L357586	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Say, what about that gold deal?
L357585	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Think of it! In times like these.
L357584	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's unbelievable.
L357583	u1890	m124	BARNARD	You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
L357404	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
L357403	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
L357370	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
L357369	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Chalmers Bryant!
L357364	u1890	m124	BARNARD	All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
L357363	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
L357351	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
L357350	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
L357234	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
L357233	u1890	m124	BARNARD	That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
L357181	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I'll say.
L357180	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
L357115	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
L357114	u1890	m124	BARNARD	What are we going to do?
L357040	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
L357039	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, that's that, I guess.
L357038	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
L357037	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Charming chap.
L357645	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
L357644	u1895	m124	GLORIA	If you want me to!
L357631	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
L357630	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
L357629	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
L357356	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Why, you look beautiful.
L357355	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Nothing. Why?
L357354	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey, what's happened to you?
L356975	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
L356974	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Say, you're an American, aren't you?
L356973	u1895	m124	GLORIA	No.
L356972	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I say, will you have a cigarette?
L357643	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
L357642	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
L357641	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business?
L357640	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
L357639	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Well - I'm?
L357638	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You mean you don't want to go?
L357637	u1890	m124	BARNARD	I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
L357636	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
L357635	u1890	m124	BARNARD	When are you going to start?
L357634	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
L357633	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Leaving?
L357632	u1894	m124	GEORGE	There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
L357140	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Look, Bob!
L357139	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Hey - look!
L357138	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Over by that hill.
L357137	u1890	m124	BARNARD	Cave, eh? Where?
L357619	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
L357618	u1891	m124	CHANG	You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
L357613	u1891	m124	CHANG	Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
L357612	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
L357611	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
L357610	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
L357609	u1891	m124	CHANG	Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
L357608	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Suppose she should leave it?
L357607	u1891	m124	CHANG	Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
L357606	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
L357605	u1891	m124	CHANG	Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
L357604	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
L357603	u1891	m124	CHANG	Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
L357602	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes, charming.
L357601	u1891	m124	CHANG	Charming, isn't she?
L357598	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
L357597	u1891	m124	CHANG	Shall we have another?
L357596	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes. I'm afraid it does.
L357413	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
L357412	u1891	m124	CHANG	The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
L357411	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
L357410	u1891	m124	CHANG	The only one.
L357409	u1893	m124	CONWAY	One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
L357332	u1891	m124	CHANG	Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
L357331	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
L357330	u1891	m124	CHANG	I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
L357329	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I surprise you? Now that's news.
L357328	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
L357327	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
L357326	u1891	m124	CHANG	And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
L357325	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Very often.
L357324	u1891	m124	CHANG	"Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, ""He worried himself to death?"" or, ""This thing or that killed him?"""
L357323	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
L357322	u1891	m124	CHANG	You're startled?
L357321	u1893	m124	CONWAY	108 and still active?
L357320	u1891	m124	CHANG	Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
L357319	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, is it?
L357318	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
L357317	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, they didn't actually mean that.
L357316	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
L357315	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He amputated his own leg?
L357314	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
L357313	u1893	m124	CONWAY	When was all this?
L357312	u1891	m124	CHANG	A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
L357311	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who?
L357310	u1891	m124	CHANG	That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
L357309	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
L357308	u1891	m124	CHANG	Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
L357307	u1893	m124	CONWAY	?buy and sell?
L357306	u1891	m124	CHANG	Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
L357305	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
L357304	u1891	m124	CHANG	Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
L357303	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
L357302	u1891	m124	CHANG	Centuries.
L357301	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, it must have taken?
L357300	u1891	m124	CHANG	They were.
L357299	u1893	m124	CONWAY	But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
L357296	u1891	m124	CHANG	You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
L357295	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
L357294	u1891	m124	CHANG	Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
L357293	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
L357292	u1891	m124	CHANG	Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
L357291	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You have no disputes over women?
L357290	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
L357289	u1893	m124	CONWAY	How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
L357288	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, good heavens, no!
L357287	u1893	m124	CONWAY	How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
L357286	u1891	m124	CHANG	We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
L357285	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's intelligent.
L357284	u1891	m124	CHANG	To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including?  ?the excess of virtue itself.
L357283	u1891	m124	CHANG	We follow many.
L357282	u1893	m124	CONWAY	By the way, what religion do you follow here?
L357275	u1891	m124	CHANG	Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
L357274	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
L357273	u1891	m124	CHANG	There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
L357272	u1893	m124	CONWAY	For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
L357271	u1891	m124	CHANG	In time you will meet them all.
L357270	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who, for instance?
L357269	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, yes.
L357268	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So there are others?
L357267	u1891	m124	CHANG	Goodness, no!
L357266	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
L357265	u1891	m124	CHANG	It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
L357203	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
L357202	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And the wine - excellent.
L357160	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Thank you.
L357159	u1891	m124	CHANG	You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
L357154	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
L357153	u1891	m124	CHANG	Where is your mad pilot?
L357150	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction?
L357149	u1891	m124	CHANG	How do you do?
L357148	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And mine's Conway.
L357193	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
L357192	u1891	m124	CHANG	You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
L357191	u1895	m124	GLORIA	Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
L357190	u1891	m124	CHANG	Please let me help you.
L357189	u1895	m124	GLORIA	No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
L357188	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
L357187	u1895	m124	GLORIA	I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
L357186	u1891	m124	CHANG	Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
L357185	u1895	m124	GLORIA	You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
L357184	u1891	m124	CHANG	I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
L357183	u1895	m124	GLORIA	What do you want?
L357582	u1891	m124	CHANG	Thank you.
L357581	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, thank you. Thank you!
L357580	u1891	m124	CHANG	Then it's done.
L357579	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, immediately.
L357578	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
L357577	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
L357576	u1891	m124	CHANG	Splendid!
L357575	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
L357574	u1891	m124	CHANG	Now, what would you like to do?
L357573	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"Ungrateful fool . . . !  Those were my very words to myself last night. ""Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."""
L357572	u1891	m124	CHANG	Why, no.
L357571	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, ""Lovey""?  Mr. Lovett! ""Mr. Lovett,"" I said, ""you are an ungrateful fool . . . """
L357570	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, I'm so glad.
L357569	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
L357568	u1891	m124	CHANG	You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
L357567	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
L357566	u1891	m124	CHANG	Yes.
L357565	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
L357402	u1898	m124	LOVETT	The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
L357401	u1891	m124	CHANG	You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
L357224	u1891	m124	CHANG	Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
L357223	u1898	m124	LOVETT	"What exactly do you mean by ""almost any time now""?"
L357216	u1891	m124	CHANG	No.
L357215	u1898	m124	LOVETT	No porters here!!
L357214	u1891	m124	CHANG	I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
L357213	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
L357617	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out?porters or no porters!
L357616	u1891	m124	CHANG	Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't?
L357615	u1894	m124	GEORGE	A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
L357406	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
L357405	u1891	m124	CHANG	The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
L357222	u1891	m124	CHANG	In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now?
L357221	u1894	m124	GEORGE	How can we get in touch with them?
L357220	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
L357212	u1891	m124	CHANG	Oh, dear.
L357211	u1894	m124	GEORGE	As far away as I ever want to be.
L357210	u1891	m124	CHANG	Are you so certain you are away from it?
L357209	u1894	m124	GEORGE	In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
L357156	u1891	m124	CHANG	Pardon me?
L357155	u1894	m124	GEORGE	We were just going to bury him when you came along.
L357761	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hey!
L357760	u1899	m124	MARIA	No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
L357743	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
L357742	u1899	m124	MARIA	Are you taking me?
L357734	u1899	m124	MARIA	No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
L357733	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're lying, aren't you?
L357730	u1899	m124	MARIA	I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
L357729	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Yes.
L357728	u1899	m124	MARIA	Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
L357727	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
L357726	u1899	m124	MARIA	He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
L357725	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault is dead.
L357724	u1899	m124	MARIA	The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
L357723	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
L357722	u1899	m124	MARIA	I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
L357721	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
L357720	u1899	m124	MARIA	It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
L357435	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
L357434	u1893	m124	CONWAY	But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
L357433	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
L357432	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
L357431	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
L357430	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, the girl at the piano?
L357429	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sondra Bizet.
L357428	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
L357427	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
L357425	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
L357424	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago?  ?you're still alive, Father Perrault!
L357423	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	What is it, my son?
L357422	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's astonishing - and incredible, but?
L357421	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as?
L357420	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
L357419	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Yes.
L357418	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Are you the High Lama?
L357417	u1896	m124	HIGH LAMA	Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
L357627	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Do you think this will come in my time?
L357626	u1897	m124	LAMA	I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
L357624	u1897	m124	LAMA	Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
L357623	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Mine?
L357622	u1897	m124	LAMA	You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
L357621	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
L357620	u1897	m124	LAMA	Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
L357763	u1893	m124	CONWAY	As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
L357762	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
L357759	u1893	m124	CONWAY	There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
L357758	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
L357750	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
L357749	u1894	m124	GEORGE	was saying?
L357748	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What was that?
L357747	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
L357741	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! We're wasting time!
L357740	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
L357739	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What about the others?
L357738	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, everything!
L357737	u1893	m124	CONWAY	The clothes?
L357736	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L357735	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You say the porters are waiting for us?
L357732	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
L357731	u1894	m124	GEORGE	She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
L357714	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
L357713	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
L357712	u1894	m124	GEORGE	So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
L357711	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
L357710	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're wrong, George.
L357709	u1894	m124	GEORGE	This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
L357708	u1893	m124	CONWAY	She came here in 1888!
L357707	u1894	m124	GEORGE	"What do you mean - ""fade away like an echo""?"
L357706	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
L357705	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why not?
L357704	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You can't take her away from here!
L357702	u1894	m124	GEORGE	She's going with me.
L357701	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What's she got to do with it?
L357700	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, the little Russian girl.
L357699	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Maria?
L357698	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
L357697	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
L357696	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
L357695	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
L357694	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'd go mad!
L357693	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
L357692	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
L357691	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, George . . .
L357690	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
L357689	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
L357688	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned?
L357687	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
L357686	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
L357685	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
L357684	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
L357683	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
L357682	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
L357681	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Is that all my story meant to you?
L357680	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
L357679	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't need any proof.
L357678	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
L357677	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
L357676	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
L357675	u1893	m124	CONWAY	So you think I'm mad?
L357674	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
L357672	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
L357671	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
L357670	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
L357669	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
L357668	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
L357667	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why not? What's going to stop me?
L357666	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You can't leave, George.
L357665	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
L357594	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't see that there's anything to say.
L357593	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
L357445	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
L357444	u1894	m124	GEORGE	For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of?
L357442	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why - I'm sorry - but I?
L357441	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
L357440	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Porters?
L357439	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What about the porters?
L357392	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right. Sorry, George.
L357391	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Let me up! Let me up!
L357387	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Chang! Chang! Chang!
L357386	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, come back!
L357385	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Let me go, Bob!
L357384	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, what do you think you're doing?
L357349	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Shhh!
L357348	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
L357347	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
L357346	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
L357345	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Porters?
L357344	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Nothing about the porters yet?
L357343	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
L357264	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's what's on the other side of the hill.
L357263	u1894	m124	GEORGE	There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
L357262	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Uh-huh.
L357261	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Chang's first question was about the pilot.
L357260	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
L357259	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
L357258	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well - I mean?
L357257	u1894	m124	GEORGE	That's what you said.
L357256	u1893	m124	CONWAY	"Did I say ""if""?"
L357255	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What do you mean if we should get out?
L357254	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
L357253	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
L357252	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
L357251	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
L357250	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know.
L357249	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What are you talking about?
L357248	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
L357247	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You talk as though you intend on staying.
L357246	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
L357245	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
L357244	u1893	m124	CONWAY	We've had plenty of it the last few days.
L357243	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
L357242	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello, George.  Cigarette?
L357108	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
L357107	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What's it mean?
L357106	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
L357105	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L357104	u1893	m124	CONWAY	See that spot?
L357103	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What is it?
L357101	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Dead?
L357100	u1893	m124	CONWAY	He's dead.
L357098	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
L357097	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What is it? Has he fainted?
L357084	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
L357083	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh George, come on.
L357064	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
L357063	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What are these people?
L357048	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
L357047	u1893	m124	CONWAY	George, what are you going to do?
L357034	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
L357033	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, stop it!
L356995	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
L356994	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Do try to sleep, Bob.
L356993	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
L356991	u1893	m124	CONWAY	"Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, ""Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?""  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - ""Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?"" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants?  ?and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum."
L356990	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
L356989	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
L356988	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356987	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Did you say we saved ninety white people?
L356986	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes, Bob.
L356985	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
L356982	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
L356981	u1894	m124	GEORGE	"How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, ""There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."""
L356980	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hurray!
L356979	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
L356978	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You?
L356977	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Just what I needed too.
L356943	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
L356942	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
L356926	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! Quick! This way.
L356925	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob, these are all that are left.
L356921	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Right, Bob.
L356920	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
L356919	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
L356918	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
L356904	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Hello? Colonel?
L356903	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356902	u1893	m124	CONWAY	And be sure that none of the natives get in.
L356901	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Yes.
L356900	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
L356899	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Bob! I think I hear motors!
L357152	u1893	m124	CONWAY	We'd be eternally grateful if you?
L357151	u1898	m124	LOVETT	At the mercy of a mad pilot.
L357080	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
L357079	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
L357067	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Where are we going? Huh?
L357066	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
L357060	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
L357059	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Why, you - you? Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
L357058	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What do you suggest?
L357057	u1898	m124	LOVETT	You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
L357056	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
L357055	u1898	m124	LOVETT	In for what?
L357054	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I guess we're in for it.
L357052	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
L357051	u1898	m124	LOVETT	We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
L357050	u1893	m124	CONWAY	What if he refuses?
L357049	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Good.
L357046	u1898	m124	LOVETT	What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
L357045	u1893	m124	CONWAY	That fellow got on at Baskul.
L357044	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
L357043	u1893	m124	CONWAY	No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
L356941	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
L356940	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly?
L356939	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Where were you hiding?
L356936	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Why aren't you registered through our office?
L356935	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
L356934	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Where did you come from?
L357564	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
L357563	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
L357561	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357560	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I'd love it!
L357559	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Would you like to wring my little neck?
L357558	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
L357557	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why, mother?
L357556	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
L357555	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I was just going to.
L357554	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
L357553	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357552	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
L357551	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Struggling, why?
L357550	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
L357549	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Why?
L357548	u1893	m124	CONWAY	It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
L357547	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
L357546	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
L357545	u1900	m124	SONDRA	You see, it's not a dream.
L357544	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Ouch!
L357543	u1893	m124	CONWAY	When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
L357542	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Bump?
L357541	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
L357497	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
L357496	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
L357495	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I wonder.
L357494	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
L357493	u1893	m124	CONWAY	I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
L357492	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm so glad.
L357491	u1893	m124	CONWAY	On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
L357490	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
L357489	u1893	m124	CONWAY	All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
L357488	u1900	m124	SONDRA	What is?
L357485	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
L357484	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'm thirty.
L357483	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
L357482	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes, I know.
L357481	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
L357480	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
L357479	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Thank you.
L357478	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
L357477	u1893	m124	CONWAY	There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
L357476	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
L357475	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
L357474	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
L357473	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes.
L357472	u1893	m124	CONWAY	A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
L357471	u1900	m124	SONDRA	As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
L357470	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
L357469	u1893	m124	CONWAY	A man whose life was empty!
L357468	u1900	m124	SONDRA	I saw a man whose life was empty.
L357467	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
L357466	u1900	m124	SONDRA	That was easy. I read your books.
L357465	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
L357464	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Yes. Hold this pigeon.
L357463	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Was this your idea?
L357460	u1900	m124	SONDRA	Oh, you mean my pigeons.
L357459	u1893	m124	CONWAY	You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
L357458	u1893	m124	CONWAY	hope you'll forgive me for?
L357457	u1900	m124	SONDRA	My name's Sondra.
L357456	u1893	m124	CONWAY	Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
L357654	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Yes.  Barney!
L357653	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'll wait till you rot!
L357652	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
L357651	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
L357650	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
L357649	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
L357648	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Go? Where?
L357647	u1894	m124	GEORGE	How about you? Do you want to go?
L357231	u1894	m124	GEORGE	We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
L357230	u1898	m124	LOVETT	That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
L357205	u1894	m124	GEORGE	The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
L357204	u1898	m124	LOVETT	Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
L357147	u1898	m124	LOVETT	English!
L357146	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Why, he's speaking English.
L357130	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
L357129	u1898	m124	LOVETT	What is it?
L357082	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
L357081	u1894	m124	GEORGE	What do you want him to do?
L357026	u1898	m124	LOVETT	It's Fenner.
L357025	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
L357024	u1898	m124	LOVETT	I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
L357023	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
L356938	u1898	m124	LOVETT	How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
L356937	u1894	m124	GEORGE	It would serve you right if you were left behind.
L357539	u1894	m124	GEORGE	You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
L357538	u1899	m124	MARIA	Thank you.
L357537	u1894	m124	GEORGE	All right, I'll be there.
L357536	u1899	m124	MARIA	Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
L357535	u1894	m124	GEORGE	Perhaps.
L357534	u1899	m124	MARIA	I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
L357533	u1894	m124	GEORGE	I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
L357532	u1899	m124	MARIA	You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
L357278	u1899	m124	MARIA	Please don't go.
L357277	u1894	m124	GEORGE	EXCUSE ME?
L390641	u2113	m137	ALICE	They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
L390640	u2120	m137	JULIE	4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet.
L390622	u2120	m137	JULIE	I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
L390621	u2113	m137	ALICE	Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
L390620	u2120	m137	JULIE	The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
L390473	u2120	m137	JULIE	Five CC's.
L390472	u2113	m137	ALICE	Most we've ever used is half a CC.
L390471	u2120	m137	JULIE	What's the maximum safe dose?
L390226	u2113	m137	ALICE	Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
L390225	u2120	m137	JULIE	Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
L390224	u2113	m137	ALICE	Monkeybone?
L390223	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
L390222	u2113	m137	ALICE	What?
L390221	u2120	m137	JULIE	Switch hands.
L390220	u2113	m137	ALICE	How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
L390219	u2120	m137	JULIE	He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
L390218	u2113	m137	ALICE	Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
L390217	u2120	m137	JULIE	Yeah...before your time.
L390216	u2113	m137	ALICE	When he first came in to the sleep lab?
L390215	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu. That was right about the time we met.
L390214	u2113	m137	ALICE	Who did this?
L390212	u2120	m137	JULIE	I don't know. I guess it was...
L390211	u2113	m137	ALICE	Special occasion?
L390210	u2120	m137	JULIE	Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
L390209	u2113	m137	ALICE	Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
L390257	u2124	m137	STU	I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
L390256	u2114	m137	BULL	Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
L390255	u2124	m137	STU	Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
L390254	u2114	m137	BULL	Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
L390203	u2114	m137	BULL	Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
L390202	u2124	m137	STU	I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
L390201	u2124	m137	STU	I didn't say anything.
L390200	u2114	m137	BULL	<i></i> I beg your pardon?
L390199	u2114	m137	BULL	Sad commentary, huh?
L390198	u2124	m137	STU	Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
L390196	u2114	m137	BULL	Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
L390195	u2124	m137	STU	Stu Miley.
L390194	u2114	m137	BULL	Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
L390193	u2124	m137	STU	Olive. - Where exactly am I?
L390192	u2114	m137	BULL	Olive or eyeball?
L390191	u2124	m137	STU	Uhh - martini?
L390190	u2114	m137	BULL	Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
L390189	u2114	m137	BULL	Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
L390188	u2124	m137	STU	Chasing me - animals - horrible -
L390747	u2115	m137	DEATH	Thank me next time you see me.
L390746	u2124	m137	STU	Death! Thank you!
L390745	u2115	m137	DEATH	"It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the ""Family Circus"" guy instead."
L390744	u2124	m137	STU	Back? You're sending me back?
L390743	u2115	m137	DEATH	Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
L390742	u2124	m137	STU	Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
L390740	u2124	m137	STU	Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
L390739	u2115	m137	DEATH	I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
L390738	u2124	m137	STU	DEATH!!
L390670	u2124	m137	STU	Bend over?
L390669	u2115	m137	DEATH	<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
L390668	u2124	m137	STU	Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
L390667	u2115	m137	DEATH	If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
L390666	u2115	m137	DEATH	Well - you'd need a body.
L390665	u2124	m137	STU	Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
L390664	u2115	m137	DEATH	I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
L390663	u2124	m137	STU	I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
L390662	u2115	m137	DEATH	<u>Why</u>??
L390661	u2124	m137	STU	I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
L390660	u2115	m137	DEATH	Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
L390659	u2124	m137	STU	You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
L390250	u2121	m137	KIMMY	I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
L390249	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
L390244	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
L390243	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
L390242	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
L390241	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	At the moment, yes.
L390240	u2121	m137	KIMMY	But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
L390239	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
L390238	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
L390237	u2116	m137	DR. EDELSTEIN	Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
L390648	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
L390647	u2117	m137	HERB	I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
L390646	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pi?ata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
L390645	u2117	m137	HERB	You're really gonna pop the question?
L390607	u2117	m137	HERB	And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
L390606	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
L390605	u2117	m137	HERB	Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
L390604	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	How much?
L390603	u2117	m137	HERB	Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
L390602	u2117	m137	HERB	Less.
L390601	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
L390600	u2117	m137	HERB	What's the matter?
L390614	u2117	m137	HERB	A pi?ata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
L390613	u2124	m137	STU	So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pi?ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
L390150	u2117	m137	HERB	...In some weird way I respect that.
L390149	u2124	m137	STU	My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
L390148	u2117	m137	HERB	Oh my God...you're proposing?
L390147	u2124	m137	STU	I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
L390146	u2117	m137	HERB	Why?
L390145	u2124	m137	STU	Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
L390144	u2117	m137	HERB	Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
L390143	u2124	m137	STU	I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
L390142	u2117	m137	HERB	Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
L390141	u2124	m137	STU	Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
L390140	u2117	m137	HERB	Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
L390139	u2124	m137	STU	Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
L390138	u2117	m137	HERB	Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
L390137	u2124	m137	STU	Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
L390136	u2117	m137	HERB	Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
L390651	u2120	m137	JULIE	Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
L390650	u2118	m137	HUTCH	The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
L390432	u2120	m137	JULIE	What'll it do if they pull the plug?
L390431	u2118	m137	HUTCH	You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
L390429	u2120	m137	JULIE	I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
L390428	u2118	m137	HUTCH	That's not going to stop his nightmare -
L390427	u2120	m137	JULIE	No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
L390424	u2120	m137	JULIE	He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
L390423	u2118	m137	HUTCH	Holy shit.
L390524	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
L390523	u2124	m137	STU	You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
L390522	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
L390521	u2124	m137	STU	Monkeybone...!?
L390520	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
L390519	u2124	m137	STU	But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
L390518	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
L390517	u2124	m137	STU	Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
L390516	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
L390515	u2124	m137	STU	YOU SET ME UP!!
L390514	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
L390485	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
L390484	u2124	m137	STU	NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
L390397	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
L390396	u2124	m137	STU	Land of Death. How do I get there?
L390393	u2124	m137	STU	Hyp, I'll do anything.
L390392	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
L390391	u2124	m137	STU	Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
L390388	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
L390387	u2124	m137	STU	You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
L390386	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
L390385	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
L390384	u2124	m137	STU	Maybe you could talk to Death!
L390383	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
L390380	u2124	m137	STU	Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
L390379	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
L390378	u2124	m137	STU	Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
L390374	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
L390373	u2124	m137	STU	I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
L390371	u2124	m137	STU	Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
L390370	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
L390369	u2124	m137	STU	Tell me what?
L390368	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
L390366	u2124	m137	STU	Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
L390365	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Uh huh. And?
L390364	u2124	m137	STU	Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
L390363	u2119	m137	HYPNOS	Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
L390702	u2120	m137	JULIE	"He called me ""Doc."""
L390701	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
L390698	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
L390697	u2120	m137	JULIE	But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
L390696	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
L390695	u2120	m137	JULIE	It looks so...<u>new</u>.
L390694	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
L390598	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
L390597	u2120	m137	JULIE	You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
L390596	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
L390595	u2120	m137	JULIE	Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
L390594	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
L390593	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
L390582	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
L390581	u2120	m137	JULIE	What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
L390574	u2120	m137	JULIE	I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
L390573	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
L390571	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	I need a new PR guy.
L390570	u2120	m137	JULIE	They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
L390569	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	"Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. ""Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma"" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?"
L390568	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
L390567	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
L390546	u2120	m137	JULIE	Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
L390545	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Got a doctor on duty.
L390544	u2120	m137	JULIE	You sure this is...medically advisable?
L390543	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Ohhh, nothing.
L390542	u2120	m137	JULIE	What are you watching?
L390538	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	<i></i> In what way?
L390537	u2120	m137	JULIE	You're acting kind of...odd.
L390536	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Sure. Why?
L390535	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu, are you...feeling okay?
L390534	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Bitchin' good cake.
L390532	u2120	m137	JULIE	Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
L390531	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
L390530	u2125	m137	STU-BONE	Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
L390529	u2120	m137	JULIE	Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
L390758	u2124	m137	STU	My <u>tail</u> itches.
L390757	u2120	m137	JULIE	What's the matter?
L390756	u2124	m137	STU	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
L390755	u2120	m137	JULIE	Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
L390550	u2120	m137	JULIE	It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
L390549	u2124	m137	STU	How was it? I don't recall.
L390490	u2124	m137	STU	Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
L390489	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu?
L390171	u2124	m137	STU	I'd better go report this...
L390170	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
L390166	u2124	m137	STU	Are you okay??
L390165	u2120	m137	JULIE	I don't think so.
L390164	u2124	m137	STU	Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
L390162	u2124	m137	STU	I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
L390161	u2120	m137	JULIE	<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
L390160	u2124	m137	STU	I might wake up.
L390159	u2120	m137	JULIE	"What's the ""bad"" part?"
L390158	u2124	m137	STU	I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
L390157	u2120	m137	JULIE	Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
L390156	u2124	m137	STU	The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
L390155	u2120	m137	JULIE	Who?
L390154	u2124	m137	STU	Look at this! He won't let us leave!
L390135	u2124	m137	STU	Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
L390134	u2120	m137	JULIE	Can't you give it to me later?
L390133	u2124	m137	STU	That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
L390132	u2120	m137	JULIE	It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
L390131	u2124	m137	STU	They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
L390130	u2120	m137	JULIE	You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
L390322	u2121	m137	KIMMY	This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
L390321	u2120	m137	JULIE	Kimmy! What's the matter?
L390248	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Give me a date, Doctor.
L390247	u2120	m137	JULIE	It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
L390246	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
L390245	u2120	m137	JULIE	Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
L390235	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
L390234	u2120	m137	JULIE	The ring...
L390233	u2121	m137	KIMMY	I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
L390232	u2120	m137	JULIE	I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
L390231	u2121	m137	KIMMY	An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
L390230	u2120	m137	JULIE	When'd you get in?
L390229	u2121	m137	KIMMY	Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
L390638	u2124	m137	STU	Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
L390637	u2122	m137	KITTY	Go. Just <u>go</u>.
L390636	u2122	m137	KITTY	<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
L390635	u2124	m137	STU	How am I gonna get past the guards?
L390634	u2122	m137	KITTY	You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
L390633	u2124	m137	STU	You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
L390632	u2122	m137	KITTY	Don't ask where I got it.
L390563	u2124	m137	STU	Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
L390562	u2122	m137	KITTY	You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
L390561	u2124	m137	STU	Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
L390560	u2122	m137	KITTY	I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
L390276	u2124	m137	STU	Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
L390275	u2122	m137	KITTY	Hypnos?
L390272	u2122	m137	KITTY	Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
L390271	u2124	m137	STU	Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
L390481	u2124	m137	STU	Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
L390480	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
L390479	u2124	m137	STU	You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
L390478	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
L390477	u2124	m137	STU	It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
L390476	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
L390475	u2124	m137	STU	You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
L390467	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Isn't that Lulu?
L390466	u2124	m137	STU	What?
L390465	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu...LOOK!
L390464	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	There's a thing here! There's a switch!
L390463	u2124	m137	STU	IT'S NOT WORKING.
L390462	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu...Stu...
L390420	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I don't <u>know</u>.
L390419	u2124	m137	STU	Where'd he go??
L390418	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
L390417	u2124	m137	STU	He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
L390408	u2124	m137	STU	Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
L390407	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
L390406	u2124	m137	STU	All right. You can come.
L390405	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
L390404	u2124	m137	STU	No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
L390403	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
L390402	u2124	m137	STU	<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
L390401	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
L390400	u2124	m137	STU	Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
L390399	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
L390382	u2124	m137	STU	Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
L390381	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
L390376	u2124	m137	STU	Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
L390375	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
L390362	u2124	m137	STU	Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
L390361	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
L390360	u2124	m137	STU	How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
L390325	u2124	m137	STU	Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
L390324	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
L390307	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
L390306	u2124	m137	STU	I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
L390305	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
L390304	u2124	m137	STU	<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
L390303	u2124	m137	STU	<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
L390302	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
L390301	u2124	m137	STU	He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
L390291	u2124	m137	STU	Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
L390290	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
L390288	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
L390287	u2124	m137	STU	<u>What</u> union?
L390286	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I'm reportin' this to my union!!
L390285	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
L390284	u2124	m137	STU	THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
L390283	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
L390280	u2124	m137	STU	<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
L390279	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
L390274	u2124	m137	STU	I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
L390273	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
L390267	u2124	m137	STU	Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
L390266	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
L390265	u2124	m137	STU	I am not. And I don't gotta.
L390264	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
L390263	u2124	m137	STU	Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
L390262	u2123	m137	MONKEYBONE	I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
L390261	u2124	m137	STU	<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
L401318	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Well, okay then.
L401317	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
L401316	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I never killed a priest before.
L401315	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	Priests. Imhotep's priests.
L401314	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Who the hell are these guys?
L401267	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
L401266	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You know where he's taking her?
L401083	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
L401082	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
L401081	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Relax, I got him.
L401080	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
L401278	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Did you say 'kill' my sister?
L401277	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
L401274	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Excuse me?
L401273	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	And then killing your sister.
L401272	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Oh yes, of course.
L401271	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	By reading the Book Of The Dead.
L401270	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And how does one do that?
L401269	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
L401268	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And what ritual would that be?
L401091	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	You're not going to kill us?
L401090	u2201	m142	ARDETH RAY	We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
L401195	u2202	m142	BENI	Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
L401194	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What does he want the book for?
L401193	u2202	m142	BENI	The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
L401192	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
L401191	u2202	m142	BENI	You shall see.
L401190	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Immune from what?
L401189	u2202	m142	BENI	It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
L401188	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
L401187	u2202	m142	BENI	What friend? You're my only friend.
L401186	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Where's your new friend?
L401125	u2202	m142	BENI	Do you know where I can steal some?
L401124	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
L401123	u2202	m142	BENI	He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
L401122	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
L401121	u2202	m142	BENI	The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
L401120	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
L401119	u2202	m142	BENI	This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
L401118	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
L401117	u2202	m142	BENI	You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
L401116	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
L400968	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	'Cause I look good doin, it.
L400967	u2202	m142	BENI	Why do you like to fight so much?
L400966	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	C'mon, friend.
L400965	u2202	m142	BENI	Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
L400964	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Goin' somewhere?
L400915	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I've had worse.
L400914	u2202	m142	BENI	Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
L400856	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
L400855	u2202	m142	BENI	Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
L400836	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Sounds familiar.
L400835	u2202	m142	BENI	O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
L400834	u2202	m142	BENI	Even?
L400833	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Let's make us even, shall we?
L400832	u2202	m142	BENI	You always did have more balls than brains.
L400831	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
L400829	u2202	m142	BENI	Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
L400828	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
L400827	u2202	m142	BENI	You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
L400826	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
L400825	u2202	m142	BENI	My very good friend! What a surprise.
L400645	u2202	m142	BENI	Then what the hell are you doing here!?
L400644	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	None of the above, thank you.
L400643	u2202	m142	BENI	What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
L400641	u2202	m142	BENI	Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
L400640	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Altar boys?
L400639	u2202	m142	BENI	I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
L400638	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
L400636	u2202	m142	BENI	In the desert? What for?
L400635	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Now go find me a big stick.
L400631	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
L400630	u2202	m142	BENI	Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
L401311	u2202	m142	BENI	Yeah! Them.
L401310	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Intestines.
L401309	u2202	m142	BENI	...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
L401302	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh yes, always.
L401301	u2202	m142	BENI	Yeah?
L401290	u2202	m142	BENI	All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
L401289	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What just happened?
L401050	u2205	m142	EVELYN	That's one way of putting it.
L401049	u2202	m142	BENI	Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
L401221	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Exactly --
L401220	u2203	m142	CURATOR	-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
L401219	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
L401168	u2203	m142	CURATOR	It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
L401167	u2205	m142	EVELYN	In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
L401161	u2203	m142	CURATOR	To have stopped this creature? Yes!
L401160	u2205	m142	EVELYN	And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
L401153	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
L401152	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What is he doing here?
L401151	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
L400684	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Perhaps.
L400683	u2205	m142	EVELYN	See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
L400665	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
L400664	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
L400663	u2203	m142	CURATOR	When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
L400662	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm sorry, it was an accident.
L400779	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
L400778	u2207	m142	HOOK	It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
L400777	u2203	m142	CURATOR	And burn the map and retrieve the key.
L400776	u2207	m142	HOOK	Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
L400775	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
L400774	u2207	m142	HOOK	The key!? She has the lost key!?
L400772	u2203	m142	CURATOR	No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
L400771	u2207	m142	HOOK	She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
L401237	u2203	m142	CURATOR	If we want to kill the creature, yes.
L401236	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
L401235	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
L401225	u2203	m142	CURATOR	Correct, And that's when --
L401224	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
L401223	u2203	m142	CURATOR	-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
L401222	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
L401163	u2203	m142	CURATOR	According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
L401162	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
L401157	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Try me.
L401156	u2203	m142	CURATOR	You will not believe it.
L401155	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
L401203	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
L401202	u2204	m142	DANIELS	The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
L401180	u2204	m142	DANIELS	Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
L401179	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
L401089	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	What did you do to him!?
L401088	u2204	m142	DANIELS	You bastards!
L401054	u2204	m142	DANIELS	Water turning to blood.
L401053	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	The sun turning black.
L401032	u2204	m142	DANIELS	Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
L401031	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
L400975	u2206	m142	HENDERSON	For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
L400974	u2204	m142	DANIELS	See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
L400900	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
L400899	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
L400798	u2210	m142	WARDEN	I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
L400797	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What are you doing here?
L400796	u2210	m142	WARDEN	A bright good morning to all.
L400767	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Forty.
L400766	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Twenty.
L400765	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Fifty percent.
L400764	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
L400763	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
L400762	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I would never!
L400761	u2210	m142	WARDEN	You lie.
L400753	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Three hundred pounds!
L400752	u2210	m142	WARDEN	Proceed!
L400751	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Two hundred pounds.
L400750	u2210	m142	WARDEN	I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
L400749	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
L400748	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I am an English woman.
L400747	u2210	m142	WARDEN	No women allowed.
L400745	u2210	m142	WARDEN	To be hanged.
L400744	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Where are they taking him?
L400710	u2210	m142	WARDEN	He said... he was just looking for a good time.
L400709	u2205	m142	EVELYN	And what did he say?
L400708	u2210	m142	WARDEN	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
L400707	u2205	m142	EVELYN	And what is he in prison for?
L401255	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
L401254	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Got guts, lady.
L401249	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I have no choice.
L401248	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Don't do it, Evelyn.
L401229	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Got what?
L401228	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Got it!
L401210	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
L401209	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I think you were jealous
L401208	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
L401207	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You called me your girl?
L401143	u2205	m142	EVELYN	The creature!? Are you sure!?
L401142	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
L401115	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	FINE.
L401114	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm staying.
L401113	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
L401112	u2205	m142	EVELYN	That's what I am to you? A contract?
L401111	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
L401110	u2205	m142	EVELYN	It's everybody's problem!
L401109	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
L401108	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
L401107	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
L401106	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
L401104	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
L401103	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
L401102	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
L401100	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No, we are not.
L401099	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
L401098	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
L401058	u2205	m142	EVELYN	It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
L401057	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
L401048	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
L401047	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
L401046	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	That bad huh?
L401045	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
L401042	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Very slowly.
L401041	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
L401020	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
L401019	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Is he supposed to look like that?
L401012	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You dream about dead guys?
L401011	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
L400998	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
L400997	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No... Why?... Should I?
L400992	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Because that's my name.
L400991	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Why would I do that?
L400990	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Not unless you call me Rick.
L400989	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm not?
L400988	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No you're not.
L400987	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
L400985	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	And what is that?
L400984	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
L400983	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
L400982	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
L400981	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Something like that.
L400980	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
L400979	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
L400957	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
L400956	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You don't believe in curses, huh?
L400955	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You two!
L400953	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
L400952	u2205	m142	EVELYN	How?
L400951	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
L400946	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Who was talking about what?
L400945	u2205	m142	EVELYN	A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
L400942	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
L400941	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
L400938	u2205	m142	EVELYN	They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
L400937	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
L400936	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
L400933	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
L400932	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
L400908	u2205	m142	EVELYN	For entering the afterlife.
L400907	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Preparation for what?
L400906	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
L400898	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
L400897	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What are those mirrors for?
L400896	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
L400895	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The things that get you excited.
L400894	u2205	m142	EVELYN	"That ""thing"" gets me excited."
L400880	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We're about to be shown the way.
L400879	u2205	m142	EVELYN	For what?
L400870	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Are you sure?
L400869	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We're almost there.
L400849	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Trust me.
L400848	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
L400847	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Can you swim?
L400843	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh that's comforting.
L400842	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
L400821	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I know my treasure.
L400820	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You know your history.
L400819	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
L400818	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
L400817	u2205	m142	EVELYN	"Ahmar is Ossirion. ""Passageway to the underworld"", actually."
L400816	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	"Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, ""the doorway to hell."""
L400815	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
L400814	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
L400813	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
L400812	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
L400811	u2205	m142	EVELYN	If you call that a kiss.
L400810	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
L400809	u2205	m142	EVELYN	The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
L400808	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
L400769	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
L400768	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
L400741	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Really want to know?
L400740	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes.
L400739	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Want to know?
L400738	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
L400737	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I found sand. I saw death.
L400736	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What did you find? What did you see?
L400735	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
L400734	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No, I mean --
L400733	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Every damn day.
L400732	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You swear?
L400731	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah, I was there.
L400730	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes, well...  I know my brother.
L400729	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I just decked your brother
L400728	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You were actually at Hamunaptra?
L400724	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Because that's where I found it. I was there.
L400723	u2205	m142	EVELYN	How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
L400722	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
L400721	u2205	m142	EVELYN	No?
L400720	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No.
L400719	u2205	m142	EVELYN	We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
L400714	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Broad?!
L400713	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	So who's the broad?
L401353	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes,... I see.
L401352	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
L401350	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What's it look like!?
L401349	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
L401348	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Oh.
L401347	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Finish the inscription, idiot!
L401339	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Read the inscription on the cover!
L401338	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
L401334	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Shut-up and get me off of here!
L401333	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I found it, Evy! I found it
L401022	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
L401021	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Juicy?
L400995	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Well neither do I, thank you.
L400994	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
L400993	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
L400950	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Did you ever see him eat?
L400949	u2205	m142	EVELYN	What do you suppose killed him?
L400931	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Still...
L400930	u2205	m142	EVELYN	It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
L400919	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
L400918	u2205	m142	EVELYN	According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
L400884	u2205	m142	EVELYN	After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
L400883	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
L400785	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
L400784	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
L400783	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Do you really think he'll show up?
L400712	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Way to go, Evy.
L400711	u2205	m142	EVELYN	But he's just a filthy criminal?
L400706	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Picked his pocket, actually.
L400705	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
L400704	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	That just makes you more gullible.
L400703	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I'm your sister.
L400702	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
L400701	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You lied to me!
L400700	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I was mistaken.
L400699	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
L400693	u2205	m142	EVELYN	All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
L400692	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
L400691	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
L400687	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
L400686	u2205	m142	EVELYN	He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
L400685	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
L400682	u2205	m142	EVELYN	I think you found something.
L400681	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes?
L400680	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Jonathan?
L400676	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
L400675	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
L400673	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
L400672	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
L400671	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Right now, I only wish to join them.
L400670	u2205	m142	EVELYN	Have you no respect for the dead?
L400669	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
L400668	u2205	m142	EVELYN	You...! YOU...!
L401346	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	You have got to be joking?
L401345	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
L401298	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Got it.
L401297	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
L401296	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
L401265	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
L401264	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We gotta get her back.
L401232	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	What?
L401231	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	What?
L401216	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
L401215	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
L401200	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And then he'll be coming after Evy.
L401199	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
L401198	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes, I know, I do that to people.
L401197	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
L401196	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	That looked rather painful.
L401139	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
L401138	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Who's here!?
L401063	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
L401062	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
L401044	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
L401043	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
L401035	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
L401034	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	You did not!?... We're not!?
L401029	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
L401028	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	What are you going to do? Shoot him?
L401027	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Where's my gun?
L401015	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
L401014	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Tough break.
L400944	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
L400943	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
L400929	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
L400928	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
L400922	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
L400921	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
L400920	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	None taken.
L400902	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	And it stinks to high heaven in here.
L400901	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
L400893	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Be nice. That thing saved my life.
L400892	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	That thing gives me the creeps.
L400860	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Awfully.
L400859	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
L400858	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
L400857	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
L400800	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	I only gamble with my life, never my money.
L400799	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
L400727	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	Um, well, you see...
L400726	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Hey,... don't I know you?
L400716	u2209	m142	O'CONNELL	Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
L400715	u2208	m142	JONATHAN	She's my sister, actually.
L405150	u2211	m143	AMAZING	What --?
L405149	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
L405148	u2211	m143	AMAZING	And what's that?
L405147	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Except for one little thing.
L405146	u2211	m143	AMAZING	Um-hmm.
L405145	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
L405144	u2211	m143	AMAZING	And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
L405142	u2211	m143	AMAZING	I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...

L405140	u2211	m143	AMAZING	The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
L405138	u2211	m143	AMAZING	Of course.
L405137	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
L405136	u2211	m143	AMAZING	I know you knew I'd know.
L405135	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I knew you'd know.
L405134	u2211	m143	AMAZING	I know you did.
L405133	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
L405786	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
L405785	u2212	m143	ANABEL	Do I?

L405704	u2212	m143	ANABEL	One last tweak.
L405703	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I thought you were done?
L405702	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Fantasizing... about you.
L405701	u2212	m143	ANABEL	What are you doing all alone in the dark?
L405485	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Head hunting.
L405484	u2212	m143	ANABEL	Where are you going?

L405183	u2212	m143	ANABEL	Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
L405182	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Everything's going exactly as we planned.

L405752	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Do it, big boy!
L405751	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Come on, baby!
L405616	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	And some sandwiches --
L405615	u2213	m143	BOWLER	We could really use some coffee --
L405438	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Then Captain Amazing appeared.
L405437	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Much less go outside.
L405406	u2213	m143	BOWLER	I was eight.
L405405	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	When was that?
L405404	u2213	m143	BOWLER	He was the last time I saw him.
L405401	u2213	m143	BOWLER	My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
L405400	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	We didn't think this through very well.
L405318	u2213	m143	BOWLER	The Disco Boys.
L405317	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	So who killed him?
L405316	u2213	m143	BOWLER	And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
L405310	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Really?
L405309	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
L405308	u2213	m143	BOWLER	I'm his daughter.
L405307	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
L405620	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Or even what it looks like.
L405619	u2220	m143	RAJA	But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
L405611	u2220	m143	RAJA	Let's do it.
L405610	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Sounds good to me.
L405603	u2213	m143	BOWLER	They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
L405602	u2220	m143	RAJA	No one will believe us.
L405377	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
L405376	u2220	m143	RAJA	Me, too.
L405375	u2213	m143	BOWLER	It's late. I'm headin' home.
L405370	u2220	m143	RAJA	But in fact... you'd found it.
L405369	u2213	m143	BOWLER	I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
L405368	u2220	m143	RAJA	The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
L405367	u2213	m143	BOWLER	But you're a superhero.
L405366	u2220	m143	RAJA	I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
L405362	u2220	m143	RAJA	I can't.
L405361	u2213	m143	BOWLER	But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
L405332	u2220	m143	RAJA	The Inscrutable Six?
L405331	u2213	m143	BOWLER	How about... the Savage Six?
L405328	u2220	m143	RAJA	But they all had one thing we haven't got.
L405327	u2213	m143	BOWLER	He was cute though.
L405326	u2220	m143	RAJA	And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
L405306	u2213	m143	BOWLER	I'm the Bowler.
L405305	u2220	m143	RAJA	Who are you?
L405845	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
L405844	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Eat your mustard.
L405666	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Sure.
L405665	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Hey... you okay?
L405647	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Hello?
L405646	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Mon Captain, it's for you. 
L405537	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	I dunno.
L405536	u2213	m143	BOWLER	What did he mean?
L405535	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
L405323	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Half a Dirty Dozen!
L405322	u2213	m143	BOWLER	That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
L405314	u2213	m143	BOWLER	I thought you'd never ask.
L405313	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
L405780	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Think positive.
L405779	u2216	m143	HELLER	He'll never make it.
L405685	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Get on to yourself!
L405684	u2216	m143	HELLER	Snap out of it!
L405417	u2216	m143	HELLER	Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
L405416	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
L405415	u2216	m143	HELLER	Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
L405414	u2213	m143	BOWLER	He's dead.
L405413	u2216	m143	HELLER	How's your dad?
L405412	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Thanks.
L405411	u2216	m143	HELLER	Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
L405410	u2213	m143	BOWLER	It's me... Elizabeth.
L405409	u2216	m143	HELLER	Yes!
L405408	u2213	m143	BOWLER	Doctor Heller?
L405407	u2216	m143	HELLER	Yes!
L405357	u2223	m143	TONY P	And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
L405356	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	That boy's got talent.
L405202	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Why bother?
L405201	u2223	m143	TONY P	Should I kill them?
L405200	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Superheroes.
L405131	u2223	m143	TONY P	What about Captain Amazing?
L405130	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I got it.
L405129	u2223	m143	TONY P	But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
L405128	u2223	m143	TONY P	You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
L405127	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Have you considered my offer?
L405126	u2223	m143	TONY P	Ummm.
L405125	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
L405801	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
L405800	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
L405798	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Frankenstein!
L405797	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	And the light goes out...
L405523	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	So are you!
L405522	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	You're dead.
L405521	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
L405519	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Too bad. PLUG HIM!
L405518	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Against.
L405517	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Are you with me... or against me?
L405516	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	And the nuts always call themselves great.
L405515	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	They always call the great ones nuts.
L405514	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	You're nuts.
L405513	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
L405346	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Captain who?
L405345	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	What did you do with Captain Amazing?
L405720	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Or you'll what? CAN ME?
L405719	u2218	m143	MONICA	Stay away!
L405717	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Roy.
L405716	u2218	m143	MONICA	Who?
L405715	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I saw him walk you home.
L405714	u2218	m143	MONICA	What?
L405713	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	You're a spy.
L405712	u2218	m143	MONICA	I'd better go.
L405700	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Remember the cat.
L405699	u2218	m143	MONICA	Curiosity.
L405698	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Then why are you here?
L405697	u2218	m143	MONICA	I'm not that kind of girl.
L405696	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Come here.
L405675	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Me.
L405674	u2218	m143	MONICA	Who's the artist?
L405671	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Why not?
L405670	u2218	m143	MONICA	"How 'bout giving me ""the tour""?"
L405669	u2218	m143	MONICA	Just wanted to... powder my nose.
L405668	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I thought you'd chickened out on me.
L405667	u2218	m143	MONICA	Hi.
L405564	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Terrific.
L405563	u2218	m143	MONICA	Sure -- I guess.
L405562	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
L405561	u2218	m143	MONICA	Really?
L405560	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
L405559	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	You underestimate yourself.
L405558	u2218	m143	MONICA	Just a waitress.
L405557	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	Are you an actress?
L405556	u2218	m143	MONICA	Really?
L405555	u2214	m143	CASANOVA	"I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in ""The Blue Dahlia""."
L405662	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Monica!
L405661	u2218	m143	MONICA	Bye. 
L405660	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	What?
L405659	u2218	m143	MONICA	Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
L405658	u2218	m143	MONICA	Then at least I will have died trying, right?
L405657	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	And what if you get killed?
L405656	u2218	m143	MONICA	Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
L405655	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
L405654	u2218	m143	MONICA	Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
L405653	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	What are you talking about?
L405652	u2218	m143	MONICA	I'm going inside.
L405651	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Are you nuts? Get out of there!
L405650	u2218	m143	MONICA	At the Frankenstein Center.
L405649	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Monica, where are you?
L405648	u2218	m143	MONICA	It's me.
L405508	u2218	m143	MONICA	That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
L405507	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	I just want to be a superhero.
L405506	u2218	m143	MONICA	You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
L405505	u2218	m143	MONICA	You don't seem very angry right now.
L405504	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Me, too.
L405503	u2218	m143	MONICA	Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
L405502	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	What have they got that we ain't got?
L405501	u2218	m143	MONICA	I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
L405500	u2218	m143	MONICA	Yeah.
L405499	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	It's home.
L405498	u2218	m143	MONICA	Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
L405497	u2218	m143	MONICA	Have you always lived here?
L405496	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Roy.
L405495	u2218	m143	MONICA	What's your real name?
L405494	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
L405493	u2218	m143	MONICA	I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
L405492	u2218	m143	MONICA	Who wouldn't?
L405491	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	I wouldn't mind being famous.
L405490	u2218	m143	MONICA	Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
L405489	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	It is?
L405488	u2218	m143	MONICA	Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
L405487	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Why?
L405486	u2218	m143	MONICA	I admire you.
L405480	u2218	m143	MONICA	That was easy. 
L405479	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Sure.
L405478	u2218	m143	MONICA	I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
L405477	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Yeah.
L405476	u2218	m143	MONICA	Date?
L405475	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
L405468	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Every night.
L405467	u2218	m143	MONICA	Alone tonight?
L405466	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Hi.
L405100	u2218	m143	MONICA	Not tonight. 
L405099	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Or talk?
L405097	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
L405096	u2218	m143	MONICA	I guess... Are you always so angry?
L405095	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
L405276	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Good or evil, what's the difference?
L405275	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
L405249	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
L405248	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
L405247	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	I just know.
L405246	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
L405239	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.
L405238	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
L405235	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.
L405234	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
L405678	u2222	m143	SPHINX	He is in love. His anger is gone.
L405677	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
L405609	u2222	m143	SPHINX	Now you're talking.
L405608	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
L405607	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
L405452	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
L405451	u2222	m143	SPHINX	It is not dead. It is hiding.
L405450	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	My heart died a long time ago.
L405449	u2222	m143	SPHINX	Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
L405446	u2222	m143	SPHINX	When I am sure I am among friends.
L405445	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	When are you going to take off that mask?
L405444	u2222	m143	SPHINX	You drink too much.
L405443	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	And a skunk stinks!
L405442	u2222	m143	SPHINX	The wise snake coils before he strikes.
L405441	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
L405391	u2222	m143	SPHINX	And you are a fool.
L405390	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	You're the Sphinx.
L405763	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	With what?
L405762	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Cover me!
L405725	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Not a chance!
L405724	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	I'll drive.
L405723	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Are you coming or not?
L405722	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	But she still might call!
L405695	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
L405694	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
L405687	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	But I just don't feel it.
L405686	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	GET MAD!
L405544	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Because that's what it is.
L405543	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	This place is built like a fortress.
L405396	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	He's got the fact that he's Superman!
L405395	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	So what else has Superman got?
L405321	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	SO WHAT?
L405320	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	But there's still only six of us.
L405319	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
L405278	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
L405277	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	There's a big difference.
L405260	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
L405259	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	There's just not enough of us.
L405233	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Yeah.
L405232	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	You sure that's how you spell it?
L405225	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Good point.
L405224	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	How could I see him if he's invisible?
L405223	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Have you ever seen him?
L405218	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
L405217	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	I'm liking this.
L405214	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
L405213	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	And it would be the right thing to do.
L405210	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
L405209	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	What are you talking about?
L405068	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	So when are we gonna have an on night?
L405067	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	We had an off night, that's all.
L405066	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
L405050	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	LOOK!
L405049	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Oh don't start that again --
L405689	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
L405688	u2220	m143	RAJA	He's turned into a completely normal person!
L405546	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Come on.
L405545	u2220	m143	RAJA	What's that?
L405542	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	He hasn't stolen it yet.
L405541	u2220	m143	RAJA	So where's the art?
L405448	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
L405447	u2220	m143	RAJA	Roy --
L405280	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Oh shut up.
L405279	u2220	m143	RAJA	Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
L405274	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
L405273	u2220	m143	RAJA	Maybe there was traffic.
L405230	u2220	m143	RAJA	No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
L405229	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Sounds good.
L405216	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
L405215	u2220	m143	RAJA	But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
L405212	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
L405211	u2220	m143	RAJA	Agents?
L405208	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
L405207	u2220	m143	RAJA	Maybe she's right.
L405192	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Shhh.
L405191	u2220	m143	RAJA	I'm soaked.  Oh great.
L405176	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Well they've crawled back out.
L405175	u2220	m143	RAJA	The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
L405174	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	The who?
L405170	u2220	m143	RAJA	Wait!... Look!
L405169	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Let's go.
L405162	u2220	m143	RAJA	But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
L405161	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
L405104	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	See ya tomorrow.
L405103	u2220	m143	RAJA	Or flowers.
L405102	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
L405101	u2220	m143	RAJA	Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
L405094	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Who's chicken? 
L405093	u2220	m143	RAJA	So you're chicken?
L405092	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
L405091	u2220	m143	RAJA	Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
L405090	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Nah.
L405065	u2220	m143	RAJA	Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
L405064	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Why not?
L405063	u2220	m143	RAJA	I can't.
L405062	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	So why don't you just tell her!
L405061	u2220	m143	RAJA	I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
L405060	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
L405058	u2220	m143	RAJA	But look at him... and look at us.
L405057	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
L405053	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
L405052	u2220	m143	RAJA	There's a vague similarity.
L405051	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
L405048	u2215	m143	FURIOUS	What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
L405047	u2220	m143	RAJA	He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
L405847	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	Hey... he's gone.
L405846	u2220	m143	RAJA	Yes, Obie-wan.
L405399	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	Anybody got any?
L405398	u2220	m143	RAJA	Firepower costs money.
L405336	u2220	m143	RAJA	The Eradicators!
L405335	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	The Obliterators!
L405245	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.
L405244	u2220	m143	RAJA	So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
L405241	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	No.
L405240	u2220	m143	RAJA	So you're only invisible... to yourself?
L405237	u2217	m143	INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.
L405236	u2220	m143	RAJA	But... only when no one is looking.
L405205	u2218	m143	MONICA	Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
L405204	u2220	m143	RAJA	Ow.
L405203	u2218	m143	MONICA	Here you go. 
L405086	u2220	m143	RAJA	Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
L405085	u2218	m143	MONICA	So what can I get you?
L405084	u2220	m143	RAJA	Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
L405083	u2218	m143	MONICA	Really?
L405080	u2220	m143	RAJA	And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
L405079	u2218	m143	MONICA	Wow.
L405078	u2220	m143	RAJA	We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
L405077	u2218	m143	MONICA	So you're like... struggling superheroes?
L405076	u2220	m143	RAJA	Not yet.
L405075	u2218	m143	MONICA	Are you famous?
L405074	u2218	m143	MONICA	Really? Like Captain Amazing?
L405073	u2220	m143	RAJA	We're superheroes.
L405072	u2218	m143	MONICA	You guys going to a costume party?
L405640	u2219	m143	MOTHER	Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
L405639	u2220	m143	RAJA	You did?
L405638	u2219	m143	MOTHER	I always knew that you were special.
L405637	u2220	m143	RAJA	It is?
L405636	u2219	m143	MOTHER	Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
L405635	u2220	m143	RAJA	I use it... to fight evil.
L405634	u2219	m143	MOTHER	But... the silverware?
L405633	u2220	m143	RAJA	Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
L405632	u2220	m143	RAJA	Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
L405631	u2219	m143	MOTHER	And why are you wearing that silly costume?
L405630	u2220	m143	RAJA	Mother... it's not what you think!
L405629	u2219	m143	MOTHER	Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
L405121	u2220	m143	RAJA	Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
L405120	u2219	m143	MOTHER	It's on the television.
L405119	u2220	m143	RAJA	Looking for... the TV Guide.
L405118	u2219	m143	MOTHER	What are you doing in the silver drawer?
L405117	u2220	m143	RAJA	Oh hi, Mom.
L405116	u2219	m143	MOTHER	Jeffrey!
L405759	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Right.
L405758	u2220	m143	RAJA	Through there!
L405757	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Where am I going?
L405731	u2220	m143	RAJA	May the forks be with us!
L405730	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	We've got lift off!
L405709	u2220	m143	RAJA	With or without him, we gotta go!
L405708	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	It's time.
L405680	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Great timing!
L405679	u2220	m143	RAJA	Oh no.
L405606	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	It's suicide.
L405605	u2220	m143	RAJA	We're outnumbered twenty to one.
L405567	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
L405566	u2220	m143	RAJA	That was too close.
L405539	u2220	m143	RAJA	But how do we get in?
L405538	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
L405440	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
L405439	u2220	m143	RAJA	He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
L405436	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
L405435	u2220	m143	RAJA	Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
L405422	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	The bazookas?
L405421	u2220	m143	RAJA	But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
L405403	u2220	m143	RAJA	Are you sure he's still alive?
L405402	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Are you sure he's still lives here?
L405359	u2220	m143	RAJA	Whatever our name is.
L405358	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	To us!
L405262	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Yeah, but how do we get to them?
L405261	u2220	m143	RAJA	And a social life.
L405228	u2220	m143	RAJA	He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
L405227	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	The who?
L405226	u2220	m143	RAJA	And there's the Sphinx.
L405222	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
L405221	u2220	m143	RAJA	Do we have to?
L405194	u2220	m143	RAJA	Shut up.
L405193	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Be a Mohican.
L405189	u2220	m143	RAJA	Be a Mohican. 
L405188	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Sorry.
L405187	u2220	m143	RAJA	Don't crunch the leaves.
L405180	u2220	m143	RAJA	Or both.
L405179	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Or Batman --
L405178	u2220	m143	RAJA	This looks like a job for Superman --
L405177	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	We may be getting in over our heads here.
L405173	u2220	m143	RAJA	The Disco Boys.
L405172	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Who are they?
L405171	u2220	m143	RAJA	This is bad.
L405089	u2220	m143	RAJA	Ask her out.
L405088	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Definitely.
L405087	u2220	m143	RAJA	She likes you.
L405082	u2220	m143	RAJA	And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
L405081	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Hi.
L405056	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
L405055	u2220	m143	RAJA	We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
L405054	u2221	m143	SHOVELER	Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
L439849	u2460	m158	ELLIE	He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
L439848	u2461	m158	JUD	Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
L439767	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Is that right, dad?
L439766	u2461	m158	JUD	They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
L439548	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yes--
L439547	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
L439546	u2460	m158	ELLIE	What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
L439543	u2461	m158	JUD	It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
L439542	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Well...I guess not.
L439541	u2461	m158	JUD	Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
L439532	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh.
L439531	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Bite?
L439530	u2461	m158	JUD	Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
L439512	u2461	m158	JUD	You'll see soon enough, hon.
L439511	u2460	m158	ELLIE	But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
L439464	u2461	m158	JUD	And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
L439463	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
L439462	u2461	m158	JUD	Who might you be, little Miss?
L439942	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I will. Come and kiss me.
L439941	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Please hurry.
L439921	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Of course I will.
L439920	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
L439919	u2464	m158	RACHEL	There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
L439918	u2460	m158	ELLIE	He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
L439917	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
L439916	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
L439909	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
L439908	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Ellie...Ellie...what...
L439907	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Paxcow says it's almost too late!
L439838	u2464	m158	RACHEL	In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
L439837	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
L439574	u2460	m158	ELLIE	But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
L439573	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Honey, Church will be fine.
L439438	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yaay!
L439437	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Yes, but the rope might be--
L439434	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Am I really gonna have my own room?
L439433	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It's gorgeous!
L439903	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I swear.
L439902	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Do you swear?
L439900	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
L439899	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
L439898	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
L439851	u2460	m158	ELLIE	And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
L439850	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie--
L439808	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
L439807	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Then why do I have to go to bed?
L439806	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm sure you're not.
L439805	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I'm not tired!
L439802	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
L439801	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yeah, sure.
L439800	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
L439799	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I don't get it.
L439798	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
L439797	u2460	m158	ELLIE	You believe in it.
L439796	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
L439795	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Do you believe that?
L439794	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
L439793	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
L439792	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
L439791	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
L439790	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But don't you dare say that.
L439789	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
L439788	u2460	m158	ELLIE	At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
L439787	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
L439786	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What's up, sugar?
L439784	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
L439783	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Huh?
L439782	u2460	m158	ELLIE	No more chocolate chip cookies.
L439781	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie? What's wrong?
L439772	u2462	m158	LOUIS	That's enough, Ellen.
L439771	u2460	m158	ELLIE	She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
L439763	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I hate that smell.
L439762	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
L439759	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I know.
L439758	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Because you promised.
L439757	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439756	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Is he really all right?
L439755	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
L439754	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
L439708	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
L439707	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
L439572	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
L439571	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Good God! Where'd you hear that?
L439559	u2460	m158	ELLIE	It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
L439558	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
L439557	u2460	m158	ELLIE	In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
L439556	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
L439555	u2460	m158	ELLIE	That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
L439550	u2460	m158	ELLIE	To remember.
L439549	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
L439534	u2462	m158	LOUIS	For a little while.
L439533	u2460	m158	ELLIE	I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
L439529	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Well, I thought it was safe--
L439528	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
L439468	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yayyy!
L439467	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No-I guess not.
L439449	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
L439448	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
L439436	u2460	m158	ELLIE	Yaay!
L439435	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439933	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't bother. I'm coming home.
L439932	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
L439931	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Was it Pascow?
L439930	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
L439929	u2461	m158	JUD	No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
L439522	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
L439521	u2464	m158	RACHEL	How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
L439466	u2461	m158	JUD	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
L439465	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
L439461	u2461	m158	JUD	No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
L439460	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
L439459	u2461	m158	JUD	Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
L439869	u2461	m158	JUD	Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
L439868	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
L439866	u2461	m158	JUD	And because the dead walked.
L439865	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
L439864	u2461	m158	JUD	I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
L439863	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
L439862	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Shit! Look at this mess!
L439861	u2461	m158	JUD	--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
L439859	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm thinking about going to bed.
L439858	u2461	m158	JUD	You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
L439857	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
L439845	u2461	m158	JUD	Louis--
L439844	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
L439843	u2461	m158	JUD	Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
L439780	u2461	m158	JUD	Nope. He's your cat now.
L439779	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's Ellie's cat.
L439778	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
L439777	u2462	m158	LOUIS	"My father used to have a saying, Jud-- ""God sees the truth, but waits."""
L439776	u2461	m158	JUD	Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
L439774	u2462	m158	LOUIS	This babe has said enough.
L439773	u2461	m158	JUD	Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
L439770	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well...a touch of the flu...
L439769	u2461	m158	JUD	Rachel not feeling well?
L439744	u2461	m158	JUD	Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
L439743	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What?
L439742	u2461	m158	JUD	A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
L439741	u2461	m158	JUD	She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
L439740	u2462	m158	LOUIS	A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
L439739	u2461	m158	JUD	Why, then, things should be fine.
L439738	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439737	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
L439735	u2461	m158	JUD	Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
L439734	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You and this old Indian rag-man--
L439732	u2461	m158	JUD	Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
L439731	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Wendigo?
L439730	u2461	m158	JUD	They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
L439728	u2461	m158	JUD	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
L439727	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Can I have another one?
L439726	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
L439725	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
L439724	u2461	m158	JUD	Wouldn't wash?
L439723	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
L439722	u2461	m158	JUD	Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
L439721	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What did we do, Jud?
L439720	u2461	m158	JUD	I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
L439704	u2461	m158	JUD	No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
L439703	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But--
L439697	u2461	m158	JUD	Because it's right.
L439696	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, why am I doing all this?
L439695	u2461	m158	JUD	Don't worry about that.
L439694	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Doesn't look like they last long.
L439693	u2461	m158	JUD	Your cairn.
L439692	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What are those for?
L439689	u2461	m158	JUD	Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
L439688	u2462	m158	LOUIS	No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
L439687	u2461	m158	JUD	You want to rest a bit before you start?
L439686	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I guess so...but...
L439685	u2461	m158	JUD	I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
L439684	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Why? For God's sake, why?
L439683	u2461	m158	JUD	The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
L439682	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Whose burying ground?
L439681	u2461	m158	JUD	This was their burying ground, Louis.
L439680	u2461	m158	JUD	This time I mean it.
L439679	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You keep saying that.
L439678	u2461	m158	JUD	Almost there, Louis.
L439677	u2461	m158	JUD	Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
L439676	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's funny, all right.
L439675	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You're telling me.
L439674	u2461	m158	JUD	There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
L439672	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh.
L439671	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Is there quicksand?
L439670	u2461	m158	JUD	Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
L439668	u2461	m158	JUD	You'll see before long. Let's go.
L439667	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
L439666	u2461	m158	JUD	No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
L439660	u2461	m158	JUD	Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
L439659	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm not climbing that.
L439658	u2461	m158	JUD	No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
L439657	u2462	m158	LOUIS	We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
L439656	u2461	m158	JUD	The place we're going is on the other side of that.
L439655	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What do you mean?
L439654	u2461	m158	JUD	We're still not where we're going.
L439653	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
L439652	u2461	m158	JUD	What say, Louis?
L439650	u2461	m158	JUD	Then come on.
L439649	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes, but--
L439648	u2461	m158	JUD	Does she love the cat?
L439647	u2462	m158	LOUIS	But--
L439646	u2461	m158	JUD	It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
L439645	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
L439644	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
L439643	u2461	m158	JUD	No need to apologize.
L439641	u2461	m158	JUD	Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
L439640	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't know.
L439639	u2461	m158	JUD	Going to tell Ellie?
L439638	u2461	m158	JUD	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
L439637	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Bagged cat. What a mess.
L439636	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes.
L439635	u2461	m158	JUD	Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
L439634	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
L439633	u2461	m158	JUD	I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
L439632	u2462	m158	LOUIS	It's Church.
L439631	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
L439630	u2461	m158	JUD	Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
L439629	u2462	m158	LOUIS	For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
L439628	u2461	m158	JUD	Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
L439553	u2461	m158	JUD	Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
L439552	u2462	m158	LOUIS	My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
L439545	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think it is so, Ellie.
L439544	u2461	m158	JUD	No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
L439536	u2461	m158	JUD	Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
L439535	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I can hardly read these.
L439516	u2461	m158	JUD	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
L439515	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Not yet...how much further is it?
L439514	u2461	m158	JUD	Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
L439513	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
L439510	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Sure.
L439509	u2461	m158	JUD	You folks ready to go on?
L439502	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What's at the end of it?
L439501	u2461	m158	JUD	That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
L439500	u2462	m158	LOUIS	The one that goes into the woods--sure.
L439499	u2461	m158	JUD	I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
L439498	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Nice.
L439495	u2461	m158	JUD	The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
L439494	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What?
L439493	u2461	m158	JUD	Allman Brothers.
L439492	u2462	m158	LOUIS	What were you listening to?
L439491	u2461	m158	JUD	Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
L439490	u2462	m158	LOUIS	God, that's fine.
L439489	u2461	m158	JUD	Good for you.
L439488	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Not at all.
L439487	u2461	m158	JUD	You need a glass?
L439472	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, maybe I----
L439471	u2461	m158	JUD	Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
L439470	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Hey--they actually found the place!
L439914	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
L439913	u2463	m158	PASCOW	Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
L439912	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
L439747	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You don't understand--
L439746	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
L439624	u2463	m158	PASCOW	Remember.
L439623	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Leave me alone!
L439622	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
L439621	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
L439620	u2463	m158	PASCOW	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
L439619	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
L439890	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I'm sure.
L439889	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Louis, are you sure?
L439888	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
L439887	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
L439886	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You better get going, hon.
L439819	u2462	m158	LOUIS	You're doing fine.
L439818	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm going to try to do better.
L439817	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes, I guess I do.
L439816	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
L439815	u2462	m158	LOUIS	That's forgotten.
L439814	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
L439811	u2464	m158	RACHEL	That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
L439810	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
L439809	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I heard you tonight.
L439627	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Good d--
L439626	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I got eggs down here!
L439625	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Getting there.
L439586	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
L439585	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Thank you, Louis.
L439583	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
L439582	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, honey...you know that...
L439581	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And Church will be fine.
L439580	u2464	m158	RACHEL	You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
L439579	u2464	m158	RACHEL	I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
L439578	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I just said--
L439577	u2464	m158	RACHEL	That's enough of that kind of talk!
L439576	u2462	m158	LOUIS	According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
L439575	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
L439565	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
L439564	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
L439563	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
L439562	u2462	m158	LOUIS	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
L439561	u2464	m158	RACHEL	She's finally asleep.
L439524	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
L439523	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I think it's rather extraordinary.
L439508	u2464	m158	RACHEL	It's beautiful!
L439507	u2462	m158	LOUIS	My God!
L439483	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Did you see his shirt?
L439482	u2464	m158	RACHEL	---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
L439481	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
L439480	u2464	m158	RACHEL	You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
L439477	u2462	m158	LOUIS	I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
L439476	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
L439475	u2462	m158	LOUIS	The movers--
L439458	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
L439457	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Thank you. Thank you so much.
L439454	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Jesus, the road!
L439453	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Gage's gone!
L439443	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Come on--let's parole 'em.
L439442	u2462	m158	LOUIS	And Buckaroo Banzai.
L439440	u2464	m158	RACHEL	Louis, the house is beautiful.
L439439	u2462	m158	LOUIS	Let her go. It's cool.
L442427	u2470	m159	JACK	Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
L442426	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	Aye, aye, sir!
L442425	u2470	m159	JACK	AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
L442088	u2470	m159	JACK	They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
L442087	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	How does he do that?
L442020	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	I will.
L442019	u2470	m159	JACK	You'll get it back.  Or one better.
L442018	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	That boat is my livelihood!
L442017	u2470	m159	JACK	Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
L442016	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
L442014	u2470	m159	JACK	AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
L442013	u2465	m159	ANAMARIA	You stole my boat.
L442403	u2476	m159	WILL	He didn't waste it.
L442402	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
L442214	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
L442213	u2476	m159	WILL	No!  You gave your word!
L442208	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
L442207	u2476	m159	WILL	You must swear by the Holy Bible.
L442204	u2476	m159	WILL	And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
L442203	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	We got that part.  Anything else?
L442202	u2476	m159	WILL	Elizabeth goes free!
L442201	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Enough of that!  Name your terms.
L442194	u2476	m159	WILL	You can't.  I can.
L442193	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
L442192	u2476	m159	WILL	She.  Goes.  Free.
L442191	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	What's in your head, boy?
L442400	u2470	m159	JACK	Or you could surrender.
L442399	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
L442394	u2470	m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L442393	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
L442375	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Aye, for us there is.
L442374	u2470	m159	JACK	There's ... another exit?
L442372	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Men!  Are you up for it?
L442371	u2470	m159	JACK	Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
L442369	u2470	m159	JACK	Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
L442368	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That so?
L442367	u2470	m159	JACK	The situation has changed.
L442366	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
L442365	u2470	m159	JACK	Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
L442363	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	What're you suggesting?
L442362	u2470	m159	JACK	You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
L442357	u2470	m159	JACK	Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
L442356	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Why don't I want to do this?
L442355	u2470	m159	JACK	All right then.
L442354	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No, I really think I do.
L442226	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That's fair.
L442225	u2470	m159	JACK	You can go to your grave not knowing.
L442224	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	So how did you get off that island, anyway?
L442219	u2470	m159	JACK	The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
L442218	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You'd best take a swim, Jack.
L442217	u2470	m159	JACK	Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
L442216	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
L442215	u2470	m159	JACK	It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
L442164	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
L442163	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll watch my back.
L442162	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
L442161	u2470	m159	JACK	What -- you don't have the medallion?
L442159	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
L442158	u2470	m159	JACK	See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
L442157	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
L442155	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Track you down and --
L442154	u2470	m159	JACK	Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
L442153	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
L442152	u2470	m159	JACK	Wait as long as you like.
L442151	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
L442150	u2470	m159	JACK	You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
L442149	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I'll torture it out of you.
L442148	u2470	m159	JACK	You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
L442146	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I'm supposed to ... trust you?
L442145	u2470	m159	JACK	That's right.
L442144	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
L442143	u2470	m159	JACK	You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
L442142	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
L442141	u2470	m159	JACK	Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
L442140	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
L442137	u2470	m159	JACK	No you won't.
L442136	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Say the name, or I slit your throat.
L442135	u2470	m159	JACK	I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
L442361	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
L442360	u2474	m159	PINTEL	Do you believe him?
L442339	u2474	m159	PINTEL	I guess there is a reason to fret.
L442338	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
L442337	u2474	m159	PINTEL	No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
L442221	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
L442220	u2474	m159	PINTEL	That's proper, sir, according to the code.
L442200	u2474	m159	PINTEL	And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
L442199	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
L442139	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now.  No, don't kill him.
L442138	u2474	m159	PINTEL	Now?
L442206	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Will -- you can't trust him.
L442205	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
L442090	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
L442089	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	The curse drove you to gather this?
L441974	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
L441973	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It's a pirate medallion.
L441972	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Do you not know what this is, then?
L441971	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Would that I could.
L441970	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Then why aren't you eating?
L441969	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
L441964	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
L441963	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
L441962	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Maid or not, it fits you.
L441862	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
L441861	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Can I trust you?
L441860	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
L441859	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
L441858	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
L441857	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Thank you, sir.
L441856	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You've got sand, for a maid.
L441855	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
L441854	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	You have a name, missy?
L441851	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	Did you, now?
L441850	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
L441849	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
L441848	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I'll drop it!
L441847	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Very well.
L441846	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
L441845	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I want you to leave.  And never come back.
L441844	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
L441843	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
L441842	u2466	m159	BARBOSSA	My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
L442309	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
L442308	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	That would hardly be proper.
L442307	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Then I can wear men's clothing.
L442306	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
L442304	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I know where your heart truly lies.
L442303	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What?
L442302	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
L442299	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Not as a condition -- a request.
L442298	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
L442297	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
L442294	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, please!
L442293	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
L442292	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	No.  The pirates have taken Will --
L442289	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
L442288	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You're speaking up for him again?
L442287	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, you can't do that!
L442286	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
L441758	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
L441757	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
L441744	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
L441743	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
L441712	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I'm a bit nervous, myself --
L441711	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I can't breathe.
L441710	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
L441623	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Very good.
L441622	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
L441621	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Did he speak?
L441607	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
L441606	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Boy overboard!
L441605	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Man overboard!
L441597	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
L441596	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
L441650	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	About the day we met. Do you remember?
L441649	u2475	m159	SWANN	Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
L441638	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
L441637	u2475	m159	SWANN	I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
L441636	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Difficult ... to say.
L441634	u2475	m159	SWANN	Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
L441633	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I knew it.
L441632	u2475	m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
L441631	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Ceremony?
L441630	u2475	m159	SWANN	Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
L441629	u2475	m159	SWANN	Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
L441628	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
L441625	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes -- yes.
L441624	u2475	m159	SWANN	Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
L441602	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, father.
L441601	u2475	m159	SWANN	And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
L441600	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Actually, I find it all fascinating.
L441960	u2474	m159	PINTEL	He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
L441959	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
L441958	u2474	m159	PINTEL	You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
L441819	u2474	m159	PINTEL	It would appear, so do you.
L441818	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
L441817	u2474	m159	PINTEL	I know the code.
L441816	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
L441815	u2474	m159	PINTEL	What?
L442413	u2476	m159	WILL	-- but that was not a proper kiss.
L442412	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	It doesn't!
L442411	u2476	m159	WILL	Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
L442410	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
L442172	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
L442171	u2476	m159	WILL	I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
L442170	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	-- then we never would have met.
L442169	u2476	m159	WILL	If I had known --
L442168	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
L442167	u2476	m159	WILL	Why would my father send this to me?
L442123	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
L442122	u2476	m159	WILL	I'm glad we got here in time.
L441653	u2476	m159	WILL	At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
L441652	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
L441651	u2476	m159	WILL	I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
L442324	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What's your plan?
L442323	u2470	m159	JACK	I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
L442322	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
L442321	u2470	m159	JACK	Exactly.
L442320	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
L442319	u2470	m159	JACK	Nor did you, I noticed.
L442318	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
L442283	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Exactly.
L442282	u2470	m159	JACK	You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
L442281	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
L442280	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
L442279	u2470	m159	JACK	Why?
L442278	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Yes, the rum is gone.
L442277	u2470	m159	JACK	What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
L442276	u2470	m159	JACK	To the Black Pearl.
L442275	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	To freedom.
L442274	u2470	m159	JACK	We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
L442273	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
L442272	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
L442271	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
L442269	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
L442268	u2470	m159	JACK	When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
L442262	u2470	m159	JACK	More to drink!
L442261	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
L442260	u2470	m159	JACK	Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
L442259	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	That was before I met one, of course.
L442258	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
L442257	u2470	m159	JACK	I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
L442256	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
L442255	u2470	m159	JACK	What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
L442254	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
L442251	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Not when you can drink instead, at least.
L442250	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
L442249	u2470	m159	JACK	You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
L442248	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
L442247	u2470	m159	JACK	You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
L442246	u2470	m159	JACK	Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
L442245	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
L442244	u2470	m159	JACK	Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
L442243	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	But ... you did it before!  Last time --
L442242	u2470	m159	JACK	It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
L442241	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
L442239	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
L442238	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
L442235	u2470	m159	JACK	The trees are taller.
L442234	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Has it changed since the last time you were here?
L442126	u2470	m159	JACK	No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
L442125	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Come on!
L442118	u2470	m159	JACK	No, I'm -- rescuing you.
L442117	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You're in league with Barbossa!
L442116	u2470	m159	JACK	Me!
L442115	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You?!
L441755	u2470	m159	JACK	I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
L441754	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	You are despicable.
L441752	u2470	m159	JACK	Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
L441751	u2467	m159	ELIZABETH	Miss Swann.
L442078	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
L442077	u2468	m159	GIBBS	How did you get off the island?
L442059	u2470	m159	JACK	We're catching up!
L442058	u2468	m159	GIBBS	What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
L442057	u2470	m159	JACK	She can hold a bit longer.
L442056	u2468	m159	GIBBS	We'd best drop canvas, sir!
L442044	u2470	m159	JACK	That he is.
L442043	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
L442040	u2468	m159	GIBBS	And you've got that, have you?
L442039	u2470	m159	JACK	Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
L442038	u2468	m159	GIBBS	A fool's errand.
L442037	u2470	m159	JACK	Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
L442036	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
L442035	u2470	m159	JACK	I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
L442034	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Say again?
L442032	u2470	m159	JACK	Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
L442031	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
L442030	u2470	m159	JACK	First -- have you found me a crew?
L442029	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
L442025	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Aye, that'll about do it.
L442024	u2470	m159	JACK	Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
L442023	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
L442188	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
L442187	u2476	m159	WILL	We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
L442186	u2468	m159	GIBBS	That we are.
L442185	u2476	m159	WILL	We're not going to just surrender!
L442184	u2468	m159	GIBBS	It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
L442074	u2476	m159	WILL	How did he get off the island?
L442073	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
L442072	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
L442071	u2476	m159	WILL	What?  He never told me that.
L442070	u2468	m159	GIBBS	I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
L442069	u2476	m159	WILL	Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
L442068	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
L442067	u2476	m159	WILL	How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
L442027	u2476	m159	WILL	I know.  That was for the smell.
L442026	u2468	m159	GIBBS	Blast it, I'm already awake!
L442422	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I don't think that will be necessary.
L442421	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
L442384	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
L442383	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
L441952	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
L441951	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
L441950	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
L441949	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
L441948	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Raise the sails.
L441927	u2470	m159	JACK	As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
L441926	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
L441925	u2470	m159	JACK	Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
L441924	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
L441923	u2470	m159	JACK	We'll see about that.
L441922	u2469	m159	GILLETTE	You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
L441921	u2470	m159	JACK	Dead serious.
L441702	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	I said, no lies.
L441701	u2470	m159	JACK	None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
L441698	u2470	m159	JACK	Smith.
L441697	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	What's your name?
L441676	u2470	m159	JACK	That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
L441675	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
L441674	u2470	m159	JACK	That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
L441668	u2470	m159	JACK	This must be some important boat.
L441667	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
L441666	u2470	m159	JACK	Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
L441665	u2470	m159	JACK	Sorry, I didn't know.
L441664	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	This dock is off-limits to civilians.
L442336	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
L442335	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I'll be at the wheel myself.
L442334	u2470	m159	JACK	That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
L442333	u2470	m159	JACK	I knew you'd listen to reason!
L442332	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
L442331	u2470	m159	JACK	They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
L442330	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	You would do that?
L442329	u2470	m159	JACK	Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
L442328	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
L442296	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
L442295	u2470	m159	JACK	Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
L442291	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
L442290	u2470	m159	JACK	We had time to get to know each other.
L441746	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Indeed.
L441745	u2470	m159	JACK	But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
L441741	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah, but you have heard of me.
L441740	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
L441733	u2470	m159	JACK	Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
L441732	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
L442405	u2470	m159	JACK	The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
L442404	u2476	m159	WILL	Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
L442359	u2470	m159	JACK	-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
L442358	u2476	m159	WILL	Jack!
L442348	u2470	m159	JACK	It's the right way.
L442347	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you certain this is the right way?
L442346	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
L442345	u2476	m159	WILL	Jack!
L442344	u2470	m159	JACK	Do you have any idea where you're going?
L442197	u2476	m159	WILL	My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
L442196	u2470	m159	JACK	Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
L442131	u2470	m159	JACK	I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
L442130	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
L442129	u2470	m159	JACK	Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
L442128	u2470	m159	JACK	I'll lead them away.
L442127	u2476	m159	WILL	No.
L442121	u2470	m159	JACK	This way!
L442120	u2476	m159	WILL	Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
L442094	u2470	m159	JACK	On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
L442093	u2476	m159	WILL	On what?
L442092	u2470	m159	JACK	Depends.
L442091	u2476	m159	WILL	What's that?
L442082	u2476	m159	WILL	Barbossa.
L442081	u2470	m159	JACK	But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
L442080	u2470	m159	JACK	The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
L442079	u2476	m159	WILL	Wait -- what about the pistol?
L442054	u2470	m159	JACK	These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
L442053	u2476	m159	WILL	Shut up, before you lose them all!
L442012	u2470	m159	JACK	Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
L442011	u2476	m159	WILL	Just do it quickly.
L442009	u2470	m159	JACK	Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
L442008	u2476	m159	WILL	Tortuga?
L442005	u2470	m159	JACK	Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
L442004	u2476	m159	WILL	You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
L442003	u2470	m159	JACK	Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
L442002	u2476	m159	WILL	My father -- was not -- a pirate!
L442001	u2470	m159	JACK	Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
L442000	u2476	m159	WILL	My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
L441999	u2470	m159	JACK	You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
L441998	u2476	m159	WILL	He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
L441997	u2470	m159	JACK	Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
L441996	u2476	m159	WILL	It's not true my father was a pirate.
L441995	u2470	m159	JACK	I swear, you look just like him.
L441994	u2476	m159	WILL	That's not true.
L441993	u2470	m159	JACK	Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
L441992	u2476	m159	WILL	'Bootstrap?'
L441991	u2470	m159	JACK	I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
L441989	u2476	m159	WILL	My father.  William Turner?
L441988	u2470	m159	JACK	Is that so?
L441987	u2476	m159	WILL	I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
L441986	u2470	m159	JACK	For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
L441919	u2476	m159	WILL	Aye!  Avast!
L441918	u2470	m159	JACK	Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
L441917	u2470	m159	JACK	Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L441916	u2476	m159	WILL	This is either crazy, or brilliant.
L441915	u2470	m159	JACK	So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
L441914	u2476	m159	WILL	It's still against the law.
L441913	u2470	m159	JACK	Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
L441912	u2476	m159	WILL	We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
L441910	u2470	m159	JACK	No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
L441909	u2476	m159	WILL	I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
L441908	u2470	m159	JACK	Come aboard.
L441905	u2470	m159	JACK	Good.
L441904	u2476	m159	WILL	I'd die for her.
L441903	u2470	m159	JACK	My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
L441902	u2476	m159	WILL	Why are brothering with that?
L441901	u2476	m159	WILL	We need to go!
L441900	u2470	m159	JACK	Not without my effects.
L441898	u2470	m159	JACK	Agreed!
L441897	u2476	m159	WILL	Agreed.
L441893	u2476	m159	WILL	I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
L441892	u2470	m159	JACK	How?  The key's run off.
L441891	u2476	m159	WILL	I can get you out of here.
L441890	u2470	m159	JACK	So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
L441889	u2476	m159	WILL	Never.  They took Miss Swann.
L441888	u2470	m159	JACK	And you want to turn pirate yourself?
L441887	u2476	m159	WILL	Because you're a pirate.
L441886	u2470	m159	JACK	Why ask me?
L441885	u2476	m159	WILL	The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
L441884	u2470	m159	JACK	Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
L441883	u2476	m159	WILL	Where does it make berth?
L441882	u2470	m159	JACK	Somewhat.
L441881	u2476	m159	WILL	Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
L441783	u2476	m159	WILL	No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
L441782	u2470	m159	JACK	Move!
L441781	u2476	m159	WILL	No.
L441780	u2470	m159	JACK	Move away.
L441779	u2470	m159	JACK	Pirate.
L441778	u2476	m159	WILL	You cheated.
L441776	u2470	m159	JACK	You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
L441775	u2476	m159	WILL	I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
L441774	u2470	m159	JACK	Who makes all these?
L441769	u2470	m159	JACK	Only a little.
L441768	u2476	m159	WILL	You threatened Miss Swann.
L441767	u2470	m159	JACK	Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
L441766	u2470	m159	JACK	Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
L441765	u2476	m159	WILL	I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
L441764	u2470	m159	JACK	You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
L441874	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Still --
L441873	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Mentioned it, is more what he did.
L441872	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
L441706	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
L441705	u2471	m159	MULLROY	He may be.
L441704	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	He's not telling the truth.
L441703	u2471	m159	MULLROY	I think he's telling the truth.
L441700	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	And no lies!
L441699	u2471	m159	MULLROY	What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
L441693	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
L441692	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	... no.
L441691	u2471	m159	MULLROY	Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
L441690	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	But I've seen a ship with black sails.
L441689	u2471	m159	MULLROY	No.
L441688	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	... No.
L441687	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
L441686	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes, I have.
L441685	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You haven't seen it.
L441684	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
L441683	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen the Black Pearl?
L441682	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes.
L441681	u2471	m159	MULLROY	You've seen it?
L441680	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	Yes it is.  I've seen it.
L441679	u2471	m159	MULLROY	No, it's not.
L441678	u2472	m159	MURTOGG	The Black Pearl is a real ship.
L441677	u2471	m159	MULLROY	There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
L441938	u2475	m159	SWANN	Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
L441937	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Please.
L441936	u2475	m159	SWANN	But --
L441935	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	A moment.
L441934	u2475	m159	SWANN	Commodore --
L441796	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	Bleak.  Very bleak.
L441795	u2475	m159	SWANN	Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
L441794	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	No.  She hasn't.
L441793	u2475	m159	SWANN	Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
L441612	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
L441611	u2475	m159	SWANN	What happened here?
L441609	u2475	m159	SWANN	Where did he come from?
L441608	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	He's still breathing.
L441599	u2473	m159	NORRINGTON	My apologies, Governor.
L441598	u2475	m159	SWANN	Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
L447968	u2496	m162	BETTY	Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
L447967	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What?
L447966	u2496	m162	BETTY	Yes ...  It's just that ...
L447963	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Okay.
L447962	u2496	m162	BETTY	Yes.
L447961	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	You sure you want to know this?
L447959	u2496	m162	BETTY	Ah.
L447958	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	... Sex.
L447957	u2496	m162	BETTY	No. I want to know.
L447956	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	It doesn't matter.
L447955	u2496	m162	BETTY	What?
L447954	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Yeah ...  That--and ...
L447953	u2496	m162	BETTY	Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
L447952	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What do you mean?
L447951	u2496	m162	BETTY	What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
L447950	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Sure.
L447949	u2496	m162	BETTY	Can I ask you a question?
L447948	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Yeah?
L447947	u2496	m162	BETTY	Mary Sue?
L447659	u2496	m162	BETTY	Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
L447658	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
L447657	u2496	m162	BETTY	I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
L447652	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Thanks.
L447651	u2496	m162	BETTY	I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
L448542	u2496	m162	BETTY	I love you too.
L448541	u2502	m162	DAVID	Thanks ... I love you.
L448540	u2496	m162	BETTY	I'm so proud of you, Bud.
L448539	u2502	m162	DAVID	... It's a pretty short trip.
L448538	u2496	m162	BETTY	And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
L448537	u2502	m162	DAVID	I won't.
L448536	u2496	m162	BETTY	There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
L448535	u2496	m162	BETTY	I had to say goodbye.
L448534	u2502	m162	DAVID	Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
L448533	u2496	m162	BETTY	I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
L448090	u2502	m162	DAVID	Sure.
L448089	u2496	m162	BETTY	Thank you.
L448087	u2496	m162	BETTY	What?
L448086	u2502	m162	DAVID	Wait.
L448085	u2502	m162	DAVID	No ... They won't be able to tell.
L448084	u2496	m162	BETTY	And they won't be able to tell?
L448083	u2502	m162	DAVID	Looks just like it did.
L448082	u2496	m162	BETTY	Does it look okay?
L448079	u2496	m162	BETTY	In my handbag.
L448078	u2502	m162	DAVID	Have you got any make up?
L448076	u2496	m162	BETTY	I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
L448075	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's okay. It's alright.
L447848	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm fine.
L447847	u2496	m162	BETTY	How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
L447846	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh no ... I'm fine.
L447833	u2502	m162	DAVID	No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
L447832	u2496	m162	BETTY	Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
L447648	u2502	m162	DAVID	It can't be possible.
L447647	u2496	m162	BETTY	Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
L447621	u2502	m162	DAVID	We're in Pleasantville?
L447620	u2496	m162	BETTY	Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
L448286	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
L448285	u2496	m162	BETTY	Like a drum.
L448284	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Yeah. It does.
L448283	u2496	m162	BETTY	Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
L448282	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	But you can't go out there.
L448281	u2496	m162	BETTY	But I really should get home.
L448280	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	You can't go out there.
L448239	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	I don't know.
L448238	u2496	m162	BETTY	What is that?
L448197	u2496	m162	BETTY	No ...
L448196	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	It's alright. Let me see.
L448195	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	It's alright.
L448194	u2496	m162	BETTY	I've got to go ...
L448193	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Wait ...
L448192	u2496	m162	BETTY	Yes she is.
L448191	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	No she's not.
L448190	u2496	m162	BETTY	She's crying.
L448189	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	What?
L448188	u2496	m162	BETTY	She's crying.
L448187	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
L448185	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Here's my favorite.
L448184	u2496	m162	BETTY	Bud?
L448183	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Bud brought it to me.
L448182	u2496	m162	BETTY	Where'd you get this?
L448179	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
L448178	u2496	m162	BETTY	I think it looks nice.
L448177	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Having kind of a tough time.
L448175	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Thanks.
L448174	u2496	m162	BETTY	I just thought ... It's beautiful.
L448173	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	No, no ... Come on in.
L448172	u2496	m162	BETTY	I'm sorry ...
L448171	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh, hi ...
L447860	u2496	m162	BETTY	Hello Bill.
L447859	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh, hello Betty.
L448310	u2496	m162	BETTY	I'm gonna go now.
L448309	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Where are you gonna go?
L448308	u2496	m162	BETTY	I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
L448306	u2496	m162	BETTY	No I'm not sweetie.
L448305	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
L448304	u2496	m162	BETTY	I don't want it to go away.
L448303	u2504	m162	GEORGE	It goes away ... It'll go away.
L448302	u2496	m162	BETTY	I don't want to put on some make up ...
L448301	u2504	m162	GEORGE	It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
L448300	u2496	m162	BETTY	Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
L448299	u2496	m162	BETTY	No I'm not.
L448298	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Sure you are.
L448297	u2496	m162	BETTY	I told you, George. I'm not going.
L448296	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
L448295	u2504	m162	GEORGE	I was in a bowling-alley.
L448294	u2496	m162	BETTY	I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
L448293	u2504	m162	GEORGE	All night?
L448292	u2496	m162	BETTY	I told you where I was.
L447836	u2504	m162	GEORGE	But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
L447835	u2496	m162	BETTY	Oh, George ...
L447834	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
L447482	u2496	m162	BETTY	Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
L447481	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
L447480	u2496	m162	BETTY	How was your day?
L448386	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
L448385	u2497	m162	BIFF	It's better, Mary Sue.
L448384	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Don't! Just let go.
L448211	u2497	m162	BIFF	With what?
L448210	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I'm busy.
L448209	u2497	m162	BIFF	Why not?
L448208	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Oh.  I can't.
L448207	u2497	m162	BIFF	We were gonna ... You know ...
L448206	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	So.
L448205	u2497	m162	BIFF	It's six-thirty ...
L448204	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What are you doing?
L448203	u2497	m162	BIFF	Mary Sue--C'mon ...
L447843	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Trust me ...
L447842	u2497	m162	BIFF	It is?
L447841	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
L447839	u2497	m162	BIFF	I think ... I might be ill ...
L447838	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	... Why?
L447826	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	"Oh, Biff. You can ""pin"" me any time you want to."
L447825	u2497	m162	BIFF	To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
L447824	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
L447823	u2497	m162	BIFF	Sure is pretty.
L447817	u2497	m162	BIFF	Lover's Lane!
L447816	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	... Lover's Lane.
L447815	u2497	m162	BIFF	But where would we go?
L447814	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
L447813	u2497	m162	BIFF	What?
L447812	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	You want to get out of here?
L447811	u2497	m162	BIFF	Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
L447802	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
L447801	u2497	m162	BIFF	I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
L447800	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Oh, gosh no.
L447799	u2497	m162	BIFF	So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
L447798	u2497	m162	BIFF	Hunh?  Oh, right ...
L447797	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
L447796	u2497	m162	BIFF	"... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on ""Our Town Hall."" Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about."
L447790	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
L447789	u2497	m162	BIFF	Oh yeah.
L447788	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Really Biff? The keenest?
L447787	u2497	m162	BIFF	I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
L447786	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	"Well ""gee whizz"" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me."
L447785	u2497	m162	BIFF	I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
L447689	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Um ... It's ...
L447688	u2497	m162	BIFF	What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
L447900	u2497	m162	BIFF	Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
L447899	u2502	m162	DAVID	What'll it be?
L447728	u2497	m162	BIFF	I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
L447727	u2502	m162	DAVID	I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
L447726	u2497	m162	BIFF	She won't go out with me?
L447725	u2502	m162	DAVID	"What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little ""different"" lately ..."
L447724	u2502	m162	DAVID	Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
L447723	u2497	m162	BIFF	Yeah ... How'd you know?
L447722	u2502	m162	DAVID	You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
L447721	u2497	m162	BIFF	What's the matter?
L447720	u2502	m162	DAVID	I don't believe it.
L447719	u2497	m162	BIFF	What?
L447718	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh God! Are we in that episode?
L448509	u2498	m162	BIG BOB	No it couldn't!
L448508	u2502	m162	DAVID	But it could happen.
L448507	u2498	m162	BIG BOB	That's not going to happen!
L448506	u2502	m162	DAVID	C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
L448494	u2502	m162	DAVID	Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
L448493	u2498	m162	BIG BOB	Okay, that's IT!!!
L448492	u2502	m162	DAVID	"Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it ""love."""
L448267	u2504	m162	GEORGE	"Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said ""Honey. I'm home."""
L448266	u2499	m162	BOB	What happened?
L448263	u2499	m162	BOB	Real rain?
L448262	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Rain.
L448261	u2499	m162	BOB	Are you alright?  What is it?
L448067	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
L448066	u2499	m162	BOB	"Why don't you start by saying ""yes,"" and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs."
L448065	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
L448064	u2499	m162	BOB	And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
L448063	u2504	m162	GEORGE	No. Of course not.
L448062	u2499	m162	BOB	And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
L448061	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Thank you very much.
L448060	u2499	m162	BOB	No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
L448055	u2504	m162	GEORGE	... How?
L448054	u2499	m162	BOB	I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
L448053	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
L448052	u2504	m162	GEORGE	One of those ... big beds?
L448051	u2499	m162	BOB	Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
L448050	u2504	m162	GEORGE	No. What?
L448049	u2499	m162	BOB	Changes.  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
L448048	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Changes.
L448047	u2499	m162	BOB	"I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain ""changes"" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by ""changes""?"
L448045	u2499	m162	BOB	I'm fine--but thank you.
L448044	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
L448043	u2499	m162	BOB	Oh, no thanks ...
L448042	u2504	m162	GEORGE	Want some bridge mix?
L448504	u2499	m162	BOB	No it isn't.
L448503	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh sure it is.
L448502	u2499	m162	BOB	It's not in ME.
L448501	u2502	m162	DAVID	But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
L448500	u2499	m162	BOB	THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
L448499	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
L448498	u2499	m162	BOB	BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
L448497	u2502	m162	DAVID	Why am I out of order?
L448496	u2499	m162	BOB	YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
L448476	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
L448475	u2499	m162	BOB	You're not allowed to lie.
L448474	u2502	m162	DAVID	I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
L448473	u2499	m162	BOB	Okay--that's enough!
L448472	u2502	m162	DAVID	"See, I know you want it to stay ""Pleasant"" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ..."
L448470	u2502	m162	DAVID	Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
L448469	u2499	m162	BOB	The basketball team?
L448468	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's like the basketball team.
L448465	u2499	m162	BOB	Very well ...
L448464	u2502	m162	DAVID	I think I've got something to say.
L448461	u2499	m162	BOB	Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
L448460	u2502	m162	DAVID	It was accessible to everyone.
L448459	u2499	m162	BOB	Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
L448458	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well--it was dark out ...
L448457	u2499	m162	BOB	Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
L448456	u2499	m162	BOB	"We prefer to keep these proceedings as ""pleasant"" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary."
L448455	u2502	m162	DAVID	Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
L448454	u2499	m162	BOB	Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
L448423	u2502	m162	DAVID	Still doesn't make it right.
L448422	u2499	m162	BOB	You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
L448421	u2502	m162	DAVID	Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
L448420	u2499	m162	BOB	BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
L448419	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yes I do.
L448418	u2499	m162	BOB	Do you know that it's illegal?
L448417	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yes I did.
L448416	u2499	m162	BOB	Did you do this?
L448429	u2501	m162	DAN	Oh. guess I could do that, then.
L448428	u2499	m162	BOB	You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
L448427	u2501	m162	DAN	Well, I never had to do it before.
L448426	u2499	m162	BOB	What do you mean!?
L448425	u2501	m162	DAN	Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
L448424	u2499	m162	BOB	Dan! Arrest them!
L448025	u2502	m162	DAVID	I thought the books were blank?
L448024	u2500	m162	BOY	It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see.
L448015	u2500	m162	BOY	What is it?
L448014	u2502	m162	DAVID	Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
L448013	u2500	m162	BOY	What's outside of Pleasantville?
L448012	u2502	m162	DAVID	Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
L448011	u2500	m162	BOY	And where's that?
L448009	u2500	m162	BOY	How'd you know how to put it out and all?
L448008	u2502	m162	DAVID	What?
L448007	u2500	m162	BOY	How'd you know about the fire?
L448483	u2502	m162	DAVID	The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
L448482	u2510	m162	MR. SIMPSON	The other one?
L448481	u2502	m162	DAVID	No, not that hedge. The other one.
L448480	u2510	m162	MR. SIMPSON	Green.
L448479	u2502	m162	DAVID	What color is that hedge of yours?
L448478	u2510	m162	MR. SIMPSON	Yes.
L448477	u2502	m162	DAVID	Mr. Simpson ...
L447674	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
L447673	u2510	m162	MR. SIMPSON	Hear your Dad got a new car.
L447672	u2502	m162	DAVID	Hello Mr. Simpson.
L447671	u2510	m162	MR. SIMPSON	Hello Bud.
L448520	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
L448519	u2502	m162	DAVID	And you're sure about this?
L448518	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Right here.
L448517	u2502	m162	DAVID	You got the admissions letter.
L448516	u2502	m162	DAVID	Honestly ... no.
L448515	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
L448514	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
L448513	u2502	m162	DAVID	This thing works. We could go home right now.
L448512	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I told you. I'm like positive.
L448511	u2502	m162	DAVID	Are you sure?
L448161	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What?
L448160	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
L448159	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
L448158	u2502	m162	DAVID	What?
L448157	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	How come I'm still in black and white?
L448156	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yes.
L448155	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Can I ask you a question?
L448154	u2502	m162	DAVID	Wow.
L448153	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
L448152	u2502	m162	DAVID	You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
L448151	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	No. She really liked you.
L448150	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
L448149	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Yeah ...
L448148	u2502	m162	DAVID	Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
L448147	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Sure.
L448146	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
L448145	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	So what is it?
L448144	u2502	m162	DAVID	That's great.
L448143	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
L448142	u2502	m162	DAVID	... Yeah.
L448141	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
L448140	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
L448139	u2502	m162	DAVID	You're reading?
L448137	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Nothing?
L448136	u2502	m162	DAVID	Nothing.
L448135	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What's wrong?
L448029	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
L448028	u2502	m162	DAVID	The pages filled in?
L448027	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
L448004	u2502	m162	DAVID	Sure.
L448003	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
L448002	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's fine.
L448001	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Not directly anyhow ...
L448000	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's okay.
L447999	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I had nothing to do with that fire.
L447902	u2502	m162	DAVID	Really? It seems so fattening.
L447901	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Me too. Sounds swell.
L447891	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
L447890	u2502	m162	DAVID	They don't have that kind of potential.
L447889	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	"David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be ""attractive."" They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better."
L447888	u2502	m162	DAVID	I just don't think we have the right to ...
L447887	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
L447886	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
L447885	u2502	m162	DAVID	They're happy like this.
L447884	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Well if I don't who will?
L447883	u2502	m162	DAVID	You have no right to do this.
L447879	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
L447878	u2502	m162	DAVID	You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
L447877	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
L447876	u2502	m162	DAVID	You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
L447867	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Nothing.
L447866	u2502	m162	DAVID	What did you do to him?
L447810	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	"Gee whiz ""Bud"", what could we possibly need when we have each other?"
L447809	u2502	m162	DAVID	Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
L447759	u2502	m162	DAVID	Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
L447758	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
L447757	u2502	m162	DAVID	Jen please ...
L447756	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	So what's the point?
L447755	u2502	m162	DAVID	They don't notice that kind of thing.
L447754	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What do you mean?
L447753	u2502	m162	DAVID	He won't notice anyway.
L447752	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
L447751	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's in your closet.
L447750	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I could like kill a guy with these things.
L447742	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
L447741	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I like--really need a cigarette, too.
L447740	u2502	m162	DAVID	Jen, listen ...
L447739	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
L447738	u2502	m162	DAVID	JENNIFER!
L447737	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
L447736	u2502	m162	DAVID	What were you doing in a library?
L447735	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
L447734	u2502	m162	DAVID	What?
L447733	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
L447732	u2502	m162	DAVID	One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
L447731	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	No way.
L447699	u2502	m162	DAVID	I don't think so.
L447698	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Can we do any better?
L447697	u2502	m162	DAVID	Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
L447696	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Those are my friends.
L447695	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Hunh.
L447694	u2502	m162	DAVID	As a matter of fact he does.
L447693	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	"Does he--you know--like ""me""?"
L447692	u2502	m162	DAVID	Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
L447691	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Who's that?
L447684	u2502	m162	DAVID	To who?
L447683	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
L447682	u2502	m162	DAVID	We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
L447681	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
L447680	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
L447679	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Play along?
L447678	u2502	m162	DAVID	We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
L447677	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
L447676	u2502	m162	DAVID	Owns the hardware store.
L447675	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	You know him?
L447670	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
L447669	u2502	m162	DAVID	We're supposed to be in school.
L447668	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I still don't see why we're doing this.
L447667	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
L447666	u2502	m162	DAVID	Just take deep breaths.
L447665	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
L447655	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Neither do I.
L447654	u2502	m162	DAVID	I don't believe this.
L447646	u2502	m162	DAVID	I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
L447645	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What's going to happen?
L447644	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh God.
L447627	u2502	m162	DAVID	You--you gotta get us out of here.
L447626	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Noooooo!
L447612	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
L447611	u2502	m162	DAVID	I don't know.
L447610	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What did you do?
L447608	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm not sure.
L447607	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What happened?
L447606	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh my God.
L447605	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	YOU get lost!
L447604	u2502	m162	DAVID	Get lost!
L447603	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	God, David. Just give it to me!
L447600	u2502	m162	DAVID	Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
L447599	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
L447596	u2502	m162	DAVID	No way.
L447595	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Lemme see that.
L447551	u2502	m162	DAVID	No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
L447550	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
L447549	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
L447548	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
L447547	u2502	m162	DAVID	Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
L447546	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
L447545	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah. Every episode ever.
L447544	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Pleasantville Marathon?
L447543	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
L447542	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
L447541	u2502	m162	DAVID	What are you doing?
L447540	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What are you doing?
L448526	u2502	m162	DAVID	I like it too.
L448525	u2507	m162	MARGARET	I like calling you David.
L448524	u2502	m162	DAVID	No I won't. I swear.
L448523	u2507	m162	MARGARET	You're gonna forget about me.
L448382	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm not sure.
L448381	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Where are they?
L448320	u2502	m162	DAVID	Sure ...
L448319	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Can I open it?
L448318	u2502	m162	DAVID	It was a prop for the school play ...
L448317	u2507	m162	MARGARET	It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
L448247	u2502	m162	DAVID	We'll just put up the top.
L448246	u2507	m162	MARGARET	What do we do?
L448244	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
L448243	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Real rain?
L448242	u2502	m162	DAVID	Rain.
L448241	u2507	m162	MARGARET	What's going on?
L448233	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
L448232	u2502	m162	DAVID	They just grow like that?
L448231	u2507	m162	MARGARET	I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
L448230	u2502	m162	DAVID	Hunh?
L448229	u2507	m162	MARGARET	You want some berries?
L448228	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
L448227	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
L448226	u2507	m162	MARGARET	What's that like?
L448225	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah.
L448224	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
L448223	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
L448222	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
L448221	u2507	m162	MARGARET	How?
L448219	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Out there.
L448218	u2502	m162	DAVID	What?
L448217	u2507	m162	MARGARET	So what's it like?
L448216	u2507	m162	MARGARET	You don't know?
L448215	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
L448214	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Do they have those ... Where you come from?
L448213	u2502	m162	DAVID	Mmmmgh.
L448164	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh ... Right.
L448163	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
L448112	u2502	m162	DAVID	... Lover's Lane?
L448111	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Sure ... Where would we go?
L448109	u2502	m162	DAVID	Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
L448108	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Oh ... Hi.
L448107	u2502	m162	DAVID	Hi.
L448021	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
L448020	u2507	m162	MARGARET	Keeps going ...
L447996	u2507	m162	MARGARET	No. I baked them for you.
L447995	u2502	m162	DAVID	No. You baked them for Whitey.
L447994	u2507	m162	MARGARET	No. I baked them for you.
L447993	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
L447992	u2507	m162	MARGARET	I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
L447991	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
L447990	u2507	m162	MARGARET	That was sure swell ...
L447515	u2502	m162	DAVID	Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
L447514	u2505	m162	HOWARD	A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
L447513	u2502	m162	DAVID	Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
L447512	u2505	m162	HOWARD	You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
L447509	u2502	m162	DAVID	Marmalade.
L447508	u2505	m162	HOWARD	Scout?
L447507	u2502	m162	DAVID	Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
L447506	u2502	m162	DAVID	Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
L447505	u2505	m162	HOWARD	Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
L448453	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
L448452	u2502	m162	DAVID	There's worse places.
L448451	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
L448450	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm going on trial tomorrow?
L448449	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
L448447	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
L448446	u2502	m162	DAVID	I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
L448445	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	How long do you think you've been here?
L448444	u2502	m162	DAVID	They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
L448443	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
L448442	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm sorry. I can't do that.
L448441	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Just gimme the damn remote!
L448440	u2502	m162	DAVID	So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
L448439	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
L448438	u2502	m162	DAVID	Why don't you just take me back without it?
L448437	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Because you're coming home.
L448436	u2502	m162	DAVID	Why?
L448435	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
L448434	u2502	m162	DAVID	I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
L448433	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Hope you're proud of yourself.
L448368	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
L448367	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm going to leave now.
L448366	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	OW!
L448365	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
L448364	u2502	m162	DAVID	I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
L448363	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	EXCUSE ME?
L448362	u2502	m162	DAVID	No you're not.
L448361	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
L448360	u2502	m162	DAVID	Why?
L448359	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Where's the remote control I gave you?
L448356	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Oh no? Let me show you something!
L448355	u2502	m162	DAVID	I didn't do anything wrong.
L448354	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
L448353	u2502	m162	DAVID	... Only if they mean it.
L448352	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
L448351	u2502	m162	DAVID	Look ...
L448350	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
L448349	u2502	m162	DAVID	I had nothing to do with that.
L448348	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	"A deluge doesn't just ""happen."" Bolts of lightning don't just ""happen"" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ..."
L448347	u2502	m162	DAVID	"Look--it just sort of ""happened"" ..."
L448346	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
L448345	u2502	m162	DAVID	What do you mean?
L448343	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	NOW!
L448342	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh--well ...
L448341	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	I want a word with you ...
L448134	u2502	m162	DAVID	Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
L448133	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	BUD.
L448132	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
L448131	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Excuse me?
L448130	u2502	m162	DAVID	"Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just ""cookies"" after all ..."
L448129	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
L448128	u2502	m162	DAVID	Re-runs?
L448127	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
L448126	u2502	m162	DAVID	"Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my ""dad"" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ..."
L448125	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
L448124	u2502	m162	DAVID	Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
L448123	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	What?
L448122	u2502	m162	DAVID	I can't.
L448121	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
L448119	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Well c'mere, young fella.
L448118	u2502	m162	DAVID	... Hi.
L448117	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Hello there.
L447643	u2502	m162	DAVID	COME BACK!!!
L447642	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
L447641	u2502	m162	DAVID	WAIT A MINUTE!!
L447640	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
L447639	u2502	m162	DAVID	Where are you going ...
L447638	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
L447637	u2502	m162	DAVID	Don't get upset.
L447635	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
L447634	u2502	m162	DAVID	Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
L447631	u2502	m162	DAVID	My name's David.
L447630	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	"Oh sure you do ... ""McIntire's Department store"" ... ""Their father dressed as Prince Charming."" That was gorgeous Bud."
L447629	u2502	m162	DAVID	Because we don't belong!
L447628	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Why would I do that?
L447619	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
L447618	u2502	m162	DAVID	What the hell's going on!
L447617	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
L447588	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
L447587	u2502	m162	DAVID	How much does it cost?
L447585	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
L447584	u2502	m162	DAVID	Ooomph?
L447583	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	"Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more ""Ooomph"" in it."
L447582	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	That's right.
L447581	u2502	m162	DAVID	"No. McIntire's. Remember:  ""For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."""
L447580	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	McGinty's.
L447579	u2502	m162	DAVID	McIntire's.
L447578	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	What department store did they go to?
L447577	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah ...
L447574	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Nice ... Nice ...
L447573	u2502	m162	DAVID	... Like Prince Charming.
L447572	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Right. And how did she dress him?
L447571	u2502	m162	DAVID	... Her father.
L447563	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
L447562	u2502	m162	DAVID	You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
L447561	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
L447560	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	We'll get you fixed up in no time.
L447559	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah ... Sort of ...
L447558	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
L448532	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Just a little--You know.
L448531	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's beautiful.
L448528	u2502	m162	DAVID	You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
L448527	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
L448413	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
L448412	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
L448104	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	No, that's not it.
L448103	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
L448102	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	I'll never be able to do that.
L448101	u2502	m162	DAVID	What's wrong?
L448097	u2502	m162	DAVID	Open it.
L448096	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
L448095	u2502	m162	DAVID	It's an art book.
L448094	u2502	m162	DAVID	I brought you something ... From the library.
L448093	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Aren't you a little early?
L448092	u2502	m162	DAVID	Hi.
L448091	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh, hi.
L447929	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
L447928	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah.
L447927	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Really?
L447926	u2502	m162	DAVID	I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
L447925	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Well don't you?
L447924	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	"Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought ""Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"""
L447923	u2502	m162	DAVID	Wow ... That's pretty good ...
L447921	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Christmastime.
L447920	u2502	m162	DAVID	... What's that?
L447919	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	You know what I really like?
L447918	u2502	m162	DAVID	So they can have their hamburgers!
L447917	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Why?
L447916	u2502	m162	DAVID	Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
L447915	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
L447914	u2502	m162	DAVID	Forget about that!
L447913	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
L447912	u2502	m162	DAVID	Just listen to me ...
L447911	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
L447910	u2502	m162	DAVID	What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
L447909	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
L447906	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh--what's the point, Bud?
L447905	u2502	m162	DAVID	Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
L447904	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	There aren't any cheeseburgers.
L447903	u2502	m162	DAVID	Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
L447857	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
L447856	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah ...
L447855	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
L447854	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah ...
L447853	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Bud ...
L447852	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
L447851	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
L447850	u2502	m162	DAVID	Oh hi!
L447783	u2502	m162	DAVID	Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
L447782	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Yes.
L447781	u2502	m162	DAVID	Have you cooked the burgers?
L447780	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	... Yeah.
L447779	u2502	m162	DAVID	Do you have the lettuce?
L447778	u2502	m162	DAVID	Listen to me!
L447777	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
L447776	u2502	m162	DAVID	What?
L447775	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	There aren't any cheeseburgers.
L447771	u2502	m162	DAVID	I understand.
L447770	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	I'm so glad you're here.
L447769	u2502	m162	DAVID	You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
L447767	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
L447766	u2502	m162	DAVID	Yeah ...
L447765	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
L447764	u2502	m162	DAVID	What's wrong?
L447762	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Oh.
L447761	u2502	m162	DAVID	Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
L447760	u2509	m162	MR. JOHNSON	Bud?
L447633	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
L447632	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Oh GOD ...
L447624	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
L447623	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
L447622	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Dream come true, hunh?
L447616	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	A miracle.
L447615	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	What happened?
L447614	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
L447590	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
L447589	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Free?
L447576	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
L447575	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
L447570	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
L447569	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
L447568	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
L447565	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	What's the rush?
L447564	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
L447557	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Well here I am.
L447556	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Yeah ...
L447555	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	Yeah. TV busted?
L447554	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	TV repair?
L447553	u2503	m162	DICK VAN DYKE	TV repair.
L447533	u2508	m162	MARK	Cool.
L447532	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Cool.
L447531	u2508	m162	MARK	So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
L447529	u2508	m162	MARK	Yeah. 
L447528	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
L447527	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Yeah ... Saw you too.
L447526	u2508	m162	MARK	Saw you at the mall yesterday.
L447523	u2506	m162	JENNIFER	Hey.
L447522	u2508	m162	MARK	Hey.
L530025	u2871	m189	LIZ	Let me see.
L530024	u2863	m189	ADELE	Peter-- you took this picture?
L530017	u2871	m189	LIZ	Be nice.
L530016	u2863	m189	ADELE	And Flash isn't?
L530011	u2863	m189	ADELE	At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
L530010	u2871	m189	LIZ	Well, look who's dressing for success.
L529867	u2871	m189	LIZ	Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
L529866	u2863	m189	ADELE	Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
L529862	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
L529861	u2863	m189	ADELE	Sexual tension...
L529663	u2864	m189	BEN	I'm always here, Pete.
L529662	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.
L529661	u2864	m189	BEN	When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
L529659	u2864	m189	BEN	-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
L529658	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
L529657	u2864	m189	BEN	Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
L529656	u2876	m189	PETER	No, no.
L529655	u2864	m189	BEN	Cause if you get in a bind--
L529654	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, sure.
L529653	u2864	m189	BEN	Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
L529652	u2864	m189	BEN	Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
L529651	u2876	m189	PETER	Remember Little League?
L529650	u2864	m189	BEN	S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
L529649	u2876	m189	PETER	No?not really.
L529648	u2864	m189	BEN	Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
L529647	u2864	m189	BEN	Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
L529646	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
L529645	u2864	m189	BEN	Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
L529644	u2876	m189	PETER	You stop him?
L529643	u2864	m189	BEN	Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
L529642	u2876	m189	PETER	Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
L529641	u2864	m189	BEN	So, uh... how's college goin'?
L529640	u2876	m189	PETER	No. No, that's okay.
L529639	u2864	m189	BEN	What, want a glass?
L529638	u2876	m189	PETER	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
L529637	u2864	m189	BEN	Here you go, Pete.
L530253	u2866	m189	HARRY	Or was it all a dream?
L530252	u2865	m189	FLASH	See?
L530251	u2866	m189	HARRY	I was there.
L530021	u2865	m189	FLASH	-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
L530020	u2866	m189	HARRY	Flash, drop it--
L530019	u2865	m189	FLASH	No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
L530018	u2866	m189	HARRY	Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
L530194	u2865	m189	FLASH	Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
L530193	u2871	m189	LIZ	Flash, get lost.
L530029	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hm.  What a lump.
L530028	u2865	m189	FLASH	Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
L530015	u2871	m189	LIZ	I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
L530014	u2865	m189	FLASH	Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
L529590	u2865	m189	FLASH	I'm parked illegally!
L529589	u2871	m189	LIZ	I was sort of hoping to get out of--
L529588	u2865	m189	FLASH	Lizzy!
L530256	u2866	m189	HARRY	Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
L530255	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
L530254	u2866	m189	HARRY	Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
L530188	u2866	m189	HARRY	I got you a present.
L530187	u2876	m189	PETER	Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
L530186	u2866	m189	HARRY	You get mugged or something?
L530009	u2876	m189	PETER	You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
L530008	u2866	m189	HARRY	And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
L530007	u2876	m189	PETER	Mm-hmm.
L530006	u2866	m189	HARRY	Jesus Christ.
L529813	u2866	m189	HARRY	I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the bermensch!
L529812	u2876	m189	PETER	Don't be pitiful.
L529811	u2866	m189	HARRY	You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
L529810	u2866	m189	HARRY	Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
L529809	u2876	m189	PETER	Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
L529808	u2866	m189	HARRY	Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
L529807	u2876	m189	PETER	I know.  I've got one too.
L529806	u2866	m189	HARRY	Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times.
L529805	u2876	m189	PETER	Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
L529804	u2866	m189	HARRY	Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University.
L529803	u2876	m189	PETER	Harry?
L529802	u2866	m189	HARRY	Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
L529561	u2876	m189	PETER	Harry!
L529560	u2866	m189	HARRY	A little bunny I saved from dissection.
L529559	u2876	m189	PETER	What's in there?
L529558	u2866	m189	HARRY	They'll never take me alive.
L529557	u2876	m189	PETER	You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
L529755	u2876	m189	PETER	Right.
L529754	u2867	m189	HOGAN	You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
L529753	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
L529752	u2867	m189	HOGAN	How are you doing, kid?
L529748	u2867	m189	HOGAN	Get away from me, freak!
L529747	u2876	m189	PETER	Are you okay?
L529746	u2876	m189	PETER	That's not even close.
L529745	u2867	m189	HOGAN	Lemme down, bugface!
L529744	u2876	m189	PETER	Now tell me you love me.
L529836	u2868	m189	JAMESON	No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
L529835	u2876	m189	PETER	Can I get a word in edgewise?
L529834	u2868	m189	JAMESON	No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
L529833	u2876	m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
L529832	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
L529831	u2876	m189	PETER	You print pictures of Bigfoot!
L529830	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
L529829	u2876	m189	PETER	Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
L529828	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
L529827	u2876	m189	PETER	Mr. Jameson--
L529826	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
L529825	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
L529824	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
L529712	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
L529711	u2876	m189	PETER	Can't focus...
L529699	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
L529698	u2876	m189	PETER	Can we make it a hundred?
L529697	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
L529696	u2876	m189	PETER	Yeah--
L529695	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
L529694	u2876	m189	PETER	You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
L529599	u2868	m189	JAMESON	You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
L529598	u2876	m189	PETER	Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
L529595	u2876	m189	PETER	I think you're trying to tell me something.
L529594	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
L530125	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Hmf-hrr?
L530124	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
L530122	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Fine.
L530121	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Frmpph-yrr.
L530120	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
L530119	u2868	m189	JAMESON	Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
L530118	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Would you cool it already?
L530117	u2868	m189	JAMESON	I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
L530116	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
L529766	u2876	m189	PETER	Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
L529765	u2869	m189	LEIBER	An even five I throw in the jacket.
L529764	u2876	m189	PETER	Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
L529763	u2869	m189	LEIBER	You're making my life difficult.
L529762	u2876	m189	PETER	How about tomorrow?
L529761	u2869	m189	LEIBER	Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
L529760	u2876	m189	PETER	A spider.  Eight legs.
L529759	u2869	m189	LEIBER	What's this? A cockaroach?
L529758	u2876	m189	PETER	Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
L529757	u2869	m189	LEIBER	No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
L529991	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
L529990	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Are you quite finished?
L529922	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
L529921	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
L529916	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Well...
L529915	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
L529914	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Thanks, I already ate.
L529913	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
L529912	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Just call me Spidey.
L529911	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
L529910	u2879	m189	SPIDER-MAN	Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
L529909	u2870	m189	LETTERMAN	Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
L530139	u2873	m189	MAY	What if the world ends tomorrow?
L530138	u2871	m189	LIZ	What if you get hurt?
L530137	u2873	m189	MAY	Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
L530136	u2871	m189	LIZ	Even if they're not clever.
L530135	u2873	m189	MAY	Some things you should say anyway.
L530134	u2871	m189	LIZ	He knew.
L530133	u2873	m189	MAY	Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
L530128	u2871	m189	LIZ	I don't think he wants me to find him.
L530127	u2873	m189	MAY	When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
L530126	u2871	m189	LIZ	He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
L530269	u2876	m189	PETER	Nah.
L530268	u2871	m189	LIZ	This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
L530267	u2871	m189	LIZ	Why?
L530266	u2876	m189	PETER	Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
L530265	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
L530264	u2876	m189	PETER	I... I like you.  A lot.
L530263	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
L530262	u2876	m189	PETER	Hello, Liz.
L530203	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm here...
L530202	u2871	m189	LIZ	Peter?
L530201	u2871	m189	LIZ	Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is? what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
L530200	u2876	m189	PETER	Strong...
L530199	u2871	m189	LIZ	Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
L530198	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, God, I forgot to--
L530197	u2871	m189	LIZ	May's much better. She'll be out soon.
L530196	u2871	m189	LIZ	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
L530195	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
L530090	u2876	m189	PETER	Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
L530089	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
L530087	u2871	m189	LIZ	I know what you mean.  I...
L530086	u2876	m189	PETER	Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
L530085	u2871	m189	LIZ	Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
L530084	u2876	m189	PETER	You'd feel what?
L530083	u2871	m189	LIZ	"So?  The next day I'd read, ""Peter Parker murdered,"" and I'd feel..."
L530082	u2876	m189	PETER	Well, no.
L530081	u2871	m189	LIZ	You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
L530080	u2876	m189	PETER	They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
L530079	u2876	m189	PETER	I think I'd like that.
L530078	u2871	m189	LIZ	Do you mind if I come too?
L530077	u2876	m189	PETER	-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
L530073	u2876	m189	PETER	That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
L530072	u2871	m189	LIZ	This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
L530071	u2876	m189	PETER	No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
L530070	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh, don't do it on my account--
L530069	u2876	m189	PETER	Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
L530068	u2871	m189	LIZ	What's in the bag?  Garbage?
L529870	u2871	m189	LIZ	That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
L529869	u2876	m189	PETER	This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
L529868	u2871	m189	LIZ	Sit down and stop being such a child.
L529865	u2876	m189	PETER	I've got no problems.
L529864	u2871	m189	LIZ	What's your problem?
L529863	u2876	m189	PETER	Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
L529860	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm sure you kept warm.
L529859	u2871	m189	LIZ	Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
L529858	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi, Adele.
L529857	u2871	m189	LIZ	Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
L529587	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh. Maybe I should, too--
L529586	u2876	m189	PETER	I've gotta study.
L529585	u2871	m189	LIZ	What are you doing this weekend?
L529584	u2871	m189	LIZ	Hurry up, Flash!
L529583	u2876	m189	PETER	I'd never admit that.
L529582	u2871	m189	LIZ	"Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like ""Flash."""
L529581	u2876	m189	PETER	Does it have a human name?
L529580	u2871	m189	LIZ	Some prep school thing.
L529579	u2876	m189	PETER	"Flash, Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself ""Flash."""
L529578	u2871	m189	LIZ	You should write that one down.
L529577	u2876	m189	PETER	But you like that in a man?
L529576	u2871	m189	LIZ	God, Flash can be such a jerk.
L529575	u2876	m189	PETER	What?
L529574	u2871	m189	LIZ	You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
L529573	u2876	m189	PETER	I suppose.
L529572	u2871	m189	LIZ	Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
L529571	u2876	m189	PETER	My my.
L529570	u2871	m189	LIZ	Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
L529569	u2876	m189	PETER	Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
L529568	u2871	m189	LIZ	He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
L529567	u2876	m189	PETER	Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
L529566	u2871	m189	LIZ	Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
L529565	u2876	m189	PETER	-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
L529548	u2876	m189	PETER	Thank God.
L529547	u2871	m189	LIZ	No.  I was lying about the coffee.
L529544	u2871	m189	LIZ	I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
L529543	u2876	m189	PETER	I hate--
L529542	u2871	m189	LIZ	I hate people with alliterative names.
L529541	u2876	m189	PETER	I hate the Platonic idea of you.
L529540	u2871	m189	LIZ	Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
L529539	u2876	m189	PETER	I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
L529538	u2871	m189	LIZ	Uh is a good start.
L529537	u2876	m189	PETER	I-- uh--
L529536	u2871	m189	LIZ	"Fill in the blank: ""I blank Elizabeth Allan."""
L529535	u2876	m189	PETER	Huh?
L529534	u2871	m189	LIZ	It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
L529533	u2876	m189	PETER	It's too early to be clever.
L529532	u2871	m189	LIZ	How very dull, Peter Parker.
L529531	u2876	m189	PETER	Good morning, Liz.
L530211	u2878	m189	ROZ	Precise equipment? such as waldos?
L530210	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
L530208	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
L530207	u2878	m189	ROZ	Any sign of our friend?
L530206	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Yeah, Roz.
L530052	u2878	m189	ROZ	Peter-- my condolences.
L530051	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
L530050	u2878	m189	ROZ	"No such thing as coincidence.  ""God does not play dice with the universe."""
L530049	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
L530048	u2878	m189	ROZ	Of course.
L530046	u2878	m189	ROZ	I know him.
L530045	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	You sure about all this?
L530044	u2878	m189	ROZ	And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
L530043	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Toxic dumps, huh.
L530042	u2878	m189	ROZ	There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
L530041	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
L530040	u2878	m189	ROZ	Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
L530039	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
L530038	u2878	m189	ROZ	Waldos.
L530037	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
L530036	u2878	m189	ROZ	Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
L530035	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	Some of him? char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
L530034	u2878	m189	ROZ	So you've found Thorkel?
L530033	u2872	m189	MAROTTA	You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
L529980	u2873	m189	MAY	He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
L529979	u2876	m189	PETER	How is he?
L529978	u2873	m189	MAY	I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
L529977	u2876	m189	PETER	Aunt May, what happened?
L529976	u2873	m189	MAY	Oh, Ben gets through everything.
L529975	u2876	m189	PETER	It's fine.  Tell me what--
L529974	u2873	m189	MAY	Peter, you're bleeding.
L529675	u2873	m189	MAY	See?  You big dullard.
L529674	u2876	m189	PETER	A match made in heaven.
L529671	u2873	m189	MAY	Use a fork.
L529670	u2876	m189	PETER	Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
L529669	u2873	m189	MAY	Absolutely no class.
L529668	u2873	m189	MAY	You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
L529667	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
L529665	u2873	m189	MAY	Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
L529664	u2876	m189	PETER	What the hell is that?
L529620	u2873	m189	MAY	It'll shut itself off.
L529619	u2876	m189	PETER	The record--
L529618	u2876	m189	PETER	No.
L529617	u2873	m189	MAY	Yes.  Do you have a date?
L529616	u2876	m189	PETER	It's Friday night...
L529615	u2873	m189	MAY	Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
L529614	u2876	m189	PETER	I'm a photographer, remember?
L529613	u2873	m189	MAY	Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
L529612	u2876	m189	PETER	I'll introduce you.
L529611	u2873	m189	MAY	--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
L529610	u2876	m189	PETER	I am old enough to--
L529608	u2873	m189	MAY	Oh, Peter. A zit.
L529607	u2876	m189	PETER	When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
L529606	u2873	m189	MAY	Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
L529605	u2876	m189	PETER	Aunt May, you're trespassing.
L529604	u2873	m189	MAY	That's the understatement of the year.
L529603	u2876	m189	PETER	There's nothing in there worth stealing!
L529719	u2876	m189	PETER	Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
L529718	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
L529717	u2876	m189	PETER	I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
L529716	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Is this some sort of Zen thing?
L529715	u2876	m189	PETER	Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
L529714	u2874	m189	NURSE VOICE	Poison emergency.
L529797	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
L529796	u2875	m189	OCK	I will finish what I've begun?
L529795	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering? the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron?
L529636	u2875	m189	OCK	No!
L529635	u2880	m189	THORKEL	That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
L529632	u2875	m189	OCK	I don't care.  Cretin.
L529631	u2880	m189	THORKEL	You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
L529630	u2875	m189	OCK	This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
L529629	u2880	m189	THORKEL	What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
L529628	u2875	m189	OCK	I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
L529627	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
L529626	u2880	m189	THORKEL	I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
L529625	u2875	m189	OCK	In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
L529624	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Let's talk in the hall.
L529623	u2875	m189	OCK	Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
L529622	u2880	m189	THORKEL	Power down.  I need to talk to you.
L529621	u2875	m189	OCK	Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
L530218	u2878	m189	ROZ	You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
L530217	u2875	m189	OCK	Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
L530216	u2878	m189	ROZ	My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
L529791	u2875	m189	OCK	Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
L529790	u2878	m189	ROZ	Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
L529789	u2878	m189	ROZ	No. It isn't.
L529788	u2875	m189	OCK	I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
L529787	u2878	m189	ROZ	Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
L529786	u2875	m189	OCK	Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
L529785	u2878	m189	ROZ	Creation? Or its opposite?
L529784	u2875	m189	OCK	You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
L529783	u2878	m189	ROZ	All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
L529782	u2875	m189	OCK	My? self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
L529780	u2875	m189	OCK	Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
L529779	u2878	m189	ROZ	A bit melodramatic? but if you could prove it? that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
L529682	u2875	m189	OCK	I left a paper in my desk.
L529681	u2878	m189	ROZ	I heard about Thorkel's order--
L529680	u2875	m189	OCK	No.  No thank you.  I have work.
L529529	u2878	m189	ROZ	Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
L529528	u2875	m189	OCK	Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
L529527	u2878	m189	ROZ	Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
L530260	u2878	m189	ROZ	If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
L530259	u2876	m189	PETER	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
L530258	u2878	m189	ROZ	The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
L530058	u2876	m189	PETER	I'll try. Thanks.
L530057	u2878	m189	ROZ	You never know.  Go get some sleep.
L530056	u2876	m189	PETER	I don't think I'll be running into him.
L530055	u2878	m189	ROZ	Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
L530054	u2876	m189	PETER	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
L530053	u2878	m189	ROZ	"This photo you took of ""Spider-Man"" -"
L529889	u2878	m189	ROZ	No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
L529888	u2876	m189	PETER	Need any more help?

But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?

L550935	u3062	m200	TRAN	Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.

L551424	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
L551423	u3059	m200	MAX	You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.

L551384	u3055	m200	FAITH	Jesus.
L551383	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
L551382	u3055	m200	FAITH	You can't just... kill him.
L551381	u3055	m200	FAITH	What're you going to do?
L551380	u3059	m200	MAX	Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
L551379	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
L551378	u3059	m200	MAX	This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
L551300	u3055	m200	FAITH	What a nightmare.
L551299	u3057	m200	LENNY	The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
L551298	u3055	m200	FAITH	You think Tran killed her?
L551297	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
L551296	u3055	m200	FAITH	So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
L551286	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Mace is in this.
L551285	u3055	m200	FAITH	We should talk alone.
L551284	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
L551283	u3055	m200	FAITH	Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
L551282	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
L551281	u3055	m200	FAITH	What's going on?
L551048	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tell me.
L551047	u3055	m200	FAITH	You don't know what you're fucking with here.
L551046	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
L551045	u3055	m200	FAITH	Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
L551044	u3057	m200	LENNY	Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
L551043	u3055	m200	FAITH	Who did it?
L551042	u3057	m200	LENNY	Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
L551041	u3055	m200	FAITH	You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
L550969	u3055	m200	FAITH	"You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say ""The End."" You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes."
L550968	u3057	m200	LENNY	Can't do it.
L550967	u3055	m200	FAITH	Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
L550966	u3057	m200	LENNY	Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
L550965	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
L550964	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
L550963	u3055	m200	FAITH	Damn right.
L550962	u3057	m200	LENNY	Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
L550961	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
L550960	u3055	m200	FAITH	Maybe.
L550959	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?  He gonna record you on his label?
L550958	u3055	m200	FAITH	He has his uses too.
L550957	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
L550956	u3055	m200	FAITH	That's a good one, coming from you.
L550955	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
L550954	u3055	m200	FAITH	Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
L550953	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
L550952	u3055	m200	FAITH	Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
L550951	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tonight.
L550950	u3055	m200	FAITH	You talked to Iris?  When?
L550949	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
L550948	u3055	m200	FAITH	You have to go.  I mean it.
L550947	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'm already hurting.
L550946	u3055	m200	FAITH	I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
L550945	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
L550933	u3055	m200	FAITH	No, Lenny.
L550932	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, call me, okay?
L550926	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just got to talk to you for one second.
L550925	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
L550920	u3057	m200	LENNY	Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
L550919	u3055	m200	FAITH	Cut it out, Tran.
L550881	u3055	m200	FAITH	Make me forget it, baby.
L550880	u3057	m200	LENNY	Forget it's there.
L550879	u3055	m200	FAITH	I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
L550878	u3057	m200	LENNY	I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
L550877	u3055	m200	FAITH	I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
L550736	u3057	m200	LENNY	Watch and see.
L550735	u3055	m200	FAITH	Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
L550773	u3057	m200	LENNY	You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
L550772	u3056	m200	KEITH	Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
L550769	u3057	m200	LENNY	Step into my office.
L550768	u3056	m200	KEITH	What?  Right Here?
L550767	u3057	m200	LENNY	Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
L550766	u3056	m200	KEITH	Talk to me about costs, here.
L550765	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
L550764	u3056	m200	KEITH	Sounds good.
L550761	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
L550760	u3056	m200	KEITH	What kind of things exactly?
L550759	u3057	m200	LENNY	That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
L550758	u3056	m200	KEITH	Clips.
L550757	u3057	m200	LENNY	I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
L550756	u3056	m200	KEITH	Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
L550755	u3057	m200	LENNY	A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
L550754	u3056	m200	KEITH	No.
L550750	u3056	m200	KEITH	That's right.
L550749	u3057	m200	LENNY	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
L550748	u3056	m200	KEITH	I understand.  No, I'm not.
L551421	u3059	m200	MAX	This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
L551420	u3057	m200	LENNY	How did you hook up with Faith?
L551419	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
L551418	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
L551417	u3059	m200	MAX	Naawww.
L551416	u3057	m200	LENNY	So there never was a death squad.
L551414	u3059	m200	MAX	You got froggy on me a couple times.
L551413	u3057	m200	LENNY	You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
L551412	u3059	m200	MAX	No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
L551411	u3057	m200	LENNY	And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
L551410	u3059	m200	MAX	Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
L551409	u3059	m200	MAX	I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
L551408	u3057	m200	LENNY	I won't say anything.
L551407	u3059	m200	MAX	Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
L551405	u3059	m200	MAX	You bet.  Did you like it?
L551404	u3057	m200	LENNY	Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
L551403	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
L551402	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
L551401	u3059	m200	MAX	That's pretty much the way it happened.
L551400	u3057	m200	LENNY	So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
L551399	u3059	m200	MAX	You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
L551398	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus!
L551397	u3059	m200	MAX	You just did.
L551396	u3057	m200	LENNY	What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
L551395	u3059	m200	MAX	I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
L551394	u3057	m200	LENNY	Where's Faith?
L551393	u3059	m200	MAX	I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
L551392	u3059	m200	MAX	Only way I could stand your ties.
L551391	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
L551321	u3059	m200	MAX	I intend to.
L551320	u3057	m200	LENNY	2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
L551319	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
L551318	u3057	m200	LENNY	This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
L551317	u3059	m200	MAX	Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
L551316	u3057	m200	LENNY	What do you mean?
L551315	u3059	m200	MAX	He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
L551269	u3059	m200	MAX	No.  Bad idea.
L551268	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay... what about Strickland?
L551267	u3059	m200	MAX	Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
L551264	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
L551263	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
L551262	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus.
L551261	u3059	m200	MAX	Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
L551260	u3057	m200	LENNY	What stuff?
L551259	u3059	m200	MAX	All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
L551258	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whattya mean?
L551252	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
L551251	u3059	m200	MAX	Is he dead?
L551250	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's been cooked-off
L551248	u3057	m200	LENNY	You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
L551247	u3059	m200	MAX	Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
L551119	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
L551118	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
L551117	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
L551116	u3057	m200	LENNY	Looks like she was holding out.
L551115	u3059	m200	MAX	Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
L551114	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith OK?
L551112	u3057	m200	LENNY	W'sup, Max?
L551111	u3059	m200	MAX	Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
L551029	u3057	m200	LENNY	Why me?
L551028	u3059	m200	MAX	That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
L551025	u3057	m200	LENNY	He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
L551024	u3059	m200	MAX	Top ten.
L551023	u3057	m200	LENNY	But this is a bad one.
L551022	u3059	m200	MAX	So've I.  Too much.
L551021	u3057	m200	LENNY	So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
L551020	u3059	m200	MAX	But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
L551019	u3057	m200	LENNY	He records himself raping and killing her--
L551018	u3059	m200	MAX	And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
L551017	u3057	m200	LENNY	He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
L551016	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
L551015	u3057	m200	LENNY	Not now... I don't want to think about it--
L551014	u3059	m200	MAX	Let's work it.
L551013	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  No, not really.
L551012	u3059	m200	MAX	You alright?  Y'okay?
L550976	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm on her.
L550975	u3057	m200	LENNY	Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
L550974	u3059	m200	MAX	I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
L550973	u3057	m200	LENNY	You should feel like shit.
L550972	u3059	m200	MAX	I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
L550971	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
L550826	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shutup a second!
L550825	u3059	m200	MAX	I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
L550818	u3059	m200	MAX	An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
L550817	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
L550816	u3059	m200	MAX	See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
L550798	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, Iris, you okay?
L550797	u3059	m200	MAX	I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
L550796	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
L550795	u3059	m200	MAX	Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
L550794	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  She won't call me.
L550792	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
L550791	u3057	m200	LENNY	You were lucky, Max.
L550789	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
L550788	u3059	m200	MAX	That's not sayin' much.
L550787	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
L550786	u3059	m200	MAX	D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
L550785	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks, Max.
L550784	u3059	m200	MAX	Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
L550781	u3057	m200	LENNY	Least you can do.
L550780	u3059	m200	MAX	Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
L550779	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
L550778	u3059	m200	MAX	You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
L551155	u3057	m200	LENNY	She never gave me a tape.
L551154	u3061	m200	TICK	I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
L551153	u3057	m200	LENNY	What clip?  What was it?
L551152	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
L551151	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
L551150	u3061	m200	TICK	Iris, man.  Pay attention.
L551149	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who was just here?
L551148	u3061	m200	TICK	Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
L551147	u3057	m200	LENNY	What?
L551146	u3061	m200	TICK	Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
L551143	u3061	m200	TICK	Well... the guy's fucked up.
L551142	u3057	m200	LENNY	Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
L551141	u3061	m200	TICK	Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
L550690	u3057	m200	LENNY	What else you got?
L550689	u3061	m200	TICK	Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
L550688	u3057	m200	LENNY	I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
L550687	u3061	m200	TICK	Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
L550686	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
L550685	u3061	m200	TICK	Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
L550684	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
L550683	u3061	m200	TICK	Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
L550682	u3061	m200	TICK	Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
L550681	u3057	m200	LENNY	So lay it off to somebody else.
L550680	u3061	m200	TICK	Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
L550679	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
L550678	u3061	m200	TICK	Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
L550677	u3057	m200	LENNY	Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
L550676	u3061	m200	TICK	I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
L550675	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
L550674	u3061	m200	TICK	With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
L550673	u3057	m200	LENNY	How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
L550672	u3061	m200	TICK	Sorry.
L550671	u3057	m200	LENNY	Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
L550670	u3061	m200	TICK	Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
L551055	u3062	m200	TRAN	I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
L551054	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's alright.  He means it.
L551053	u3062	m200	TRAN	Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
L551052	u3057	m200	LENNY	Charm.
L550928	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
L550927	u3062	m200	TRAN	About what?
L550924	u3057	m200	LENNY	Faith, can I talk to you a second?
L550923	u3062	m200	TRAN	I always do.
L550922	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
L550921	u3062	m200	TRAN	Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
L550918	u3062	m200	TRAN	I already got everything I need from you.
L550917	u3057	m200	LENNY	You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
L550916	u3062	m200	TRAN	You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
L550873	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Your existence.
L550872	u3057	m200	LENNY	Your sex life?
L550871	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
L550870	u3057	m200	LENNY	I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
L550869	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
L550868	u3057	m200	LENNY	Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
L550867	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Commissioner Strickland.
L550866	u3057	m200	LENNY	Strickland.
L550865	u3060	m200	STRICKLAND	Nero.
L551451	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  See you there.
L551450	u3057	m200	LENNY	See you downtown.
L551449	u3058	m200	MACE	Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
L551448	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  We did.
L551447	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
L551443	u3057	m200	LENNY	Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
L551442	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we under arrest?
L551363	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, right.  Fucked.
L551362	u3057	m200	LENNY	Then we'll be right where we are now.
L551361	u3058	m200	MACE	Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
L551360	u3057	m200	LENNY	No.  Trust me.
L551359	u3058	m200	MACE	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
L551358	u3057	m200	LENNY	Take it to him.
L551354	u3057	m200	LENNY	Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
L551353	u3058	m200	MACE	That's the original.  There are no copies.
L551352	u3057	m200	LENNY	I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
L551351	u3058	m200	MACE	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
L551350	u3057	m200	LENNY	Alright.  We're going up.
L551348	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.
L551347	u3057	m200	LENNY	You see Tran?
L551346	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
L551345	u3057	m200	LENNY	Got your ticket?
L551344	u3058	m200	MACE	Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
L551343	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace... you're a girl.
L551340	u3058	m200	MACE	No, it's not.
L551339	u3057	m200	LENNY	But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
L551338	u3058	m200	MACE	You never told me.
L551337	u3057	m200	LENNY	I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
L551336	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  It didn't.
L551335	u3057	m200	LENNY	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
L551334	u3058	m200	MACE	I guess.
L551333	u3057	m200	LENNY	It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
L551332	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
L551325	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
L551324	u3057	m200	LENNY	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
L551323	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm not going.
L551322	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
L551294	u3058	m200	MACE	Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
L551293	u3057	m200	LENNY	Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
L551271	u3057	m200	LENNY	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
L551270	u3058	m200	MACE	Who's Strickland?
L551266	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, right, blow it open.
L551265	u3058	m200	MACE	The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
L551254	u3058	m200	MACE	How long does it last?  Oh.
L551253	u3057	m200	LENNY	He's totally cut off from the outer world.
L551246	u3057	m200	LENNY	To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
L551245	u3058	m200	MACE	Why?
L551244	u3057	m200	LENNY	I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
L551243	u3058	m200	MACE	I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
L551242	u3057	m200	LENNY	It was a tough call.
L551241	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
L551240	u3057	m200	LENNY	There's a plus side?
L551239	u3058	m200	MACE	Well, look at the plus side.
L551238	u3057	m200	LENNY	So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
L551232	u3057	m200	LENNY	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
L551231	u3058	m200	MACE	People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
L551230	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've got a good idea, yeah.
L551229	u3058	m200	MACE	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
L551228	u3057	m200	LENNY	We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
L551226	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
L551225	u3058	m200	MACE	I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
L551224	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
L551203	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
L551202	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh unh.  I won't do it.
L551201	u3057	m200	LENNY	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
L551200	u3058	m200	MACE	Tell me.
L551192	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
L551191	u3058	m200	MACE	You sure?
L551190	u3057	m200	LENNY	Those two guys were cops.
L551186	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
L551185	u3058	m200	MACE	I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
L551180	u3058	m200	MACE	Fire's out, isn't it?
L551179	u3057	m200	LENNY	Are you out of your fucking mind?!
L551178	u3057	m200	LENNY	The gas tank's going to go any second!
L551177	u3058	m200	MACE	This is bad.
L551176	u3058	m200	MACE	It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
L551175	u3057	m200	LENNY	Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
L551174	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
L551173	u3057	m200	LENNY	Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
L551172	u3058	m200	MACE	Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
L551171	u3057	m200	LENNY	Shit!
L551166	u3057	m200	LENNY	It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
L551165	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, give them the tape.
L551158	u3058	m200	MACE	Something in your car...
L551157	u3057	m200	LENNY	She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
L551156	u3058	m200	MACE	Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
L551135	u3057	m200	LENNY	"Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful."
L551134	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, have you lost it completely?
L551131	u3057	m200	LENNY	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
L551130	u3058	m200	MACE	You better keep a low profile for a while.
L551129	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
L551128	u3058	m200	MACE	Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
L551126	u3057	m200	LENNY	This tie doesn't go with blue!
L551125	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L551123	u3057	m200	LENNY	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
L551122	u3058	m200	MACE	Where we going?
L551121	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace!
L551120	u3058	m200	MACE	Whatup Lenny?
L551103	u3057	m200	LENNY	S'okay.  I know you still love me.
L551102	u3058	m200	MACE	I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
L551101	u3058	m200	MACE	OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
L551100	u3057	m200	LENNY	How's Zander?
L551099	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure.
L551098	u3057	m200	LENNY	The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
L551097	u3058	m200	MACE	Now you're really getting paranoid.
L551096	u3057	m200	LENNY	And what about the guy that was following me?
L551095	u3058	m200	MACE	That's where it gets a little strange.
L551094	u3057	m200	LENNY	Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
L551093	u3058	m200	MACE	Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
L551092	u3057	m200	LENNY	If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
L551091	u3058	m200	MACE	So the guy's not a sicko.
L551090	u3057	m200	LENNY	"She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason."
L551089	u3058	m200	MACE	Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
L551088	u3057	m200	LENNY	No it doesn't.
L551087	u3058	m200	MACE	But that doesn't add, does it.
L551086	u3057	m200	LENNY	See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
L551083	u3058	m200	MACE	It's not your fault.
L551082	u3057	m200	LENNY	She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
L551081	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
L551080	u3058	m200	MACE	No more, Lenny.
L551079	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
L551078	u3058	m200	MACE	Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
L551077	u3057	m200	LENNY	It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
L551076	u3058	m200	MACE	So that gives you something.
L551075	u3057	m200	LENNY	He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
L551073	u3057	m200	LENNY	Never really thought about it.
L551072	u3058	m200	MACE	You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
L551071	u3057	m200	LENNY	Is this great fabric or what?
L551039	u3058	m200	MACE	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
L551038	u3057	m200	LENNY	Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
L551035	u3058	m200	MACE	This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
L551034	u3057	m200	LENNY	Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
L551031	u3057	m200	LENNY	I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
L551030	u3058	m200	MACE	Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
L551027	u3057	m200	LENNY	Wants to share.
L551026	u3058	m200	MACE	And gives it to you.
L551008	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you sure it's real?
L551007	u3057	m200	LENNY	Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
L551006	u3058	m200	MACE	Blackjack?  I don't understand--
L551005	u3057	m200	LENNY	Black.  Jack.
L551004	u3058	m200	MACE	My God, Lenny.  What is it?
L551000	u3057	m200	LENNY	Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
L550999	u3058	m200	MACE	What is it?
L550995	u3057	m200	LENNY	No idea.
L550994	u3058	m200	MACE	What's that?  Present from Faith?
L550993	u3057	m200	LENNY	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
L550992	u3058	m200	MACE	What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
L550991	u3057	m200	LENNY	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
L550990	u3058	m200	MACE	You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
L550915	u3057	m200	LENNY	You'll see.
L550914	u3058	m200	MACE	Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
L550913	u3057	m200	LENNY	She's my destiny.
L550912	u3058	m200	MACE	She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
L550911	u3057	m200	LENNY	She still loves me.
L550910	u3058	m200	MACE	Forget her.
L550909	u3057	m200	LENNY	Rams... that's football, right?
L550908	u3058	m200	MACE	Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
L550907	u3057	m200	LENNY	Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
L550905	u3058	m200	MACE	Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
L550904	u3057	m200	LENNY	Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
L550903	u3058	m200	MACE	Jesus, Lenny.
L550902	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
L550901	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
L550900	u3057	m200	LENNY	You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
L550899	u3058	m200	MACE	Look, I gotta get some sleep.
L550898	u3057	m200	LENNY	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
L550897	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
L550896	u3057	m200	LENNY	Macey... I've never seen you like this.
L550895	u3058	m200	MACE	No, you're just trying to get off.
L550894	u3057	m200	LENNY	So am I.  Just trying to get by.
L550893	u3058	m200	MACE	No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
L550892	u3057	m200	LENNY	I thought we were friends.
L550891	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
L550890	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
L550889	u3057	m200	LENNY	That would be no.
L550887	u3058	m200	MACE	Get it.
L550886	u3057	m200	LENNY	I need my case.  It's still in the back.
L550884	u3057	m200	LENNY	In LA?  Are you crazy?
L550883	u3058	m200	MACE	I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
L550882	u3057	m200	LENNY	Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
L550876	u3057	m200	LENNY	Let's talk in the car.
L550875	u3058	m200	MACE	Are we having a bad night?
L550864	u3058	m200	MACE	You will not live to see the morning.
L550863	u3057	m200	LENNY	Coming with you.
L550862	u3058	m200	MACE	What the fuck are you doing?
L550860	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
L550859	u3058	m200	MACE	Fumitsu.
L550858	u3057	m200	LENNY	What's his name?
L550856	u3058	m200	MACE	Define love.
L550855	u3057	m200	LENNY	Yeah, but that was for love.
L550854	u3058	m200	MACE	Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
L550853	u3057	m200	LENNY	Define illegal.
L550852	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this shit's illegal.
L550851	u3057	m200	LENNY	Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
L550850	u3058	m200	MACE	Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
L550849	u3057	m200	LENNY	Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
L550848	u3058	m200	MACE	Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
L550847	u3057	m200	LENNY	Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
L550846	u3058	m200	MACE	Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
L550845	u3057	m200	LENNY	No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
L550844	u3058	m200	MACE	So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
L550843	u3058	m200	MACE	Driving Mr. Lenny.
L550842	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace!  You're a life-saver.
L550841	u3058	m200	MACE	Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
L550840	u3058	m200	MACE	Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
L550839	u3057	m200	LENNY	Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
L550838	u3058	m200	MACE	Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
L550837	u3057	m200	LENNY	Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
L550836	u3058	m200	MACE	Sleaze to peddle.
L550835	u3057	m200	LENNY	Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
L550834	u3058	m200	MACE	Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
L550833	u3057	m200	LENNY	Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
L550820	u3057	m200	LENNY	They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
L550819	u3058	m200	MACE	Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
L551195	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Aw, Mom!
L551194	u3058	m200	MACE	We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
L551110	u3058	m200	MACE	Well give me some then... I'm starving.
L551109	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
L551108	u3058	m200	MACE	What is that?
L551107	u3058	m200	MACE	Are you going to make me beg?
L551106	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Right.  That explains it.
L551105	u3058	m200	MACE	Just Lenny.
L551104	u3063	m200	ZANDER	Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
L551276	u3059	m200	MAX	You really want that on your head?
L551275	u3058	m200	MACE	Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
L551274	u3059	m200	MAX	Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
L551273	u3058	m200	MACE	So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
L551257	u3059	m200	MAX	There's more to this whole thing than you think.
L551256	u3058	m200	MACE	This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
L551255	u3059	m200	MAX	Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
L551037	u3058	m200	MACE	Take the tape to the cops.
L551036	u3059	m200	MAX	Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
L551033	u3058	m200	MACE	Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
L551032	u3059	m200	MAX	He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
L550830	u3059	m200	MAX	Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
L550829	u3058	m200	MACE	But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
L550828	u3059	m200	MAX	Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L550827	u3058	m200	MACE	Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
L550822	u3059	m200	MAX	Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
L550821	u3058	m200	MACE	No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
L591383	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
L591382	u3186	m210	ALEX	Was that it? Well, ok.
L591334	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
L591333	u3186	m210	ALEX	You're wrong.
L591332	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
L591327	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
L591326	u3186	m210	ALEX	You sent them. I had no choice.
L591325	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
L591321	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
L591320	u3186	m210	ALEX	I'm looking for my friends.
L591319	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
L591317	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
L591316	u3186	m210	ALEX	Where are they? Last chance.
L591315	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
L591314	u3186	m210	ALEX	Where are they?
L591313	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I hate that picture.
L591259	u3186	m210	ALEX	What? Call the police?
L591258	u3196	m210	WALSH	I think we should get some support?
L591257	u3186	m210	ALEX	Where is it? This place?
L591249	u3196	m210	WALSH	I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
L591248	u3186	m210	ALEX	The strip joint?
L591247	u3196	m210	WALSH	"We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called ""The Hole."""
L591246	u3186	m210	ALEX	Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
L591168	u3196	m210	WALSH	Yeah. I sure will.
L591167	u3186	m210	ALEX	I was hoping you'd find out.
L591166	u3196	m210	WALSH	What do they do that they had to kill her?
L591165	u3186	m210	ALEX	Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
L591164	u3196	m210	WALSH	I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
L591163	u3186	m210	ALEX	You think I'm crazy.
L591162	u3186	m210	ALEX	The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 
L591161	u3196	m210	WALSH	Down? Wait, don't tell me.
L591160	u3186	m210	ALEX	Two down. Two to go.
L591157	u3186	m210	ALEX	Dream on.
L591156	u3196	m210	WALSH	Check and mate.
L590849	u3196	m210	WALSH	Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
L590848	u3186	m210	ALEX	We won't.
L590847	u3196	m210	WALSH	Tell her... we'll get him.
L590846	u3186	m210	ALEX	What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
L591004	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
L591003	u3186	m210	ALEX	You killed her. I saw it.
L591000	u3188	m210	DUTTON	There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
L590999	u3186	m210	ALEX	A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
L590998	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Fuck! What do you want?
L590996	u3186	m210	ALEX	"This is not just some ""thing."" It's A C zero zero five."
L590995	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Keep that thing away from me.
L590994	u3186	m210	ALEX	Think maybe knives do?
L590993	u3186	m210	ALEX	I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
L590992	u3188	m210	DUTTON	That was a fucking hollow point!
L590964	u3193	m210	TOMMY	A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
L590963	u3186	m210	ALEX	What did they give you?
L590962	u3193	m210	TOMMY	"They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head ""yes."""
L590961	u3186	m210	ALEX	What did they give you?
L590955	u3193	m210	TOMMY	Who are you?
L590954	u3186	m210	ALEX	Wrong. Answer.
L590953	u3193	m210	TOMMY	There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
L590952	u3186	m210	ALEX	One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
L590951	u3193	m210	TOMMY	What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
L590950	u3186	m210	ALEX	You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
L590949	u3193	m210	TOMMY	Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
L590948	u3186	m210	ALEX	Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
L590947	u3193	m210	TOMMY	I don't know you, man.
L590946	u3186	m210	ALEX	You lied at my trial.
L590945	u3186	m210	ALEX	Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
L590944	u3193	m210	TOMMY	Where the fuck did you come from?
L590943	u3186	m210	ALEX	Sssshhh. She's resting.
L591302	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	There is no scar. I'm telling you.
L591301	u3186	m210	ALEX	The scar.
L591300	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	Fucking Zombie.
L591299	u3186	m210	ALEX	Good thing in a situation like this.
L591298	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
L591297	u3186	m210	ALEX	AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
L591296	u3194	m210	TOOMEY	What Scar? What fucking scar?
L591295	u3186	m210	ALEX	"We're going to play a little game called ""Who's got the Scar."""
L591074	u3186	m210	ALEX	I was talking about you.
L591073	u3190	m210	ERLICH	You're him. Corvis.
L591072	u3186	m210	ALEX	How can you die if you're already dead?
L591071	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
L591069	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Nobody.
L591068	u3186	m210	ALEX	The scar. Which of you has it?
L591067	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
L591066	u3186	m210	ALEX	I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
L591065	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Not my arm! What you fucking want?
L591062	u3186	m210	ALEX	What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
L591061	u3190	m210	ERLICH	Fuck. Me.
L591058	u3186	m210	ALEX	I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
L591057	u3190	m210	ERLICH	You're the guy killed Dutton.
L591056	u3186	m210	ALEX	I heard you were looking for this.
L591388	u3186	m210	ALEX	Erin. I'll always be with you.
L591387	u3189	m210	ERIN	In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
L591360	u3189	m210	ERIN	No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
L591359	u3186	m210	ALEX	... it connects you to me...
L591256	u3189	m210	ERIN	I don't know. I found him lying there.
L591255	u3186	m210	ALEX	Erin. Who?
L591254	u3189	m210	ERIN	It's not. I can't take it.
L591253	u3186	m210	ALEX	It's ok, it's ok...
L591223	u3186	m210	ALEX	It's what Lauren would do.
L591222	u3189	m210	ERIN	I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
L591221	u3189	m210	ERIN	I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
L591220	u3186	m210	ALEX	All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
L591219	u3189	m210	ERIN	My father.
L591218	u3186	m210	ALEX	You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
L591217	u3186	m210	ALEX	Have to find him first.
L591216	u3189	m210	ERIN	So you're going to kill him?
L591215	u3186	m210	ALEX	... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
L591189	u3189	m210	ERIN	I don't want to see!
L591188	u3186	m210	ALEX	This tree. Here's where it happened.
L591180	u3189	m210	ERIN	Yes I do, I really do.
L591179	u3186	m210	ALEX	No. You don't.
L591178	u3189	m210	ERIN	It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
L591177	u3186	m210	ALEX	Erin. It's not your fault.
L591176	u3189	m210	ERIN	... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
L591175	u3186	m210	ALEX	No...
L591174	u3189	m210	ERIN	When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
L591173	u3186	m210	ALEX	Are you ok?
L591172	u3189	m210	ERIN	Yeah, I know.
L591171	u3186	m210	ALEX	This is where it happened. Right over here.
L591089	u3186	m210	ALEX	Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
L591088	u3189	m210	ERIN	No! Why are you haunting me?
L591087	u3186	m210	ALEX	From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
L591086	u3186	m210	ALEX	No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
L591085	u3189	m210	ERIN	My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
L591084	u3186	m210	ALEX	I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
L591082	u3189	m210	ERIN	You killed Lauren! You killed her!
L591081	u3186	m210	ALEX	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
L591080	u3189	m210	ERIN	I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
L591079	u3186	m210	ALEX	And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
L591078	u3189	m210	ERIN	You killed that cop Dutton.
L591077	u3186	m210	ALEX	I told you, I knew your sister.
L591076	u3189	m210	ERIN	Daisy. How did you know?
L590934	u3189	m210	ERIN	Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
L590933	u3186	m210	ALEX	I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
L590932	u3189	m210	ERIN	How do you know?
L590931	u3186	m210	ALEX	He didn't kill her.
L590930	u3189	m210	ERIN	You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
L590929	u3186	m210	ALEX	Someone else did it.
L590928	u3189	m210	ERIN	And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
L590927	u3186	m210	ALEX	Your father gave them to both of you.
L590926	u3189	m210	ERIN	Yeah, no kidding.
L590925	u3186	m210	ALEX	That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
L590924	u3189	m210	ERIN	I know her friends.
L590923	u3186	m210	ALEX	I was a friend of your sister's.
L591354	u3191	m210	MADDEN	You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
L591353	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
L591347	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
L591346	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Doubt is a motherfucker.
L591345	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Just don't believe everything you see.
L591212	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
L591211	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
L591208	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
L591207	u3191	m210	MADDEN	How about sign of a big black bird?
L591206	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Sign of the dead come back to life.
L591205	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Fucking crow.
L591202	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
L591201	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Could say that.
L591200	u3191	m210	MADDEN	They botched the execution.
L591116	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Good for you. You do know something.
L591115	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Guy dressed for Halloween?
L591114	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
L591113	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
L591110	u3191	m210	MADDEN	I know the guy leaves a sign.
L591109	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	You know.
L591108	u3191	m210	MADDEN	I know.
L591107	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
L591106	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Shut up.
L591105	u3191	m210	MADDEN	Yeah, we do.
L591104	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
L591241	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Erin knows, doesn't she?
L591240	u3192	m210	RANDALL	I do. Every day.
L591239	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
L591238	u3192	m210	RANDALL	She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
L591237	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	An accident, Nathan.
L591236	u3192	m210	RANDALL	You killed my daughter.
L591235	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
L591234	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	I mean Lauren.
L591233	u3192	m210	RANDALL	You mean Alex.
L591232	u3187	m210	CAPTAIN	Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
L590981	u3188	m210	DUTTON	What did I say?
L590980	u3195	m210	TRACY	Look, can I just call a cab?
L590979	u3188	m210	DUTTON	I want you... to bend over.
L590978	u3195	m210	TRACY	You want me to walk a straight line?
L590975	u3195	m210	TRACY	Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
L590974	u3188	m210	DUTTON	If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
L590973	u3195	m210	TRACY	Not tonight. Honest.
L590972	u3188	m210	DUTTON	But you, you've had them.
L590971	u3195	m210	TRACY	She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
L590970	u3188	m210	DUTTON	What's with your friend there?
L590969	u3188	m210	DUTTON	Let's hope not. License and registration please.
L590968	u3195	m210	TRACY	Anything wrong?
L591139	u3189	m210	ERIN	I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
L591138	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Please. Come inside.
L591137	u3189	m210	ERIN	I don't believe you.
L591136	u3192	m210	RANDALL	I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
L591135	u3189	m210	ERIN	Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
L591134	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Sweetheart...
L591133	u3192	m210	RANDALL	About them. You've got to leave it alone.
L591132	u3189	m210	ERIN	About you.
L591131	u3192	m210	RANDALL	They killed her because she found out.
L591130	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
L591129	u3189	m210	ERIN	Stay away from me! Stay away!
L591128	u3192	m210	RANDALL	No.
L591127	u3189	m210	ERIN	You killed her!
L591126	u3192	m210	RANDALL	It's not what you think.
L591125	u3189	m210	ERIN	You're in with them.
L591123	u3192	m210	RANDALL	Looks like you have them both on.
L591122	u3189	m210	ERIN	I think I dropped an earring.
L591039	u3189	m210	ERIN	He said he'd prove it.
L591038	u3192	m210	RANDALL	It still doesn't mean...

L596394	u3209	m212	DAVID	If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
L596393	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Where's Star, David?!
L596392	u3209	m212	DAVID	Hey, take it easy.
L596391	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Where is she?!
L596194	u3209	m212	DAVID	What's goin' on, Marko?
L596193	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What's going' on?
L596178	u3209	m212	DAVID	Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
L596177	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'm my own man.
L596108	u3209	m212	DAVID	Why?  They're only noodles.
L596107	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't!  Stop!

L596100	u3209	m212	DAVID	So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
L596074	u3209	m212	DAVID	Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
L596073	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We were gonna grab some food.
L596066	u3209	m212	DAVID	You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
L596065	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I can't beat a Triumph.
L596063	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Star?...
L596062	u3209	m212	DAVID	C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
L596061	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	That's right.
L596060	u3209	m212	DAVID	Honda 250, huh?
L596059	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We still going?
L596565	u3209	m212	DAVID	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
L596564	u3217	m212	STAR	I will, David!
L596563	u3209	m212	DAVID	You can't kill me, Star.
L596176	u3209	m212	DAVID	You're almost one of us now, Michael.
L596175	u3217	m212	STAR	Look.
L596104	u3209	m212	DAVID	Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
L596103	u3217	m212	STAR	Leave him alone.
L596072	u3209	m212	DAVID	No.  Stick around.
L596071	u3217	m212	STAR	C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
L596055	u3217	m212	STAR	Yeah.
L596054	u3209	m212	DAVID	With him?
L596053	u3217	m212	STAR	For a ride.
L596052	u3209	m212	DAVID	Where you going?
L596501	u3210	m212	EDGAR	The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
L596500	u3216	m212	SAM	What happens in tow and a half hours?
L596499	u3210	m212	EDGAR	We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
L596490	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
L596489	u3216	m212	SAM	No, Nanook!  Quiet!
L596477	u3216	m212	SAM	There's a cop behind us.
L596476	u3210	m212	EDGAR	What?
L596475	u3216	m212	SAM	Oh, no...
L596463	u3210	m212	EDGAR	That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
L596462	u3216	m212	SAM	I thought they'd be in coffins.
L596461	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
L596460	u3216	m212	SAM	What's that smell!?
L596447	u3216	m212	SAM	Chill out Edgar.
L596446	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
L596437	u3210	m212	EDGAR	To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
L596436	u3216	m212	SAM	He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
L596378	u3216	m212	SAM	Hit the lights again.
L596377	u3210	m212	EDGAR	He's not glowing.
L596332	u3216	m212	SAM	How do you know they're not?
L596331	u3210	m212	EDGAR	I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
L596329	u3216	m212	SAM	Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
L596328	u3210	m212	EDGAR	That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
L596327	u3216	m212	SAM	I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
L596271	u3216	m212	SAM	I can't do that!
L596270	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
L596266	u3216	m212	SAM	His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
L596265	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
L596151	u3216	m212	SAM	Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
L596150	u3210	m212	EDGAR	This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
L596147	u3210	m212	EDGAR	You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
L596146	u3216	m212	SAM	Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
L596145	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Or a vampire.
L596003	u3216	m212	SAM	Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
L596002	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
L596001	u3216	m212	SAM	And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
L596533	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Sam, don't --
L596532	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Don't go out there!  Stop him!
L596443	u3210	m212	EDGAR	Okay, okay.
L596442	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
L596440	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'll take you there.
L596439	u3210	m212	EDGAR	I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
L596438	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	David.
L596435	u3210	m212	EDGAR	If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
L596434	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Of course not!
L596342	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
L596341	u3213	m212	LUCY	'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
L596340	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Max?  You men we're having company again?
L596339	u3213	m212	LUCY	I told Max eight o'clock.
L596338	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Smells good.  When do we eat?
L596081	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
L596080	u3213	m212	LUCY	Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
L596079	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Closet monster!?
L596078	u3213	m212	LUCY	I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
L595962	u3213	m212	LUCY	When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
L595961	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Ouch, my hair...
L595960	u3213	m212	LUCY	A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
L595959	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
L596520	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	I better get cleaned up, then.
L596519	u3216	m212	SAM	I guess so.  She said not to be late.
L596518	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Did we have a date tonight?
L596517	u3216	m212	SAM	Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
L596129	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
L596128	u3216	m212	SAM	I thought we were goin' into town.
L596127	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Are we havin' fun or what?
L596124	u3216	m212	SAM	Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
L596123	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
L596122	u3216	m212	SAM	Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
L596121	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Whatcha doin' over here?
L596120	u3216	m212	SAM	Good!
L596119	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
L596118	u3216	m212	SAM	Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
L596084	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	Lots more where he came from.
L596083	u3216	m212	SAM	Thanks, Grandpa...
L595976	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
L595975	u3216	m212	SAM	You have a T.V.?
L595974	u3211	m212	GRANDPA	... And stay outta here.
L596191	u3212	m212	LADDIE	You better not like him too much.
L596190	u3217	m212	STAR	I like Michael.
L596189	u3212	m212	LADDIE	You like Michael.
L596188	u3217	m212	STAR	Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
L596187	u3212	m212	LADDIE	No.  Just you.
L596186	u3217	m212	STAR	You didn't tell David?
L596185	u3217	m212	STAR	No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
L596184	u3212	m212	LADDIE	It was a dream, Star.
L596183	u3217	m212	STAR	Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
L596182	u3212	m212	LADDIE	I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
L596181	u3217	m212	STAR	Who, Laddie?
L596180	u3212	m212	LADDIE	I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
L596058	u3217	m212	STAR	This is Michael.
L596057	u3212	m212	LADDIE	Hi... I'm Laddie.
L596592	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Get out, Mom!  Run!
L596591	u3213	m212	LUCY	Michael!...
L596590	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
L596346	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Gotta go, Mom.
L596345	u3213	m212	LUCY	There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
L596344	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Can't.  Got plans of my own.
L596343	u3213	m212	LUCY	Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
L596313	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Mom... please.
L596312	u3213	m212	LUCY	Wait a minute, kiddo.
L596311	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'm tired now.
L596310	u3213	m212	LUCY	-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
L596309	u3213	m212	LUCY	Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
L596308	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We are...
L596307	u3213	m212	LUCY	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
L596306	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Sure.
L596218	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Okay.
L596217	u3213	m212	LUCY	Okay?
L596216	u3213	m212	LUCY	Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
L596215	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
L596214	u3213	m212	LUCY	Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
L596213	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No.  I'm up.
L596212	u3213	m212	LUCY	Michael, are you still in bed?
L596036	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'll pass.
L596035	u3213	m212	LUCY	I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
L596034	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	See you later.
L596021	u3213	m212	LUCY	Oh, no, you won't.
L596020	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'll hitch.
L596019	u3213	m212	LUCY	Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
L596018	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
L595950	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	He's not breathing, Mom.
L595949	u3213	m212	LUCY	He's just a deep sleeper.
L595948	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	He looks dead.
L595939	u3213	m212	LUCY	For everything.
L595938	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	For what.
L595937	u3213	m212	LUCY	Still mad at me?
L596576	u3213	m212	LUCY	What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
L596575	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom!
L596574	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ohmygod...
L596512	u3216	m212	SAM	-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
L596511	u3213	m212	LUCY	There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
L596510	u3216	m212	SAM	No, I'm not...
L596509	u3213	m212	LUCY	Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
L596508	u3216	m212	SAM	But, Mom...
L596507	u3213	m212	LUCY	Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
L596506	u3216	m212	SAM	This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
L596505	u3213	m212	LUCY	Not funny, Sam!
L596504	u3216	m212	SAM	Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
L596503	u3213	m212	LUCY	What did you say?
L596376	u3216	m212	SAM	Must be a circuit breaker.
L596375	u3213	m212	LUCY	Oh, no.  Now what?
L596365	u3216	m212	SAM	C'mere, Nanook.
L596364	u3213	m212	LUCY	Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
L596361	u3213	m212	LUCY	No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
L596360	u3216	m212	SAM	Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
L596359	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
L596358	u3216	m212	SAM	These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
L596297	u3213	m212	LUCY	Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
L596296	u3216	m212	SAM	Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
L596295	u3213	m212	LUCY	In here?
L596294	u3216	m212	SAM	Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
L596291	u3216	m212	SAM	He's already gone to bed.
L596290	u3213	m212	LUCY	Where's Michael?
L596289	u3216	m212	SAM	Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
L596288	u3213	m212	LUCY	Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
L596280	u3216	m212	SAM	We can't talk about it on the phone.
L596279	u3213	m212	LUCY	What's wrong?  Tell me.
L596278	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
L596277	u3213	m212	LUCY	Sam.  Is everything all right?
L596086	u3216	m212	SAM	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
L596085	u3213	m212	LUCY	Lights out, Sam.
L596026	u3216	m212	SAM	Can we get a T.V.?
L596025	u3213	m212	LUCY	I guess no one cares what I got a job.
L596024	u3216	m212	SAM	He met a girl.
L595969	u3213	m212	LUCY	Soon.
L595968	u3216	m212	SAM	Help me, Mom.  Help.
L595947	u3216	m212	SAM	So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
L595946	u3213	m212	LUCY	You've heard this story before?
L595945	u3216	m212	SAM	When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
L595936	u3213	m212	LUCY	Not that poor.
L595935	u3216	m212	SAM	I thought we were poor.
L595934	u3213	m212	LUCY	Tell them to get something to eat.
L595932	u3216	m212	SAM	Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
L595931	u3213	m212	LUCY	That's the boardwalk, Sam.
L595930	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
L595924	u3213	m212	LUCY	Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
L595923	u3216	m212	SAM	Smells like something died.
L595922	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ocean air!
L595921	u3216	m212	SAM	What's that smell?
L595920	u3213	m212	LUCY	We're getting close...
L596588	u3214	m212	MAX	It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
L596587	u3213	m212	LUCY	Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
L596580	u3214	m212	MAX	It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
L596579	u3213	m212	LUCY	Max... what are you talking about?
L596529	u3214	m212	MAX	Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
L596528	u3213	m212	LUCY	I thought you said they needed discipline?
L596527	u3214	m212	MAX	Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
L596526	u3213	m212	LUCY	No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
L596525	u3214	m212	MAX	Something the matter?
L596524	u3213	m212	LUCY	I hope so.
L596523	u3214	m212	MAX	Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
L596390	u3214	m212	MAX	I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
L596389	u3213	m212	LUCY	He doesn't walk all over me.
L596388	u3214	m212	MAX	Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
L596387	u3213	m212	LUCY	I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
L596386	u3214	m212	MAX	Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
L596385	u3213	m212	LUCY	I'm really sorry, Max.
L596369	u3214	m212	MAX	It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
L596368	u3213	m212	LUCY	Max!  What's wrong?
L596363	u3213	m212	LUCY	Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
L596362	u3214	m212	MAX	This looks terrific, Lucy.
L596356	u3214	m212	MAX	Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
L596355	u3213	m212	LUCY	You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
L596354	u3214	m212	MAX	Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
L596247	u3213	m212	LUCY	I hear this is the decade for cute.
L596246	u3214	m212	MAX	Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
L596245	u3213	m212	LUCY	I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
L596244	u3214	m212	MAX	But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
L596243	u3213	m212	LUCY	You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
L596242	u3214	m212	MAX	So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
L596241	u3213	m212	LUCY	Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
L596240	u3214	m212	MAX	Not impressed, are you?
L596163	u3214	m212	MAX	I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
L596162	u3213	m212	LUCY	You're cute, Max.
L596159	u3213	m212	LUCY	Hi, Thorn.
L596158	u3214	m212	MAX	Say hello to Thorn.
L595993	u3213	m212	LUCY	Do I look that needy?
L595992	u3214	m212	MAX	-- a job.
L595991	u3213	m212	LUCY	I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
L595990	u3214	m212	MAX	So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
L595989	u3213	m212	LUCY	Lucy.
L595988	u3214	m212	MAX	You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
L596585	u3216	m212	SAM	What?!  Did you know that!?
L596584	u3214	m212	MAX	Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
L596583	u3216	m212	SAM	But you passed the test!
L596384	u3214	m212	MAX	Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
L596383	u3216	m212	SAM	I am?
L596373	u3214	m212	MAX	Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
L596372	u3216	m212	SAM	Does it burn?
L596367	u3214	m212	MAX	Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
L596366	u3216	m212	SAM	How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
L596597	u3217	m212	STAR	So do I!
L596596	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	It's gone.  I feel it!
L596522	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
L596521	u3217	m212	STAR	They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
L596456	u3217	m212	STAR	Save Laddie first.
L596455	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Huh?
L596454	u3217	m212	STAR	Take laddie.
L596453	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	You've got to put this on.
L596421	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
L596420	u3217	m212	STAR	David's looking for me... I have to go.
L596419	u3217	m212	STAR	I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
L596418	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I know, I've felt it...
L596417	u3217	m212	STAR	It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
L596416	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Then it's not too late for us...
L596415	u3217	m212	STAR	Because I love you...
L596414	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Why not?
L596413	u3217	m212	STAR	Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
L596412	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
L596411	u3217	m212	STAR	Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
L596410	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
L596408	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Okay.
L596407	u3217	m212	STAR	I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
L596303	u3217	m212	STAR	Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
L596302	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	When?
L596301	u3217	m212	STAR	Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
L596300	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
L596172	u3217	m212	STAR	No... no, everything's different now...
L596171	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Let's go see them.
L596170	u3217	m212	STAR	No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
L596169	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Now you and David...
L596168	u3217	m212	STAR	I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
L596167	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
L596166	u3217	m212	STAR	Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
L596165	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Ouch.
L596051	u3217	m212	STAR	Okay.
L596050	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
L596049	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
L596048	u3217	m212	STAR	I guess you're new around here.
L596047	u3217	m212	STAR	Michael's great.  I like Michael.
L596046	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I'm Michael.
L596045	u3217	m212	STAR	Me, too.
L596044	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
L596043	u3217	m212	STAR	What do you mean?
L596042	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
L596041	u3217	m212	STAR	Star.
L596040	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What's your name?
L596039	u3217	m212	STAR	If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
L596038	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Hi...
L596014	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I just wanted to... I, uh...
L596013	u3217	m212	STAR	Okay.  Talk.
L596012	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Well... yeah.  Sure.
L596011	u3217	m212	STAR	Did you want to talk to me?
L596010	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Well, I...
L596009	u3217	m212	STAR	Are you following me?
L596571	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
L596570	u3216	m212	SAM	What's the matter?
L596481	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Huh?...
L596480	u3216	m212	SAM	Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
L596425	u3216	m212	SAM	The Marines.
L596424	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Who are you calling?
L596423	u3216	m212	SAM	Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
L596422	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Star.
L596406	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I don't know.
L596405	u3216	m212	SAM	It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
L596287	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
L596286	u3216	m212	SAM	I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
L596285	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
L596284	u3216	m212	SAM	What about Mom?
L596283	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
L596258	u3216	m212	SAM	Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
L596257	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What??
L596256	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	He was protecting <u>you</u>!
L596255	u3216	m212	SAM	What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
L596254	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
L596253	u3216	m212	SAM	What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
L596252	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Nanook...
L596251	u3216	m212	SAM	What happened, Michael!?
L596250	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't turn on the light.
L596249	u3216	m212	SAM	Michael?
L596230	u3216	m212	SAM	You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
L596229	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Piss off.
L596228	u3216	m212	SAM	Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
L596227	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't bother.
L596226	u3216	m212	SAM	I'm making you a sandwich.
L596208	u3216	m212	SAM	No.  On the phone.
L596207	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Mom's home?...
L596142	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No.
L596141	u3216	m212	SAM	Wanna go to the comic book store?
L596140	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
L596139	u3216	m212	SAM	The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
L596138	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	No.  Why?
L596137	u3216	m212	SAM	Did you spill something?
L596134	u3216	m212	SAM	You're right... not even to mention you and me.
L596133	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	What would that make Mom?
L596132	u3216	m212	SAM	You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
L596131	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
L596130	u3216	m212	SAM	What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
L596115	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Entertain yourself.
L596114	u3216	m212	SAM	You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
L596113	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Go away.
L596029	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
L596028	u3216	m212	SAM	Do I have to do this?
L596023	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
L596022	u3216	m212	SAM	Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
L595997	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
L595996	u3216	m212	SAM	Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
L595995	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Nowhere.
L595994	u3216	m212	SAM	Where are we going?
L595979	u3216	m212	SAM	Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
L595978	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	You're beautiful.
L595965	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
L595964	u3216	m212	SAM	I was here first.
L595963	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	This room is mine.
L595958	u3216	m212	SAM	Even poor people have T.V.s
L595957	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
L595956	u3216	m212	SAM	Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
L595955	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	Will you give Mom a break?
L595954	u3216	m212	SAM	I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
L595953	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	This is kind of a cool place.
L595942	u3215	m212	MICHAEL	That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
L595941	u3216	m212	SAM	What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
L583651	u3243	m215	BECKER	Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
L583650	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	We never should have done this to him...
L583649	u3243	m215	BECKER	Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
L583518	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
L583517	u3243	m215	BECKER	Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
L583516	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Should we be...
L583515	u3243	m215	BECKER	What about Starks?
L583514	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	But... what about Starks?
L583513	u3243	m215	BECKER	Then don't.
L583512	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
L583511	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'm fine.
L583510	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	You ok?
L584055	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
L584054	u3243	m215	BECKER	I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
L584053	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
L584052	u3243	m215	BECKER	I don't understand...
L584051	u3252	m215	STARKS	You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
L584050	u3243	m215	BECKER	How did you come to know their names?
L584046	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, we were patients.
L584045	u3243	m215	BECKER	The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
L584044	u3252	m215	STARKS	So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
L584043	u3243	m215	BECKER	It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
L584042	u3252	m215	STARKS	Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
L584041	u3243	m215	BECKER	Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
L584040	u3243	m215	BECKER	Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
L584039	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L584038	u3243	m215	BECKER	I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
L584037	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
L584036	u3243	m215	BECKER	I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
L584035	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
L584034	u3243	m215	BECKER	No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
L584033	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
L584032	u3243	m215	BECKER	You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
L584031	u3243	m215	BECKER	How...how are you here?
L584030	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
L584029	u3243	m215	BECKER	[Beat] You're his son?
L584028	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
L584027	u3243	m215	BECKER	Who are you?
L583983	u3243	m215	BECKER	You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
L583982	u3252	m215	STARKS	Becker, how do you sleep at night?
L583981	u3243	m215	BECKER	Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
L583980	u3252	m215	STARKS	And what does that mean?
L583979	u3243	m215	BECKER	I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
L583978	u3252	m215	STARKS	You sure you know where to find one?
L583977	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
L583972	u3243	m215	BECKER	You killed him?
L583971	u3252	m215	STARKS	Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
L583970	u3243	m215	BECKER	Yes.
L583969	u3252	m215	STARKS	My business?
L583968	u3243	m215	BECKER	And what's that?
L583966	u3243	m215	BECKER	Temporarily.
L583965	u3252	m215	STARKS	They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
L583964	u3243	m215	BECKER	"It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our ""practices"" off to the New Year."
L583963	u3252	m215	STARKS	That's too bad.
L583962	u3243	m215	BECKER	Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
L583773	u3243	m215	BECKER	Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
L583772	u3252	m215	STARKS	Long live the Organization for the Organized!
L583696	u3243	m215	BECKER	Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
L583695	u3252	m215	STARKS	We are not birds of a feather.
L583692	u3243	m215	BECKER	I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
L583691	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't give a shit about your patient!
L583690	u3243	m215	BECKER	I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
L583689	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
L583688	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
L583687	u3243	m215	BECKER	You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
L583686	u3243	m215	BECKER	[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
L583685	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
L583684	u3243	m215	BECKER	Relax.
L583683	u3243	m215	BECKER	Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
L583682	u3252	m215	STARKS	That wasn't a fucking restraint.
L583681	u3243	m215	BECKER	We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
L583680	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
L583679	u3243	m215	BECKER	In where?
L583678	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
L583658	u3243	m215	BECKER	Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
L583657	u3252	m215	STARKS	Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
L583656	u3243	m215	BECKER	He's recovering on the third floor.
L583466	u3243	m215	BECKER	It's not my job to believe you.
L583465	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
L583464	u3243	m215	BECKER	You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
L583463	u3252	m215	STARKS	Depends on what you're seeing.
L583462	u3243	m215	BECKER	I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
L583461	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
L583460	u3243	m215	BECKER	Well, your condition's pretty serious.
L583890	u3244	m215	DAMON	I never touched your father! I swear!
L583889	u3252	m215	STARKS	He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
L583888	u3244	m215	DAMON	I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
L583887	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
L583886	u3244	m215	DAMON	I thought you said you never knew your father.
L583885	u3252	m215	STARKS	That's too bad.
L583884	u3244	m215	DAMON	Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
L583882	u3244	m215	DAMON	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
L583881	u3252	m215	STARKS	My father used to talk about you.
L583878	u3244	m215	DAMON	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
L583877	u3252	m215	STARKS	Did you know my father?
L583876	u3252	m215	STARKS	He didn't either.
L583875	u3244	m215	DAMON	That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
L583874	u3252	m215	STARKS	You may have known my father, William Starks.
L583873	u3244	m215	DAMON	Do I know you from somewhere?
L583749	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
L583748	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
L583747	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	They should just be looking harder.
L583746	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What should they be looking for?
L583745	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
L583744	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
L583743	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	Maybe it's not such a waste.
L583742	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
L583741	u3245	m215	DR. GRIES	We're late.
L584139	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
L584138	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	No, it hasn't.
L584137	u3252	m215	STARKS	And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
L584136	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	I can't take you out of here in your condition...
L584135	u3252	m215	STARKS	I need to get this letter to someone.
L584134	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Thank you.
L584133	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
L584132	u3252	m215	STARKS	This is really happening, isn't it?
L583499	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good.
L583498	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	Sure.
L583497	u3252	m215	STARKS	You done with your small talk?
L583496	u3252	m215	STARKS	I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
L583495	u3246	m215	DR. LORENSON	You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
L583814	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
L583813	u3252	m215	STARKS	What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
L583812	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
L583811	u3252	m215	STARKS	What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
L583810	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
L583809	u3252	m215	STARKS	His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
L583808	u3247	m215	DR. MORGAN	I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
L584162	u3249	m215	JEAN	Just do it.
L584161	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Why?
L584160	u3249	m215	JEAN	Jackie, go play in the snow.
L584157	u3249	m215	JEAN	Oh, yeah.
L584156	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
L584155	u3249	m215	JEAN	I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
L583430	u3249	m215	JEAN	Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
L583429	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Mom, he just fixed our car.
L583428	u3249	m215	JEAN	Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
L584194	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm doing fine.
L584193	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How you doin'?
L584185	u3252	m215	STARKS	I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
L584184	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
L584183	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You're bleeding pretty bad there.
L584182	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think so.
L584171	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok.
L584170	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
L584150	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok, I guess.
L584149	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good. How's your mom?
L584148	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I've been ok.
L584089	u3252	m215	STARKS	Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
L584088	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Then, where are you going?
L584087	u3252	m215	STARKS	You gotta stop thinking like that.
L584086	u3248	m215	JACKIE	112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
L584085	u3252	m215	STARKS	When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
L584084	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What?
L584071	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Ok. Ssh. Rest.
L584070	u3252	m215	STARKS	Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
L584068	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
L584067	u3252	m215	STARKS	What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
L584065	u3248	m215	JACKIE	To the hospital.
L584064	u3252	m215	STARKS	Where are we going?
L584063	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
L584062	u3252	m215	STARKS	If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
L584059	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
L584058	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, he didn't.
L584057	u3248	m215	JACKIE	That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
L584023	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
L584022	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William, you're not making sense.
L584021	u3252	m215	STARKS	They've got lives to be grateful for.
L584018	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's Sunday.
L584017	u3252	m215	STARKS	Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
L584013	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat] I don't know.
L584012	u3252	m215	STARKS	Then why isn't there anyone around?
L584011	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
L584010	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
L584008	u3252	m215	STARKS	There're no cars on this street.
L584007	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? What are you thinking?
L584004	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat, lost] No.
L584003	u3252	m215	STARKS	They're not.
L584002	u3248	m215	JACKIE	They're not here.
L584001	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
L584000	u3252	m215	STARKS	You're sure?
L583999	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
L583998	u3252	m215	STARKS	Me, too.
L583901	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
L583900	u3252	m215	STARKS	I might not be able to.
L583899	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
L583898	u3252	m215	STARKS	Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
L583897	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
L583896	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
L583894	u3248	m215	JACKIE	They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
L583893	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know.
L583892	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How long do we have?
L583865	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
L583864	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583863	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
L583862	u3252	m215	STARKS	Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
L583861	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You think Lorenson kills you?
L583860	u3252	m215	STARKS	I have no idea.
L583859	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
L583858	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't believe a thing she just said.
L583807	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
L583806	u3252	m215	STARKS	How? Did they figure it out after I died?
L583805	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I know.
L583804	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
L583803	u3252	m215	STARKS	If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
L583802	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
L583801	u3252	m215	STARKS	I know.
L583800	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
L583799	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yes.
L583798	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
L583797	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
L583796	u3252	m215	STARKS	Do you really believe me?
L583795	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
L583794	u3252	m215	STARKS	What?
L583793	u3248	m215	JACKIE	[Beat] You bled to death.
L583792	u3252	m215	STARKS	After I...
L583791	u3248	m215	JACKIE	But no one knew until after...
L583790	u3248	m215	JACKIE	It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
L583789	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah.
L583788	u3248	m215	JACKIE	The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
L583640	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Please...
L583639	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
L583638	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
L583637	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
L583636	u3252	m215	STARKS	It's December 25th, 1993 today.
L583635	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
L583634	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
L583633	u3252	m215	STARKS	How'd he die?
L583632	u3248	m215	JACKIE	No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
L583631	u3252	m215	STARKS	I gave you my dog tags.
L583630	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L583629	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I looked it up.
L583628	u3248	m215	JACKIE	His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
L583627	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What?
L583626	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
L583625	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What?
L583624	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
L583623	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
L583622	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
L583621	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Well, you belong in one.
L583620	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
L583619	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
L583618	u3252	m215	STARKS	Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
L583617	u3248	m215	JACKIE	If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
L583616	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
L583615	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
L583441	u3248	m215	JACKIE	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
L583440	u3252	m215	STARKS	I think I can remember what's on them.
L583439	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
L583438	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What for?
L583437	u3252	m215	STARKS	Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
L583436	u3248	m215	JACKIE	What're those?
L583435	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
L583434	u3248	m215	JACKIE	You're just gonna walk?
L583426	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah.
L583425	u3252	m215	STARKS	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
L583424	u3248	m215	JACKIE	But I like it I guess.
L583420	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Jackie.
L583419	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] What's your name?
L583418	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Yeah, but I don't know what.
L583417	u3252	m215	STARKS	Your mom take anything before this happened?
L583415	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Our car won't start.
L583414	u3252	m215	STARKS	You two ok?
L583413	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
L583851	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
L583850	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
L583838	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I still don't either, even after all these years.
L583837	u3248	m215	JACKIE	I don't understand.
L583836	u3250	m215	LORENSON	He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
L583835	u3248	m215	JACKIE	How?
L583834	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
L583833	u3248	m215	JACKIE	Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
L584142	u3252	m215	STARKS	Good.
L584141	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
L584140	u3252	m215	STARKS	You know how to get there?
L584120	u3252	m215	STARKS	You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
L584119	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What are you talking about?
L584118	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
L584117	u3252	m215	STARKS	You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
L584116	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Who told you this?
L584115	u3252	m215	STARKS	"He's having absence [pronounced ""absance""] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly."
L584114	u3252	m215	STARKS	Listen to me. That's all I ask.
L584113	u3250	m215	LORENSON	William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
L584111	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
L584110	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I do believe you...
L584109	u3252	m215	STARKS	You still don't believe me, do you?
L584108	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I'm not gonna let that happen.
L584107	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What for?
L584106	u3252	m215	STARKS	Can I get some paper and something to write with.
L584105	u3252	m215	STARKS	Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
L584104	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
L584097	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You have nothing to fear, William.
L584096	u3252	m215	STARKS	Who...who kills me?
L584095	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Yeah.
L584094	u3252	m215	STARKS	I did?
L584093	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You told me this was how it happened.
L584092	u3252	m215	STARKS	How...how do you know?
L584091	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
L583946	u3252	m215	STARKS	NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
L583945	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
L583944	u3252	m215	STARKS	Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
L583942	u3252	m215	STARKS	You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
L583941	u3250	m215	LORENSON	How do you know about Eugene?
L583939	u3250	m215	LORENSON	William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
L583938	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
L583937	u3250	m215	LORENSON	And how do you know that?
L583936	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
L583935	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Why not?
L583934	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because I don't have time.
L583933	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Why don't you help me?
L583931	u3252	m215	STARKS	Maybe.
L583930	u3250	m215	LORENSON	[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
L583927	u3252	m215	STARKS	I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
L583926	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What about the world?
L583925	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
L583924	u3250	m215	LORENSON	The future doesn't look different?
L583923	u3252	m215	STARKS	It doesn't look all that different.
L583922	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
L583920	u3252	m215	STARKS	2004.
L583919	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Well, what time is it?
L583918	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
L583917	u3252	m215	STARKS	Come on. Tell me what you do know.
L583916	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
L583913	u3252	m215	STARKS	This has nothing to do with that.
L583912	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
L583911	u3252	m215	STARKS	You don't understand.
L583909	u3252	m215	STARKS	Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
L583908	u3250	m215	LORENSON	No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
L583907	u3252	m215	STARKS	You have no idea what's going on.
L583906	u3250	m215	LORENSON	What do you mean?
L583903	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll die either way.
L583902	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
L583857	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] We will.
L583856	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
L583855	u3252	m215	STARKS	Exactly.
L583854	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, it is.
L583853	u3250	m215	LORENSON	It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
L583849	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why would we do that?
L583848	u3250	m215	LORENSON	So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
L583846	u3252	m215	STARKS	My dad wrote some things down before he died.
L583845	u3250	m215	LORENSON	How do you know about Dr. Becker?
L583844	u3252	m215	STARKS	Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
L583843	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
L583842	u3252	m215	STARKS	But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
L583841	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I don't know.
L583840	u3252	m215	STARKS	How'd he get it?
L583831	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I was working with a boy named Eugene.
L583830	u3252	m215	STARKS	What case?
L583828	u3252	m215	STARKS	You thought my father was crazy?
L583827	u3250	m215	LORENSON	At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
L583826	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583825	u3250	m215	LORENSON	Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
L583824	u3252	m215	STARKS	I never knew my father. Did you?
L583823	u3250	m215	LORENSON	My God you look exactly like him.
L583720	u3252	m215	STARKS	Believe me, I know.
L583719	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
L583718	u3250	m215	LORENSON	So it's helping?
L583717	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. I don't want it to.
L583716	u3252	m215	STARKS	I could try to...make it stop.
L583715	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why, what would you do?
L583711	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
L583710	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
L583709	u3252	m215	STARKS	That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
L583708	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You were convicted of the crime.
L583706	u3250	m215	LORENSON	You're not crazy.
L583705	u3252	m215	STARKS	Because I don't think I'm crazy.
L583704	u3250	m215	LORENSON	I guess I'd ask you why.
L583703	u3252	m215	STARKS	And if I didn't want to come?
L583959	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
L583958	u3252	m215	STARKS	Becker does? Are you sure?
L583957	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
L583956	u3252	m215	STARKS	MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
L583952	u3252	m215	STARKS	Is it true?
L583951	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	"Geez, how's that for a fucking ""thank you""?"
L583740	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
L583739	u3252	m215	STARKS	So what am I supposed to do?
L583738	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
L583737	u3252	m215	STARKS	Why?
L583736	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	It's gonna be sticky.
L583732	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
L583731	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
L583730	u3252	m215	STARKS	The Jacket.
L583729	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	[Beat] How do you know?
L583728	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
L583727	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
L583726	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
L583725	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I know you need one when it's really cold.
L583723	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
L583722	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I wasn't talking about anything.
L583721	u3252	m215	STARKS	What were you talking about the other day?
L583484	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
L583483	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
L583481	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
L583480	u3252	m215	STARKS	Don't you go to jail for that?
L583479	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	I tried to kill my wife.
L583477	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	"TV. Helps numb [makes a ""crazy gesture""] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie."
L583476	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
L583475	u3251	m215	MACKENZIE	That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
L584079	u3253	m215	TENNY	Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
L584078	u3252	m215	STARKS	Sure.
L584077	u3253	m215	TENNY	Can you drive?
L584076	u3253	m215	TENNY	I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
L584075	u3252	m215	STARKS	Where are you going?
L584074	u3253	m215	TENNY	Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
L583779	u3252	m215	STARKS	I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
L583778	u3253	m215	TENNY	It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
L583777	u3252	m215	STARKS	No.
L583776	u3253	m215	TENNY	You ever been to jail?
L583608	u3252	m215	STARKS	That when you stopped being a nurse?
L583607	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
L583606	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm sorry.
L583605	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
L583604	u3252	m215	STARKS	How?
L583603	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
L583602	u3252	m215	STARKS	Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
L583601	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	I'm sorry.
L583600	u3252	m215	STARKS	I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
L583599	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	So you never knew your mother?
L583598	u3252	m215	STARKS	They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
L583597	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
L583596	u3252	m215	STARKS	But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
L583595	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You remember it?
L583594	u3252	m215	STARKS	This is a great song.
L583591	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
L583590	u3252	m215	STARKS	You don't think that's crazy?
L583589	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	[Beat] Real is overrated.
L583588	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Why?
L583587	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, good for you.
L583585	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't know, but I think part of it's...
L583584	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
L583583	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Why'd you stop?
L583582	u3252	m215	STARKS	Have you always been a waitress?
L583581	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	[Beat] I do it.
L583580	u3252	m215	STARKS	You like it?
L583579	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Yup. That's me.
L583578	u3252	m215	STARKS	So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
L583577	u3252	m215	STARKS	Thanks.
L583576	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	This is pretty good. Considering...
L583575	u3252	m215	STARKS	Sure.
L583574	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You want a drink?
L583573	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
L583572	u3252	m215	STARKS	I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
L583571	u3252	m215	STARKS	The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
L583570	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	What's this?
L583567	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
L583566	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
L583564	u3252	m215	STARKS	No, I'm ok.
L583563	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
L583562	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'll manage.
L583561	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
L583560	u3252	m215	STARKS	Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
L583559	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
L583557	u3252	m215	STARKS	No. [Beat] Not around here.
L583556	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
L583555	u3252	m215	STARKS	No.
L583554	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Do you have a motel or something? Money?
L583553	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I was dropped off.
L583552	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, how'd you get here?
L583548	u3252	m215	STARKS	Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
L583547	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
L583546	u3252	m215	STARKS	"Why ""of course""?"
L583545	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Of course you don't know.
L583544	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
L583543	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Well, where are you from?
L583542	u3252	m215	STARKS	I don't think so.
L583541	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	You don't have anywhere to stay?
L583540	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure.
L583536	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
L583535	u3252	m215	STARKS	I'm not sure.
L583534	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
L583533	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] Thanks.
L583532	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
L583530	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	Good.
L583529	u3252	m215	STARKS	[Beat] I'm not deaf.
L583528	u3254	m215	WAITRESS	If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
L646629	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like weird calls, by any chance?
L646628	u3439	m227	BOB	I don't follow.
L646627	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
L646626	u3439	m227	BOB	I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
L646625	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
L646624	u3439	m227	BOB	We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
L646623	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes, but...
L646622	u3439	m227	BOB	I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
L646621	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What?
L646620	u3439	m227	BOB	Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
L646618	u3439	m227	BOB	I'm sure we can match any offer.
L646617	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And I...I've got other things happening.
L646616	u3439	m227	BOB	Come on.  Kids love horror.
L646615	u3443	m227	HEATHER	So I don't know about horror.
L646614	u3439	m227	BOB	So?
L646613	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
L646612	u3439	m227	BOB	Sort of a trial balloon.
L646611	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You mean that was a...
L646610	u3439	m227	BOB	He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
L646609	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Can I read it?
L646608	u3439	m227	BOB	He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
L646607	u3443	m227	HEATHER	The nightmares.
L646606	u3439	m227	BOB	He's very excited about it.
L646605	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Which means he's having nightmares again?
L646604	u3439	m227	BOB	Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
L646603	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
L646602	u3439	m227	BOB	We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
L646601	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
L646659	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
L646658	u3440	m227	CHASE	I'll be there in three hours.
L646657	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.
L646656	u3440	m227	CHASE	Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
L646655	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
L646654	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather, has there been another call?
L646653	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like Freddy.
L646652	u3440	m227	CHASE	Like what?
L646651	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
L646650	u3440	m227	CHASE	What?  What kind of episode?
L646649	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He's had some sort of...episode.
L646647	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase, it's Dylan!
L646646	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
L646645	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase, you'd better come home.
L646644	u3440	m227	CHASE	What's up?
L646643	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase. Hi...
L646642	u3440	m227	CHASE	Heather?
L646505	u3440	m227	CHASE	48 hours.  Back before you know it.
L646504	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Guess so.
L646503	u3440	m227	CHASE	I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
L646502	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Just be careful, okay?
L646501	u3440	m227	CHASE	You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
L646500	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
L646499	u3440	m227	CHASE	Maybe you should tell me your dream.
L646498	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What if it isn't over?
L646497	u3440	m227	CHASE	Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
L646496	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, you don't.
L646495	u3440	m227	CHASE	You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
L646494	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
L646491	u3440	m227	CHASE	Hasn't been another call, has there?
L646490	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
L646489	u3440	m227	CHASE	Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
L646486	u3443	m227	HEATHER	More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
L646485	u3440	m227	CHASE	You get any sleep last night?
L646484	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
L646481	u3440	m227	CHASE	I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
L646480	u3443	m227	HEATHER	One of mom's cups got broken.
L646475	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No biggie, really.
L646474	u3440	m227	CHASE	Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
L646460	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Chase...
L646459	u3440	m227	CHASE	Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
L646950	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
L646949	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	What?
L646948	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
L646947	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
L646942	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
L646941	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
L646940	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want my kid out of here now!
L646920	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
L646919	u3443	m227	HEATHER	DO you mind...
L646897	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Everything is not fine!
L646896	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
L646895	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He was just here!
L646894	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
L646884	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
L646883	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Doctor...
L646875	u3443	m227	HEATHER	They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
L646874	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	These look quite fresh.
L646873	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
L646872	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
L646868	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Oh my God...
L646867	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
L646866	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Is he all right?
L646865	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
L646808	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
L646807	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like what?
L646806	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Absolutely.
L646805	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Does he have to stay here over night?
L646801	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No...
L646800	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
L646799	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.
L646798	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Diabetes?
L646797	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.
L646796	u3441	m227	DR. HEFNER	Any history of epilepsy in your family?
L647002	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Read me some?
L647001	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
L647000	u3442	m227	DYLAN	A story?
L646999	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What...what is that?
L646998	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Here.
L646997	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, where's the man?
L646972	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Coming for you...
L646971	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
L646916	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
L646915	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
L646913	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
L646912	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Right 'cross the freeway.
L646911	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
L646909	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
L646908	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
L646907	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You okay, champ?
L646814	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Home, that's right.
L646813	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Home.
L646744	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Can you come with me in my dreams?
L646743	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
L646742	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Why does God let there be bad things?
L646741	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
L646740	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Do you have to die to see God?
L646736	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
L646735	u3443	m227	HEATHER	And...what's the man doing?
L646734	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
L646733	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Your bed?
L646732	u3442	m227	DYLAN	In my bed.
L646727	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
L646726	u3442	m227	DYLAN	I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
L646691	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Not sleepy.
L646690	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
L646689	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
L646688	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
L646683	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Right.
L646682	u3442	m227	DYLAN	He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
L646681	u3443	m227	HEATHER	He's on his way.
L646680	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Don't let the bedbugs bite.
L646679	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
L646676	u3442	m227	DYLAN	The mean old man with the claws.
L646675	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Who?
L646673	u3443	m227	HEATHER	They were safe and could sleep.
L646672	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe.
L646670	u3442	m227	DYLAN	No.  Tonight.  It's important!
L646669	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Tomorrow night.
L646668	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Say how they find their way back home.
L646667	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Time for sleep.
L646664	u3442	m227	DYLAN	I like this story.
L646663	u3443	m227	HEATHER	This is going to give you nightmares.
L646662	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Finish, please!
L646661	u3443	m227	HEATHER	...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside.  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
L646638	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Rex?  Who's Rex?
L646637	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Rex saved me.
L646550	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Bye.
L646549	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
L646511	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What?
L646510	u3442	m227	DYLAN	Someone's coming.
L646488	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
L646487	u3442	m227	DYLAN	You going away?
L646473	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You have a fever, sweetie?
L646472	u3442	m227	DYLAN	no.
L646784	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
L646783	u3443	m227	HEATHER	When do you think it'll be done?
L646782	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
L646781	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
L646780	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Call it a guess...
L646779	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yeah...how'd you know?
L646778	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Darker.  More...evil?
L646775	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
L646774	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
L646773	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
L646772	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Heather?  You doing okay?
L646577	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
L646576	u3443	m227	HEATHER	In what, a romantic comedy?
L646574	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
L646573	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
L646572	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I'm fine.
L646571	u3449	m227	ROBERT ENGLUND	You okay?
L646970	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Yeah, sure.
L646969	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Fred Krueger did it.
L646968	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	What are you talking about?
L646967	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know how Chase really died.
L646963	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
L646962	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Holy...
L646956	u3443	m227	HEATHER	John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
L646955	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You're right.  That sounds crazy!
L646954	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
L646953	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You got it.  What's happening?
L646952	u3443	m227	HEATHER	John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
L646951	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
L646766	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You really think Dylan's okay?
L646765	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
L646764	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Really?
L646763	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
L646762	u3443	m227	HEATHER	A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
L646761	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Steady...
L646760	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Freddy, for all I know.
L646759	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
L646758	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I've never mentioned it to him.
L646757	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
L646756	u3443	m227	HEATHER	It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
L646755	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Seemed, not was.
L646754	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
L646753	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You didn't jump in.
L646752	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
L646751	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	You're not crazy, by the way.
L646747	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
L646746	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
L646722	u3446	m227	JOHN SAXON	Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
L646721	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What...happened?
L646706	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want to see for myself.
L646705	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
L646704	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I want to see the body.
L646697	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
L646696	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes.
L646695	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	Is Chase Porter your husband?
L646694	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes?
L646693	u3444	m227	HIGHWAY PATROLMAN #1	Heather Langenkamp?
L646532	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I just can't.
L646531	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	Listen, dammit.
L646530	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I'm sorry, I can't.
L646529	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	You're kidding, right?
L646528	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
L646527	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	The car's no there yet?
L646526	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
L646525	u3448	m227	MAN'S VOICE	Studio B.
L646864	u3447	m227	JULIE	They wouldn't let me...
L646863	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
L646641	u3447	m227	JULIE	Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
L646640	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
L646553	u3447	m227	JULIE	'S okay.
L646552	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
L646551	u3447	m227	JULIE	I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
L646522	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
L646521	u3447	m227	JULIE	Heather, what is it?
L646515	u3447	m227	JULIE	Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
L646514	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
L646855	u3451	m227	WES	Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
L646854	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Choice?  What kind of choice?
L646853	u3451	m227	WES	The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
L646852	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
L646851	u3451	m227	WES	Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
L646850	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
L646849	u3451	m227	WES	But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
L646848	u3443	m227	HEATHER	That was Nancy, not me!
L646847	u3451	m227	WES	Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
L646846	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Me?  Why me?
L646845	u3451	m227	WES	Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
L646844	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
L646843	u3451	m227	WES	Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
L646842	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Then what is he doing?
L646841	u3451	m227	WES	That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
L646840	u3443	m227	HEATHER	If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
L646839	u3451	m227	WES	Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
L646838	u3443	m227	HEATHER	You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
L646837	u3451	m227	WES	Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
L646836	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Like the Genie in the bottle.
L646835	u3451	m227	WES	By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
L646834	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Captured?  How?
L646833	u3451	m227	WES	It can be captured, sometimes.
L646832	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
L646831	u3451	m227	WES	I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
L646830	u3443	m227	HEATHER	This is still a script we're talking about, right?
L646829	u3451	m227	WES	Killing innocence, one way or the other.
L646828	u3443	m227	HEATHER	What's that?
L646827	u3451	m227	WES	I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
L646569	u3445	m227	HOST	Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
L646568	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Robert?  I...
L646567	u3445	m227	HOST	And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
L646566	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
L646564	u3443	m227	HEATHER	My child?  No...but...
L646563	u3445	m227	HOST	Do you let your child watch your movies?
L646562	u3443	m227	HEATHER	No, not really.  I...
L646561	u3445	m227	HOST	Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
L646560	u3443	m227	HEATHER	I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
L646597	u3450	m227	SARA	Me too.
L646596	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Black's fine.
L646595	u3450	m227	SARA	Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
L646594	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Coffee'd be nice.
L646593	u3450	m227	SARA	Can I get you something to drink?
L646586	u3450	m227	SARA	Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
L646585	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Now?
L646584	u3450	m227	SARA	No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
L646583	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Uh...sure...when?
L646582	u3450	m227	SARA	Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
L646581	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
L646580	u3450	m227	SARA	Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
L646579	u3443	m227	HEATHER	Yes?
L69988	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"Right.  Sure.  And ""Peace on earth, good will toward men."""
L69987	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
L69986	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Yes, I suppose that we did.
L69985	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I guess this mean we won.
L69860	u3912	m259	BRUCE	You'll never guess.
L69859	u3910	m259	ALFRED	"Ah.  ""Who"", may I ask, are you going ""as""?"
L69858	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
L69857	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
L69839	u3910	m259	ALFRED	I think I'll take the stairs.
L69838	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Affair ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
L69837	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
L69781	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Alright, thanks.
L69780	u3910	m259	ALFRED	I will relay the message.
L69779	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb ""Be my girlfriend way,"" but --"
L69778	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
L69777	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
L69517	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No, actually I feel worse.
L69516	u3910	m259	ALFRED	I suppose you feel better now, sir.
L69508	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
L69507	u3910	m259	ALFRED	It's vichyssoise, sir.
L69506	u3912	m259	BRUCE	It's cold.
L69479	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
L69478	u3910	m259	ALFRED	Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
L69958	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Wrong on both counts.
L69957	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
L69956	u3911	m259	BATMAN	First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
L69809	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
L69808	u3911	m259	BATMAN	I tried to grab you -- save you --
L69807	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
L69806	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
L69805	u3911	m259	BATMAN	A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
L69794	u3911	m259	BATMAN	We do.
L69793	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
L69673	u3911	m259	BATMAN	...four, five.
L69672	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
L69671	u3911	m259	BATMAN	I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
L69670	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	"Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on ""them"" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?"
L69669	u3911	m259	BATMAN	"A ""he-man""?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of."
L69667	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
L69666	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Hanging on every word.
L69665	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
L69664	u3911	m259	BATMAN	I'm -- sorry, I --
L69663	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	How could you?  I'm a woman...
L69662	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Shreck's.  You --
L69661	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Where's the fire?
L69944	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Maybe you're right.
L69943	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
L69658	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Things change.
L69657	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
L69656	u3911	m259	BATMAN	What're you really after?
L69655	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Better than you know, Bat-boy.
L69654	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
L69653	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
L69652	u3911	m259	BATMAN	You're not the Mayor.
L69651	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
L69650	u3911	m259	BATMAN	Admiring your handiwork?
L69893	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
L69892	u3918	m259	SELINA	... What do we do?
L69888	u3912	m259	BRUCE	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
L69887	u3918	m259	SELINA	A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
L69886	u3918	m259	SELINA	I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
L69885	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
L69884	u3918	m259	SELINA	Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
L69879	u3918	m259	SELINA	You first.
L69878	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
L69877	u3918	m259	SELINA	Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
L69876	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Y'mean take off our costumes?
L69875	u3918	m259	SELINA	There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
L69873	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No hard feelings?
L69872	u3918	m259	SELINA	'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
L69871	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
L69772	u3912	m259	BRUCE	What're you doing three dates from now?
L69771	u3918	m259	SELINA	Nor I, on the second.
L69770	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
L69769	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
L69768	u3918	m259	SELINA	"It's the so-called ""normal"" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited."
L69767	u3912	m259	BRUCE	If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
L69766	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Well?  Was ""Vicki"" right?  About your difficulty with duality?"
L69765	u3918	m259	SELINA	Sure.
L69764	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Photojournalist.
L69763	u3918	m259	SELINA	Vicki.  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
L69762	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
L69761	u3918	m259	SELINA	And the truth frightened her?
L69760	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Nope, I told her everything.
L69759	u3918	m259	SELINA	What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
L69758	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Had one.  Didn't work.
L69757	u3918	m259	SELINA	Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
L69756	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
L69755	u3918	m259	SELINA	I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
L69748	u3918	m259	SELINA	Yes and no...
L69747	u3912	m259	BRUCE	... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
L69746	u3918	m259	SELINA	We?  You and...
L69745	u3912	m259	BRUCE	... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
L69744	u3918	m259	SELINA	Yeah?  Me too...
L69743	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
L69742	u3918	m259	SELINA	No darker than yours, Bruce.
L69741	u3912	m259	BRUCE	You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
L69740	u3918	m259	SELINA	I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
L69739	u3912	m259	BRUCE	You almost sound enthusiastic.
L69738	u3918	m259	SELINA	-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
L69737	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
L69736	u3918	m259	SELINA	"You're not coming to that, are you?  ""The Relighting of the Tree"" thing?"
L69735	u3918	m259	SELINA	"I heard on TV, ""Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds.""  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?"
L69734	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"And it's not even accurate ... I mean, ""Batman Blows It""?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage."
L69733	u3918	m259	SELINA	The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
L69731	u3918	m259	SELINA	Treat to be here.
L69730	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
L69729	u3918	m259	SELINA	Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
L69728	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
L69586	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Oh.  ""Kyle."""
L69585	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
L69584	u3918	m259	SELINA	Pouring myself into my work.
L69580	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I'm tempted.
L69579	u3918	m259	SELINA	I'm listed.
L69578	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Well, I could ... free up some time...
L69577	u3918	m259	SELINA	Well that's a ... long story ...
L69576	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
L69575	u3918	m259	SELINA	You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
L69570	u3918	m259	SELINA	Yes and no ...
L69569	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Didn't I say that?
L69568	u3918	m259	SELINA	You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
L69567	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
L69566	u3918	m259	SELINA	Have we?
L69565	u3912	m259	BRUCE	We've met.
L69869	u3916	m259	MAX	Yawn.
L69868	u3912	m259	BRUCE	It does to me.
L69867	u3916	m259	MAX	"I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the ""mayor""?"
L69866	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
L69865	u3916	m259	MAX	Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
L69572	u3916	m259	MAX	Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
L69571	u3912	m259	BRUCE	What happened?
L69559	u3916	m259	MAX	Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
L69558	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Oswald is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
L69557	u3916	m259	MAX	Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
L69556	u3912	m259	BRUCE	"Not compared to that ""Cobblepot"" person you're promoting..."
L69555	u3912	m259	BRUCE	I'm not scared of you, Max.
L69554	u3916	m259	MAX	Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
L69553	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
L69552	u3916	m259	MAX	If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
L69547	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
L69546	u3916	m259	MAX	I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
L69545	u3916	m259	MAX	Weird, huh?
L69544	u3912	m259	BRUCE	No.  No glass on the inside.
L69543	u3916	m259	MAX	Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
L69542	u3912	m259	BRUCE	Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
L69967	u3916	m259	MAX	One way to find out?
L69966	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
L69965	u3916	m259	MAX	Was.
L69964	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
L69963	u3916	m259	MAX	Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
L69954	u3916	m259	MAX	Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
L69953	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
L69952	u3916	m259	MAX	Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
L69951	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
L69950	u3916	m259	MAX	My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
L69949	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Your blood, Max.
L69948	u3916	m259	MAX	I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
L69818	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
L69817	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
L69816	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
L69815	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
L69814	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
L69813	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Let's consummate our fiendish union!
L69721	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
L69720	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
L69719	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
L69718	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
L69717	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
L69711	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
L69710	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Y'mean frame him?
L69709	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
L69708	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
L69707	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
L69706	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
L69705	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
L69703	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
L69702	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
L69701	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
L69700	u3913	m259	CATWOMAN	Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
L69699	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
L69589	u3916	m259	MAX	Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
L69588	u3914	m259	CHIP	"You buy this ""blurry"" business?"
L69539	u3914	m259	CHIP	PMS.
L69538	u3916	m259	MAX	Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
L69537	u3914	m259	CHIP	She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
L69536	u3916	m259	MAX	I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
L69417	u3914	m259	CHIP	Dad!  Save yourself!
L69416	u3916	m259	MAX	Son!
L69941	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	My lips are sealed.
L69940	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	But who could've ... no, don't say it.
L69939	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
L69935	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	All is shrill, all is blight...
L69934	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Silent night, violent night...
L69933	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	... eight, seven...
L69932	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
L69931	u3915	m259	FAT CLOWN	Ten, nine...
L69907	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
L69906	u3916	m259	MAX	I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
L69905	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I don't.  So, no.
L69904	u3916	m259	MAX	Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
L69903	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
L69847	u3916	m259	MAX	I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
L69846	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
L69831	u3916	m259	MAX	Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
L69830	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
L69633	u3916	m259	MAX	Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
L69632	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
L69631	u3916	m259	MAX	Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
L69630	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
L69629	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
L69628	u3916	m259	MAX	Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
L69626	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot.  ""Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.""  ""I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"""
L69625	u3916	m259	MAX	That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
L69624	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
L69623	u3916	m259	MAX	Oswald:  We need one more thing.
L69622	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	"I could teach her my ""French flipper"" trick..."
L69621	u3916	m259	MAX	We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
L69620	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Wonder if it's worth my time.
L69610	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
L69609	u3916	m259	MAX	Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
L69608	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
L69606	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
L69605	u3916	m259	MAX	Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
L69469	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
L69468	u3916	m259	MAX	You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
L69466	u3916	m259	MAX	Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
L69465	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
L69464	u3916	m259	MAX	If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
L69463	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
L69462	u3916	m259	MAX	Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
L69460	u3916	m259	MAX	And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
L69459	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	"Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my ""human"" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted."
L69455	u3916	m259	MAX	Well it's not working.
L69454	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	No, just give you a splitting headache.
L69453	u3916	m259	MAX	"What, is that supposed to ""hypnotize"" me?"
L69449	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
L69448	u3916	m259	MAX	My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
L69447	u3917	m259	PENGUIN	Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
L69685	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Actually I have to split.  Take a ""personal day.""  You don't mind? Max, you're tops."
L69684	u3916	m259	MAX	I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
L69683	u3918	m259	SELINA	Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
L69564	u3916	m259	MAX	Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
L69563	u3918	m259	SELINA	That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
L69562	u3916	m259	MAX	Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
L69533	u3916	m259	MAX	Actually, it's a lot like that.
L69532	u3918	m259	SELINA	Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
L69531	u3916	m259	MAX	I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
L69530	u3918	m259	SELINA	It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
L69529	u3918	m259	SELINA	Too good?
L69528	u3916	m259	MAX	And a very, very good one.
L69527	u3918	m259	SELINA	I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
L69526	u3916	m259	MAX	... Where did curiosity get the cat?
L69524	u3916	m259	MAX	And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
L69523	u3918	m259	SELINA	Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
L69522	u3918	m259	SELINA	"Well I figured that your password was ""Finster.""  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant..."
L69521	u3916	m259	MAX	Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
L69520	u3918	m259	SELINA	No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
L69519	u3916	m259	MAX	Working late?  I'm touched.
L73949	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Tonight's a good night.
L73948	u3932	m261	ALFRED	All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
L73947	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
L73946	u3932	m261	ALFRED	What now sir?
L73944	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
L73943	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Enigma.
L73942	u3934	m261	BRUCE	And another name for Mystery?
L73941	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Mystery.
L73940	u3934	m261	BRUCE	How about, MR. E.
L73939	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
L73938	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Letters in the alphabet.
L73937	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
L73936	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Recognition, of course.
L73935	u3934	m261	BRUCE	What do maniacs always want?
L73934	u3932	m261	ALFRED	But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
L73933	u3934	m261	BRUCE	All the answers are numbers.
L73932	u3934	m261	BRUCE	...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
L73931	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Master, Bruce?
L73922	u3932	m261	ALFRED	No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
L73921	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
L73920	u3932	m261	ALFRED	What?
L73919	u3934	m261	BRUCE	...A bat.
L73918	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
L73917	u3934	m261	BRUCE	...Afraid.
L73916	u3932	m261	ALFRED	What?
L73915	u3934	m261	BRUCE	There's one other thing. I feel..
L73914	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Perhaps the fall...
L73913	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
L73908	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
L73907	u3934	m261	BRUCE	As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
L73906	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
L73905	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
L73904	u3932	m261	ALFRED	How are you feeling, young man?
L73836	u3934	m261	BRUCE	How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
L73835	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
L73834	u3934	m261	BRUCE	She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
L73833	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Dr. Meridian...
L73832	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
L73831	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Why, indeed?
L73830	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Why do I keep doing this?
L73829	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
L73828	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Which `they' might that be, sir?
L73827	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Maybe they're right.
L73768	u3932	m261	ALFRED	I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
L73767	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
L73743	u3932	m261	ALFRED	_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
L73742	u3934	m261	BRUCE	The _Rolls_?
L73741	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
L73740	u3934	m261	BRUCE	He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
L73739	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Actually, he took the car.
L73738	u3934	m261	BRUCE	He ran away?
L73737	u3932	m261	ALFRED	I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
L73736	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Is he all right?
L73735	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
L73621	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Don't be ridiculous.
L73620	u3932	m261	ALFRED	No. You said I. I killed them.
L73619	u3934	m261	BRUCE	He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
L73618	u3932	m261	ALFRED	What did you say?
L73617	u3934	m261	BRUCE	It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
L73604	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
L73603	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Ninety-three, including the sauna.
L73602	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
L73508	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
L73507	u3932	m261	ALFRED	I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
L73506	u3934	m261	BRUCE	...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
L73505	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
L73504	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
L73502	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Apology hastily retracted.
L73501	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I wonder if she'd go out with me.
L73500	u3932	m261	ALFRED	If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
L73499	u3934	m261	BRUCE	She has an excellent mind.
L73498	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Scholarly research?
L73497	u3932	m261	ALFRED	I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
L73496	u3934	m261	BRUCE	It'll never work.
L73495	u3932	m261	ALFRED	A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
L73494	u3934	m261	BRUCE	How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
L73457	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Hardly a worry, sir.
L73456	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
L73455	u3932	m261	ALFRED	...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
L73452	u3932	m261	ALFRED	It's a wonder you sleep at all.
L73451	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I think they're getting worse.
L73450	u3932	m261	ALFRED	The dreams again, sir?
L73709	u3936	m261	DICK	Four seconds from...
L73708	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Just checking, young sir.
L73707	u3936	m261	DICK	Up here, Al.
L73682	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Master Wayne's dead wives.
L73681	u3936	m261	DICK	How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
L73680	u3932	m261	ALFRED	May I help you, Master Grayson?
L73601	u3936	m261	DICK	Big house. How many rooms?
L73600	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Al?
L73599	u3936	m261	DICK	How ya doin', Al?
L73598	u3932	m261	ALFRED	Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
L74010	u3935	m261	CHASE	Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
L74009	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Help Chase. I'll be back.
L73643	u3935	m261	CHASE	Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
L73642	u3933	m261	BATMAN	I haven't had much luck with women...
L73641	u3935	m261	CHASE	You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
L73640	u3933	m261	BATMAN	You are direct, aren't you?
L73639	u3935	m261	CHASE	We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
L73638	u3933	m261	BATMAN	I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
L73637	u3935	m261	CHASE	My life's an open book. You read?
L73636	u3933	m261	BATMAN	We all wear masks.
L73635	u3935	m261	CHASE	I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
L73634	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Try a fireman. Less to take off.
L73633	u3935	m261	CHASE	Now black rubber.
L73632	u3935	m261	CHASE	What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
L73631	u3933	m261	BATMAN	It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
L73630	u3935	m261	CHASE	A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
L73629	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
L73628	u3935	m261	CHASE	I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
L73626	u3935	m261	CHASE	Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
L73625	u3933	m261	BATMAN	What's wrong?
L73624	u3935	m261	CHASE	He's home. I sent the signal.
L73403	u3935	m261	CHASE	I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
L73402	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
L73401	u3935	m261	CHASE	Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
L73400	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Why's that?
L73399	u3935	m261	CHASE	I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
L73398	u3933	m261	BATMAN	...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
L73394	u3933	m261	BATMAN	And you are?
L73393	u3935	m261	CHASE	_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
L74003	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Exactly!
L74002	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
L74001	u3933	m261	BATMAN	I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
L74000	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	For _me_? Really? Tell me.
L73999	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Wait. I have a riddle for you.
L73998	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
L73997	u3933	m261	BATMAN	Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
L73983	u3933	m261	BATMAN	No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
L73982	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
L73794	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
L73793	u3937	m261	EDWARD	I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
L73791	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Banzai.
L73790	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Rinka.
L73789	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Slanta.
L73788	u3937	m261	EDWARD	La'chiem.
L73787	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Nostrovia.
L73786	u3937	m261	EDWARD	No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
L73785	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
L73784	u3934	m261	BRUCE	What? Oh, it's very impressive.
L73781	u3937	m261	EDWARD	The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
L73780	u3934	m261	BRUCE	What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
L73779	u3937	m261	EDWARD	So glad you could come.
L73359	u3937	m261	EDWARD	No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
L73358	u3934	m261	BRUCE	We'll talk some other -
L73357	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Wait. You can't go.
L73356	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
L73340	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
L73339	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
L73338	u3937	m261	EDWARD	What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
L73337	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
L73336	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
L73335	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
L73334	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
L73333	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Mr...?
L73885	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
L73884	u3935	m261	CHASE	What are you talking about?
L73883	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
L73882	u3935	m261	CHASE	What?
L73881	u3934	m261	BRUCE	...Not the bat?
L73880	u3935	m261	CHASE	Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
L73879	u3934	m261	BRUCE	The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
L73878	u3935	m261	CHASE	You do know. Try.
L73877	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I don't-.
L73876	u3935	m261	CHASE	What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
L73875	u3934	m261	BRUCE	My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
L73874	u3935	m261	CHASE	Stop fighting.
L73873	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I don't want to remember!
L73872	u3935	m261	CHASE	Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
L73868	u3935	m261	CHASE	Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
L73867	u3934	m261	BRUCE	There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
L73796	u3935	m261	CHASE	Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
L73795	u3934	m261	BRUCE	And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
L73774	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
L73773	u3935	m261	CHASE	Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
L73772	u3934	m261	BRUCE	So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
L73771	u3935	m261	CHASE	Touchy, touchy.
L73770	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
L73769	u3935	m261	CHASE	If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
L73734	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
L73733	u3935	m261	CHASE	In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
L73732	u3935	m261	CHASE	You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
L73731	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I'm not-
L73730	u3935	m261	CHASE	Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
L73729	u3934	m261	BRUCE	What?
L73728	u3935	m261	CHASE	Why do you do that?
L73724	u3935	m261	CHASE	What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
L73723	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
L73722	u3935	m261	CHASE	Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
L73721	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Why do I feel like the other man, here?
L73720	u3935	m261	CHASE	Find anything interesting?
L73718	u3934	m261	BRUCE	They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
L73717	u3935	m261	CHASE	And now....
L73716	u3934	m261	BRUCE	A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
L73712	u3935	m261	CHASE	Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
L73711	u3934	m261	BRUCE	The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
L73580	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I said I'm sure he did.
L73579	u3935	m261	CHASE	What?
L73578	u3934	m261	BRUCE	He sure did.
L73577	u3935	m261	CHASE	You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
L73576	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Fast work. You just moved here.
L73575	u3935	m261	CHASE	Well, I met someone...
L73574	u3934	m261	BRUCE	But...
L73573	u3935	m261	CHASE	Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
L73572	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
L73571	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
L73570	u3935	m261	CHASE	The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
L73569	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
L73568	u3935	m261	CHASE	I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
L73567	u3934	m261	BRUCE	That kid is amazing.
L73565	u3934	m261	BRUCE	What? This isn't normal?
L73564	u3935	m261	CHASE	Like normal folks.
L73561	u3934	m261	BRUCE	I'm sorry. Who are you?
L73560	u3935	m261	CHASE	I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
L73557	u3934	m261	BRUCE	And into a black dress.
L73556	u3935	m261	CHASE	Excuse me.
L73555	u3934	m261	BRUCE	But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
L73554	u3935	m261	CHASE	Would you? I'm not so sure.
L73553	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
L73552	u3935	m261	CHASE	That's usually my line.
L73551	u3934	m261	BRUCE	No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
L73550	u3935	m261	CHASE	You understand obsession better than you let on.
L73549	u3934	m261	BRUCE	To kill me.
L73548	u3935	m261	CHASE	The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
L73547	u3934	m261	BRUCE	It's a stretch but I'll manage.
L73546	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Not much.
L73545	u3935	m261	CHASE	What do you know about obsession?
L73544	u3934	m261	BRUCE	So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
L73543	u3935	m261	CHASE	I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
L73540	u3935	m261	CHASE	Exactly.
L73539	u3934	m261	BRUCE	So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
L73538	u3935	m261	CHASE	Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
L73537	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Wacko? That a technical term?
L73536	u3935	m261	CHASE	My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
L73535	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
L73534	u3935	m261	CHASE	She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
L73533	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Still play with dolls, Doctor?
L73532	u3934	m261	BRUCE	On occasion. Usually at night.
L73531	u3935	m261	CHASE	The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
L73530	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Just ones this beautiful.
L73529	u3935	m261	CHASE	Psychiatrists make you nervous?
L73528	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
L73527	u3935	m261	CHASE	How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
L73864	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
L73863	u3936	m261	DICK	Bruce, you can't.
L73862	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
L73861	u3934	m261	BRUCE	And when you finally get Two-Face?
L73860	u3936	m261	DICK	But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
L73859	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
L73858	u3936	m261	DICK	You can't-.
L73825	u3936	m261	DICK	I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
L73824	u3934	m261	BRUCE	We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
L73823	u3936	m261	DICK	...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
L73822	u3934	m261	BRUCE	How about Richard Grayson, college student?
L73821	u3936	m261	DICK	You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
L73820	u3934	m261	BRUCE	What the hell did you think you were doing?
L73766	u3936	m261	DICK	Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
L73765	u3934	m261	BRUCE	You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
L73764	u3936	m261	DICK	Back off, man.
L73761	u3934	m261	BRUCE	What I do isn't about revenge.
L73760	u3936	m261	DICK	Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
L73759	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Absolutely not.
L73758	u3936	m261	DICK	I need to be part of this.
L73611	u3936	m261	DICK	Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
L73610	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
L73609	u3936	m261	DICK	I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
L73608	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
L73607	u3936	m261	DICK	I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
L73606	u3934	m261	BRUCE	Excuse me.
L73605	u3936	m261	DICK	Okay. I'm outta here.
L74023	u3935	m261	CHASE	You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
L74022	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Can't tell if you don't say please.
L74021	u3935	m261	CHASE	Who is The Batman, Edward?
L74020	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Yesssssss. I know!
L74019	u3935	m261	CHASE	Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
L74018	u3937	m261	EDWARD	How could I forget?
L74017	u3935	m261	CHASE	It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
L74016	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Who is it?
L74015	u3935	m261	CHASE	Edward...
L73783	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
L73782	u3935	m261	CHASE	Chase?
L73442	u3937	m261	EDWARD	I don't think so.
L73441	u3940	m261	STICKLEY	...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
L73440	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
L73433	u3940	m261	STICKLEY	What the hell is going on here?
L73432	u3937	m261	EDWARD	I'll show you it works.
L73350	u3940	m261	STICKLEY	Fred?
L73349	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
L73348	u3937	m261	EDWARD	...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
L73347	u3940	m261	STICKLEY	Paranoid? The psychotic?
L73346	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
L73342	u3937	m261	EDWARD	Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
L73341	u3940	m261	STICKLEY	I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
L73411	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Never heard of a double-cross?
L73410	u3938	m261	GUARD	Wait! You said you'd let me go!
L73385	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
L73384	u3938	m261	GUARD	Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
L73383	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
L73380	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	The coin _wants_ to decide.
L73379	u3938	m261	GUARD	Please. I swear I won't say noth-
L73378	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	...or death.
L73376	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	What say we flip for it?
L73375	u3938	m261	GUARD	I got family. ...Please.
L73374	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
L73373	u3938	m261	GUARD	...You gonna kill me?
L73372	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	_We_ sure are.
L73963	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	You sunk my battleship.
L73962	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	A hit.
L73961	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
L73960	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	B-12.
L73959	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Miss.
L73958	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	A-14.
L73898	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
L73897	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
L73852	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	You're a genius.
L73851	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Go ahead. You can say it.
L73844	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
L73843	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
L73700	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Everything.
L73699	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	About what?
L73698	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
L73697	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Don't bogart that 'trode.
L73696	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
L73693	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
L73692	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
L73687	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Here. Get a good seat.
L73686	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Where are you sending Batboy this time?
L73670	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
L73669	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	No.  Wait...
L73666	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
L73665	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Holy shit.
L73660	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Let's see if you bleed green.
L73659	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
L73658	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	A man with a death wish.
L73657	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
L73654	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	Congratulations. You get to die on the dean's list.
L73653	u3939	m261	RIDDLER	You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
L73652	u3941	m261	TWO-FACE	How'd you find us?
L78188	u3979	m265	ADAM	I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
L78187	u3984	m265	JANE	Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
L78185	u3984	m265	JANE	Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
L78184	u3979	m265	ADAM	So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
L78183	u3984	m265	JANE	Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
L78182	u3979	m265	ADAM	We're rich in what really matters.
L78181	u3984	m265	JANE	You'll be rich!
L78180	u3979	m265	ADAM	No, Jane.
L78179	u3984	m265	JANE	Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
L79037	u3979	m265	ADAM	All right.
L79036	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
L79025	u3979	m265	ADAM	Give or take a year.
L79024	u3980	m265	BARBARA	3:30 I guess.
L79023	u3979	m265	ADAM	What time is it?
L79007	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Just a hunch.
L79006	u3979	m265	ADAM	What...?
L78932	u3979	m265	ADAM	What makes you think she likes me?
L78931	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
L78927	u3980	m265	BARBARA	You can build another one... with her.
L78926	u3979	m265	ADAM	Let's see if she can get my model back.
L78925	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
L78924	u3979	m265	ADAM	Little black party dresses?
L78923	u3980	m265	BARBARA	You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
L78891	u3979	m265	ADAM	... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
L78890	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
L78786	u3979	m265	ADAM	I didn't --
L78785	u3980	m265	BARBARA	<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
L78774	u3979	m265	ADAM	But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
L78773	u3980	m265	BARBARA	He might have hurt somebody.
L78772	u3979	m265	ADAM	Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
L78711	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Who did the sushi?
L78710	u3979	m265	ADAM	N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
L78709	u3980	m265	BARBARA	The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
L78708	u3979	m265	ADAM	And your sushi was remarkable.
L78664	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
L78663	u3979	m265	ADAM	But <u>we</u> let him out.
L78662	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
L78661	u3979	m265	ADAM	Honey, I think that was a mistake.
L78656	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
L78655	u3979	m265	ADAM	Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
L78654	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Honey.  Let's go.
L78647	u3979	m265	ADAM	... acts like she's thirty-five.
L78646	u3980	m265	BARBARA	She's only fourteen...
L78635	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Maybe we should knock first?
L78634	u3979	m265	ADAM	I guess we open it.
L78632	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
L78631	u3979	m265	ADAM	Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
L78629	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
L78628	u3979	m265	ADAM	Three times.  Powerful number.
L78627	u3980	m265	BARBARA	What happened?
L78626	u3980	m265	BARBARA	<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
L78625	u3979	m265	ADAM	Go ahead... third time's a charm.
L78624	u3980	m265	BARBARA	... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
L78623	u3979	m265	ADAM	I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
L78622	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Here's something.
L78620	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Then it should be here.
L78619	u3979	m265	ADAM	Of course I did.
L78618	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
L78617	u3979	m265	ADAM	This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
L78616	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
L78615	u3979	m265	ADAM	She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
L78614	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
L78588	u3980	m265	BARBARA	You know you're really a pretty girl.
L78587	u3979	m265	ADAM	Where are your skulls and bones?
L78586	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
L78551	u3979	m265	ADAM	It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
L78550	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I feel really stupid.
L78547	u3979	m265	ADAM	Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
L78546	u3980	m265	BARBARA	God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
L78528	u3979	m265	ADAM	Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
L78527	u3980	m265	BARBARA	That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
L78503	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
L78502	u3979	m265	ADAM	We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
L78492	u3979	m265	ADAM	How long do you suppose we were waiting?
L78491	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
L78490	u3979	m265	ADAM	My God, we're back where we started.
L78457	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
L78456	u3979	m265	ADAM	... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
L78442	u3979	m265	ADAM	Wait.
L78441	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
L78439	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
L78438	u3979	m265	ADAM	We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
L78437	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I don't know... what are you looking up?
L78436	u3979	m265	ADAM	Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
L78435	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
L78434	u3979	m265	ADAM	What about this Beetle guy?
L78433	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
L78432	u3979	m265	ADAM	There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
L78411	u3979	m265	ADAM	That's all we need.
L78410	u3980	m265	BARBARA	But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
L78409	u3979	m265	ADAM	She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
L78408	u3980	m265	BARBARA	That little girl saw us.
L78391	u3979	m265	ADAM	Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
L78390	u3980	m265	BARBARA	That's it?  No number, or instructions?
L78388	u3979	m265	ADAM	Not really...  what's this?
L78387	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
L78372	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
L78371	u3979	m265	ADAM	You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
L78370	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
L78368	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I know.  I'm sorry.
L78367	u3979	m265	ADAM	<u>You</u> left me.
L78366	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
L78362	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
L78361	u3979	m265	ADAM	Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
L78360	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No, I'm not putting up with this.
L78359	u3979	m265	ADAM	Oh, honey, we may need that.
L78312	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
L78311	u3979	m265	ADAM	I don't know if there's anything we can do.
L78310	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
L78309	u3979	m265	ADAM	They make gypsies look good.
L78308	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
L78279	u3979	m265	ADAM	That's my girl!
L78278	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
L78276	u3980	m265	BARBARA	At least we won't have to worry about her.
L78275	u3979	m265	ADAM	Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
L78274	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
L78273	u3979	m265	ADAM	Won't?  Or can't?
L78272	u3980	m265	BARBARA	She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
L78271	u3979	m265	ADAM	I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
L78270	u3980	m265	BARBARA	What's she doing here?
L78269	u3979	m265	ADAM	God, it's Jane Butterfield!
L78267	u3979	m265	ADAM	But I'm not hungry, are you?
L78266	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
L78265	u3979	m265	ADAM	Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
L78264	u3980	m265	BARBARA	In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
L78263	u3979	m265	ADAM	Maybe this is heaven.
L78262	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
L78261	u3979	m265	ADAM	Cabin fever, hon?
L78253	u3979	m265	ADAM	I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
L78252	u3980	m265	BARBARA	There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
L78251	u3979	m265	ADAM	This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
L78250	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
L78249	u3979	m265	ADAM	This is going to take some time.
L78248	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I don't think we survived the crash.
L78247	u3979	m265	ADAM	Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
L78246	u3980	m265	BARBARA	De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
L78245	u3979	m265	ADAM	Handbook for the recently diseased.
L78243	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
L78242	u3979	m265	ADAM	Anything happen while I was away?
L78241	u3979	m265	ADAM	... Hmmm?
L78240	u3980	m265	BARBARA	That's how long you were gone.
L78239	u3979	m265	ADAM	What?
L78238	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Two hours.
L78237	u3979	m265	ADAM	You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
L78229	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
L78228	u3979	m265	ADAM	I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
L78227	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I am sitting.
L78226	u3979	m265	ADAM	You'd better sit down, hon.
L78224	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
L78223	u3979	m265	ADAM	How's your arm?
L78222	u3980	m265	BARBARA	This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
L78219	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh... I'm sorry...
L78218	u3979	m265	ADAM	Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
L78217	u3980	m265	BARBARA	You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
L78216	u3979	m265	ADAM	Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
L78215	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
L78200	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Adam!
L78199	u3979	m265	ADAM	Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
L78198	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Wave at the lion.
L78196	u3979	m265	ADAM	Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
L78195	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
L78194	u3979	m265	ADAM	We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
L78193	u3979	m265	ADAM	Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
L78192	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
L78165	u3979	m265	ADAM	It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
L78164	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh no.
L78163	u3979	m265	ADAM	God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
L78162	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
L78161	u3979	m265	ADAM	Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
L78156	u3979	m265	ADAM	God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
L78155	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Helen got it for me in Oslo.
L78154	u3979	m265	ADAM	Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
L78152	u3979	m265	ADAM	Almost.
L78151	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
L78150	u3979	m265	ADAM	She's ready.
L79035	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Oh puh-leeze!
L79034	u3979	m265	ADAM	Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
L79033	u3986	m265	LYDIA	So can I?
L79032	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I got an A!
L79031	u3979	m265	ADAM	We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
L79027	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
L79026	u3979	m265	ADAM	Did you get the paint?
L78895	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Really.  I don't know.
L78894	u3979	m265	ADAM	What is going on?
L78593	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
L78592	u3979	m265	ADAM	You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
L78585	u3986	m265	LYDIA	God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
L78584	u3979	m265	ADAM	We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
L78581	u3986	m265	LYDIA	You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
L78580	u3979	m265	ADAM	We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
L78579	u3986	m265	LYDIA	And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
L78578	u3979	m265	ADAM	I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
L78577	u3986	m265	LYDIA	<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
L78574	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
L78573	u3979	m265	ADAM	We were trying to scare your mother.
L78572	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
L78569	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
L78568	u3979	m265	ADAM	Nobody else can.
L78565	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Is this like a trick question?
L78564	u3979	m265	ADAM	You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
L78560	u3986	m265	LYDIA	<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
L78559	u3979	m265	ADAM	What?
L78558	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
L78557	u3979	m265	ADAM	Aren't you scared?
L78555	u3979	m265	ADAM	We're ghosts.
L78554	u3986	m265	LYDIA	A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
L78472	u3989	m265	RECEPTIONIST	For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
L78471	u3979	m265	ADAM	Wait for who?
L78467	u3989	m265	RECEPTIONIST	D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
L78466	u3979	m265	ADAM	Help vouchers?
L78465	u3989	m265	RECEPTIONIST	Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
L78464	u3979	m265	ADAM	Nine months?  What difference does that make?
L78459	u3979	m265	ADAM	W... We didn't know how to make one.
L78458	u3989	m265	RECEPTIONIST	You don't have an appointment, do you?
L79001	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Now, let's get rolling!
L79000	u3979	m265	ADAM	<u>Barbara</u>?!!
L78781	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
L78780	u3979	m265	ADAM	This is <u>my</u> town.
L78666	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
L78665	u3979	m265	ADAM	Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
L78652	u3979	m265	ADAM	Can you scare them off?
L78651	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
L78650	u3979	m265	ADAM	But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
L78649	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
L78641	u3979	m265	ADAM	You don't kill anyone.
L78640	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
L78639	u3979	m265	ADAM	Aren't you dead?
L78863	u3979	m265	ADAM	<u>Out</u>.
L78862	u3985	m265	JUNO	Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
L78793	u3979	m265	ADAM	Well, we didn't know --
L78792	u3985	m265	JUNO	<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
L78791	u3979	m265	ADAM	Handbook?  When...?
L78526	u3979	m265	ADAM	And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
L78525	u3985	m265	JUNO	<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
L78513	u3985	m265	JUNO	Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
L78512	u3979	m265	ADAM	We have to start simpler, is that it?
L78511	u3985	m265	JUNO	I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
L78509	u3985	m265	JUNO	The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
L78508	u3979	m265	ADAM	We tried.
L78507	u3985	m265	JUNO	Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
L78499	u3985	m265	JUNO	No.  What's wrong?
L78498	u3979	m265	ADAM	Are you available?
L78883	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
L78882	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
L78779	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
L78778	u3980	m265	BARBARA	I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
L78659	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
L78658	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
L78645	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
L78644	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Just one daughter.
L78643	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
L78642	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Just get some people out of our house.
L78638	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	You're the dead.
L78637	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We're...
L78636	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	All right.  Who are you?
L78865	u3985	m265	JUNO	Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
L78864	u3980	m265	BARBARA	What about Betelgeuse?
L78790	u3985	m265	JUNO	You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
L78789	u3980	m265	BARBARA	About what?
L78788	u3985	m265	JUNO	The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
L78523	u3985	m265	JUNO	Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
L78522	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Our cemetery?
L78521	u3985	m265	JUNO	He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
L78520	u3980	m265	BARBARA	What do you mean?  What's he do?
L78519	u3985	m265	JUNO	No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
L78517	u3985	m265	JUNO	No.  You don't want his help.
L78516	u3980	m265	BARBARA	If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
L78515	u3985	m265	JUNO	Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
L78514	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No.
L78505	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Yes.
L78504	u3985	m265	JUNO	-- Like you used to be?
L78501	u3985	m265	JUNO	What do you expect?  You're dead.
L78500	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We're very unhappy.
L78497	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We need help.  We deserve help.
L78496	u3985	m265	JUNO	Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
L78495	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Are you Juno, our case worker?
L78494	u3985	m265	JUNO	I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
L79029	u3986	m265	LYDIA	It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
L79028	u3980	m265	BARBARA	How'd you do on the science test?
L78893	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Step... mother.
L78892	u3980	m265	BARBARA	So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
L78889	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Life is just... too awful.
L78888	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
L78887	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I want to be dead too.
L78886	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No, Lydia, we're dead.
L78885	u3986	m265	LYDIA	He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
L78769	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No, wait!
L78768	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
L78590	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
L78589	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
L78583	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
L78582	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
L78567	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
L78566	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Tell the truth.
L78563	u3980	m265	BARBARA	We're practicing.
L78562	u3986	m265	LYDIA	You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
L78561	u3980	m265	BARBARA	If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
L78176	u3980	m265	BARBARA	'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
L78175	u3984	m265	JANE	Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
L78174	u3984	m265	JANE	Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
L78173	u3980	m265	BARBARA	And live in what, our station wagon?
L78172	u3984	m265	JANE	You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
L78171	u3980	m265	BARBARA	Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
L78170	u3984	m265	JANE	Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
L78169	u3980	m265	BARBARA	No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
L78168	u3984	m265	JANE	Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
L78167	u3980	m265	BARBARA	That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
L78166	u3984	m265	JANE	Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
L78959	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	I'm beeyoo-teeful.
L78958	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Your qu...?  But you're...
L78956	u3986	m265	LYDIA	W... What is it?
L78955	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
L78954	u3986	m265	LYDIA	... I will.
L78953	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Can you help <u>me</u>?
L78952	u3986	m265	LYDIA	You've got to help them.
L78951	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	So... You're ready for me now?
L78857	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
L78856	u3986	m265	LYDIA	They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
L78855	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
L78854	u3986	m265	LYDIA	No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
L78853	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	You've <u>got</u> to say it!
L78852	u3986	m265	LYDIA	You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
L78851	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Just <u>say</u> it.
L78850	u3986	m265	LYDIA	God, you're anatomically correct!
L78849	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
L78848	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
L78847	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	That's it!
L78846	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
L78845	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
L78844	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
L78841	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Good girrrl!
L78840	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Beetle!
L78839	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
L78838	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I don't know what that signal means.
L78837	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
L78836	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	No, dummy.  Two.
L78835	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Three syllables.
L78832	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Of course you do.
L78831	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Yes.
L78830	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
L78829	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I... I don't know what your name is.
L78828	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
L78827	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Yeah.
L78826	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
L78825	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
L78824	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
L78823	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I think so.
L78822	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
L78821	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I want to get in.
L78820	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
L78819	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Are you a spirit too?
L78818	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
L78817	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Where'd they go?
L78816	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
L78815	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
L78814	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
L78812	u3981	m265	BETELGEUSE	They're dead.
L78811	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
L78965	u3988	m265	OTHO	It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
L78964	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Otho?
L78671	u3988	m265	OTHO	I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
L78670	u3982	m265	CHARLES	He's your cousin.
L78669	u3988	m265	OTHO	He's a cloven-hooved beast!
L78668	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
L78301	u3982	m265	CHARLES	That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
L78300	u3988	m265	OTHO	Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
L78911	u3983	m265	DELIA	Not these people!  They are ruthless!
L78910	u3982	m265	CHARLES	They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
L78806	u3983	m265	DELIA	I think she's in with them.
L78805	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Why not?
L78804	u3983	m265	DELIA	Just don't tell Lydia.
L78803	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
L78802	u3983	m265	DELIA	Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
L78801	u3982	m265	CHARLES	What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
L78800	u3983	m265	DELIA	Otho'll know what to do.
L78799	u3982	m265	CHARLES	At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
L78798	u3983	m265	DELIA	I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
L78386	u3982	m265	CHARLES	We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
L78385	u3983	m265	DELIA	Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
L78374	u3982	m265	CHARLES	There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
L78373	u3983	m265	DELIA	I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
L78295	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
L78294	u3983	m265	DELIA	It's <u>Otho</u>!
L78903	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
L78902	u3986	m265	LYDIA	They're... not here anymore.
L78762	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
L78761	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
L78760	u3982	m265	CHARLES	I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
L78759	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Delia will cook...
L78758	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I cannot believe this.
L78757	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
L78750	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
L78749	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
L78745	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
L78744	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Answer your mother.
L78735	u3986	m265	LYDIA	They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
L78734	u3982	m265	CHARLES	The attic room is locked --
L78605	u3986	m265	LYDIA	<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
L78604	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
L78603	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
L78602	u3982	m265	CHARLES	... sheets.
L78601	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Stepmother's...
L78600	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
L78599	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Dad.  Do you believe me?
L78448	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
L78447	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
L78446	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
L78428	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I'm lonely.
L78427	u3982	m265	CHARLES	What?
L78425	u3982	m265	CHARLES	... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
L78424	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Stepmother.
L78423	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
L78421	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Let me have it.
L78420	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
L78414	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
L78413	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
L78412	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Where is your mother?
L78381	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
L78380	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
L78378	u3986	m265	LYDIA	My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
L78377	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
L78290	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Delia hates it.
L78289	u3982	m265	CHARLES	What do you think, honey?
L78947	u3987	m265	MAXIE	They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
L78946	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Are they suffering?
L78913	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Otho, can you do it?
L78912	u3987	m265	MAXIE	I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
L78541	u3987	m265	MAXIE	Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
L78540	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
L78539	u3987	m265	MAXIE	No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
L78538	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
L78536	u3982	m265	CHARLES	No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
L78535	u3987	m265	MAXIE	Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
L78534	u3982	m265	CHARLES	Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
L78756	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I'm sorry already.
L78755	u3983	m265	DELIA	Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
L78742	u3983	m265	DELIA	It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
L78741	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
L78740	u3983	m265	DELIA	All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
L78727	u3983	m265	DELIA	Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
L78726	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
L78681	u3983	m265	DELIA	Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
L78680	u3986	m265	LYDIA	It wasn't a joke.
L78679	u3983	m265	DELIA	Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
L78678	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I saw some ghosts.
L78677	u3983	m265	DELIA	Don't you <u>dare</u>.
L78613	u3983	m265	DELIA	Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
L78612	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
L78611	u3983	m265	DELIA	I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
L78407	u3983	m265	DELIA	Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
L78406	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Any particular kind?
L78405	u3983	m265	DELIA	<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
L78383	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I say let's keep it the way it is.
L78382	u3983	m265	DELIA	We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
L78376	u3983	m265	DELIA	This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
L78375	u3986	m265	LYDIA	I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
L78945	u3988	m265	OTHO	I don't know.
L78944	u3983	m265	DELIA	What's happening to them?
L78909	u3988	m265	OTHO	Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
L78908	u3983	m265	DELIA	Are they still here, Otho?
L78748	u3983	m265	DELIA	Look at the tiny figures.
L78747	u3988	m265	OTHO	Look at that <u>detail</u>!
L78715	u3988	m265	OTHO	We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
L78714	u3983	m265	DELIA	It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
L78695	u3983	m265	DELIA	She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
L78694	u3988	m265	OTHO	Oh, Delia, lighten up!
L78693	u3983	m265	DELIA	<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
L78692	u3988	m265	OTHO	Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
L78355	u3983	m265	DELIA	Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
L78354	u3988	m265	OTHO	I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
L78353	u3983	m265	DELIA	Maybe Charles does.
L78352	u3988	m265	OTHO	You don't have a key?
L78348	u3988	m265	OTHO	Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
L78347	u3983	m265	DELIA	Attic space.
L78346	u3988	m265	OTHO	'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
L78340	u3988	m265	OTHO	Oh, as long as we're here...
L78339	u3983	m265	DELIA	That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
L78338	u3988	m265	OTHO	Is there much more of this torture?
L78337	u3988	m265	OTHO	Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
L78336	u3983	m265	DELIA	Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
L78329	u3988	m265	OTHO	<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
L78328	u3983	m265	DELIA	<u>Oh my God</u>!
L78326	u3983	m265	DELIA	Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
L78325	u3988	m265	OTHO	Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
L78324	u3983	m265	DELIA	Viridian?  What is...?
L78323	u3988	m265	OTHO	Viridian?
L78322	u3983	m265	DELIA	What do you think?
L78320	u3988	m265	OTHO	Gooood!
L78319	u3983	m265	DELIA	<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
L78318	u3988	m265	OTHO	You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
L78317	u3983	m265	DELIA	Okay?
L78316	u3988	m265	OTHO	I thought I saw something.
L78315	u3983	m265	DELIA	What's wrong?
L78304	u3988	m265	OTHO	No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
L78303	u3983	m265	DELIA	The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
L78302	u3988	m265	OTHO	Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
L78299	u3983	m265	DELIA	I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
L78298	u3988	m265	OTHO	That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
L79013	u3984	m265	JANE	Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
L79012	u3986	m265	LYDIA	It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
L79011	u3984	m265	JANE	Hellooo!  How's school?
L78402	u3984	m265	JANE	Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
L78401	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
L78400	u3984	m265	JANE	Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
L78399	u3984	m265	JANE	That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
L78398	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Is this the key to the attic?
L78395	u3986	m265	LYDIA	What happened to the people who used to live here?
L78394	u3984	m265	JANE	Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
L78941	u3988	m265	OTHO	As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
L78940	u3986	m265	LYDIA	<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
L78920	u3988	m265	OTHO	Their wedding clothes.
L78919	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Their wedding clothes.
L78917	u3988	m265	OTHO	I'll need something personal of theirs.
L78916	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
L78764	u3986	m265	LYDIA	That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
L78763	u3988	m265	OTHO	Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
L78733	u3986	m265	LYDIA	The attic.
L78732	u3988	m265	OTHO	All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
L78725	u3988	m265	OTHO	Why not?
L78724	u3986	m265	LYDIA	They don't want to come down.
L78306	u3988	m265	OTHO	My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
L78305	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Otho, that's terrible.
L78297	u3986	m265	LYDIA	Hold your breath and we'll pull.
L78296	u3988	m265	OTHO	It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
L83038	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
L83037	u4018	m267	AGENT	Oh yeah, he's good.
L83036	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
L83035	u4018	m267	AGENT	Okay.
L83034	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
L83029	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	This is my fiancee Maxine.
L83028	u4018	m267	AGENT	John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
L82628	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yeah, okay.
L82627	u4019	m267	CABBIE	I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
L82626	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I don't know.
L82625	u4019	m267	CABBIE	Who am I thinking of?
L82624	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I never played a jewel thief.
L82623	u4019	m267	CABBIE	The one where you're that jewel thief.
L82622	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Thank you.
L82619	u4019	m267	CABBIE	Malkovich!
L82618	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Malkovich.
L82615	u4019	m267	CABBIE	John Makel...
L82614	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yeah.
L82613	u4019	m267	CABBIE	Say, aren't you that actor guy?
L82769	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
L82768	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Tell your friends.
L82767	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
L82758	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
L82757	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
L82756	u4023	m267	ERROLL	When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
L82755	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Please, have a seat.
L82754	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Hello, I'm here about the ad.
L83240	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
L83239	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
L83238	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I know.
L83237	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
L83236	u4029	m267	LOTTE	People make mistakes.
L83235	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
L83234	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
L83233	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
L83232	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
L83231	u4020	m267	CRAIG	And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
L83230	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
L83229	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You came up here looking for the portal?
L83228	u4029	m267	LOTTE	It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
L83227	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm sorry for everything.
L83226	u4029	m267	LOTTE	A better friend.
L83225	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
L83224	u4029	m267	LOTTE	The monkey.
L83223	u4020	m267	CRAIG	The iguana?
L83222	u4029	m267	LOTTE	It's Elijah.
L83221	u4020	m267	CRAIG	He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
L83220	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
L83219	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
L83218	u4029	m267	LOTTE	My God!
L82953	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I love you so much.
L82952	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
L82951	u4020	m267	CRAIG	"I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, ""he's some kind of monster."""
L82950	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I need a shower.
L82949	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
L82948	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
L82947	u4020	m267	CRAIG	That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
L82946	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
L82945	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
L82944	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You fell in love with her first.
L82943	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
L82942	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
L82875	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm a puppeteer.
L82874	u4029	m267	LOTTE	What's that?
L82873	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
L82872	u4029	m267	LOTTE	It'll never happen, fuckface.
L82871	u4020	m267	CRAIG	It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
L82859	u4029	m267	LOTTE	What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
L82858	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
L82854	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You bastard.
L82853	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Tell her you need to see her.
L82852	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Shut up!
L82851	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Suck my dick!
L82850	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
L82849	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
L82831	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
L82830	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
L82829	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Life is confusing, isn't it?
L82828	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm sorry. That was nasty.
L82827	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
L82826	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Don't forget me.
L82825	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Me and John.
L82824	u4020	m267	CRAIG	We?
L82823	u4029	m267	LOTTE	We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
L82822	u4020	m267	CRAIG	And he was with her.
L82821	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Yes.
L82820	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You were him last night, weren't you?
L82802	u4020	m267	CRAIG	We wish.
L82801	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Fuck Maxine.
L82800	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What about Maxine?
L82798	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Us, of course.
L82797	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What's that?
L82796	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
L82795	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You've always loved the animals.
L82794	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You've always hated the animals.
L82793	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No they're not.
L82792	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
L82791	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What?
L82790	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
L82789	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
L82788	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
L82787	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
L82786	u4029	m267	LOTTE	What are you doing?
L82744	u4020	m267	CRAIG	After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
L82743	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
L82742	u4029	m267	LOTTE	It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We?ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
L82741	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
L82740	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
L82739	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
L82738	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
L82737	u4020	m267	CRAIG	So how was it? What was he doing?
L82723	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Don't crowd me, Craig.
L82722	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Why?
L82721	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
L82720	u4020	m267	CRAIG	How was it?
L82701	u4020	m267	CRAIG	This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
L82700	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
L82699	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
L82698	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
L82697	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Why aren't you at work?
L82691	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
L82690	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
L82673	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
L82672	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
L82671	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
L82670	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
L82669	u4020	m267	CRAIG	We'll talk about it in the car.
L82668	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I have to go back now.
L82667	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
L82666	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I have to go back.
L82662	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm scared.
L82661	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'll meet you on the turnpike.
L82660	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
L82659	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Now?
L82658	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
L82657	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
L82656	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What?
L82655	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I want to try.
L82654	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
L82653	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
L82584	u4029	m267	LOTTE	'kay.
L82583	u4020	m267	CRAIG	All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
L82582	u4029	m267	LOTTE	No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
L82581	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yeah. You want a beer?
L82580	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
L82579	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Right.
L82578	u4029	m267	LOTTE	The iguana.
L82577	u4020	m267	CRAIG	The ferret?
L82576	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
L82575	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm sorry. How was your evening?
L82574	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I was worried.
L82573	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
L82572	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Did you eat?
L82571	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We?re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
L82570	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Hi.
L82569	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Hi.
L82507	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Just an idea I had.
L82506	u4029	m267	LOTTE	She's very beautiful.
L82505	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yeah, just an idea I had.
L82479	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Hmmm.
L82478	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
L82477	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Hmmm.
L82476	u4029	m267	LOTTE	They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
L82475	u4020	m267	CRAIG	We have to make it an early night.
L82474	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Seven-ish
L82473	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
L82472	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
L82392	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I... puppeteer.
L82391	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Why, Craig. why?
L82390	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm a puppeteer.
L82389	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Why'd you do it, Craig?
L82388	u4020	m267	CRAIG	May 11th.
L82387	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Is the trial date set?
L82383	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yeah. Okay.
L82382	u4029	m267	LOTTE	The monkey.
L82381	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Which one is Elijah again?
L82380	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
L82379	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What?
L82378	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
L82377	u4020	m267	CRAIG	The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
L82376	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
L82375	u4020	m267	CRAIG	We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
L82374	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
L82373	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Enjoy.
L82372	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
L82371	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Morning.
L82939	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
L82938	u4020	m267	CRAIG	With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
L82937	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
L82936	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
L82935	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
L82934	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I know. I'm sorry...
L82933	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	That... was... no... simulation.
L82932	u4020	m267	CRAIG	So how was it?
L82919	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Let me try!
L82918	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
L82917	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Let me try.
L82916	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Sure, after a fashion.
L82915	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Simulates?
L82914	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
L82881	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Holy shit! He said what I said!
L82880	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Holy shit! He said what I said!
L82879	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Holy shit, yes!
L82878	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Holy shit, yes!
L82868	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
L82867	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Maxine...
L82512	u4025	m267	FLORIS	I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
L82511	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I?m in love with somebody else.
L82497	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
L82496	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I am a trained performer.
L82495	u4025	m267	FLORIS	You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
L82414	u4025	m267	FLORIS	You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
L82413	u4020	m267	CRAIG	"I said ""yes."""
L82412	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Yex?
L82411	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yes?
L82410	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Mr. Juarez?
L82408	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Forget it.
L82407	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Money, Miss Warts?
L82406	u4020	m267	CRAIG	My name is Schwartz.
L82405	u4025	m267	FLORIS	I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
L82404	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Schwartz.
L82403	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Pardon?
L82402	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Schwartz.
L82401	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
L82400	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
L82399	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
L82776	u4028	m267	LESTER	I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
L82775	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You're insane.
L82774	u4028	m267	LESTER	There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
L82773	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
L82772	u4028	m267	LESTER	You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
L82686	u4028	m267	LESTER	The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain ?doors? which should never be opened.
L82685	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
L82684	u4028	m267	LESTER	And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
L82683	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
L82682	u4028	m267	LESTER	I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
L82681	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
L82680	u4028	m267	LESTER	More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
L82679	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Dr. Lester...
L82600	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Thank you, sir.
L82599	u4028	m267	LESTER	Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
L82598	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
L82597	u4028	m267	LESTER	Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
L82596	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Dr. Lester. . .
L82544	u4020	m267	CRAIG	That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
L82543	u4028	m267	LESTER	Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
L82542	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yessir.
L82541	u4028	m267	LESTER	Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
L82540	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
L82539	u4028	m267	LESTER	Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. ?Ladies,? I begin. ?I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
L82521	u4028	m267	LESTER	All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
L82520	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
L82519	u4028	m267	LESTER	I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
L82518	u4020	m267	CRAIG	The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
L82517	u4028	m267	LESTER	No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
L82516	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'll keep that in mind, sir.
L82515	u4028	m267	LESTER	One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
L82514	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
L82513	u4028	m267	LESTER	Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
L82438	u4028	m267	LESTER	Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
L82437	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Just one. Why is this floor so short?
L82436	u4028	m267	LESTER	Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
L82435	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No. I understand perfectly.
L82434	u4028	m267	LESTER	Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
L82433	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No.
L82432	u4028	m267	LESTER	"Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, ""I can't understand a word any of you are saying."""
L82431	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
L82425	u4028	m267	LESTER	Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
L82424	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Glooph is not a letter, sir.
L82423	u4028	m267	LESTER	You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
L82422	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
L82421	u4028	m267	LESTER	Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
L82420	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
L82419	u4028	m267	LESTER	She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you?re implying.
L82418	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
L82417	u4028	m267	LESTER	Security.
L82416	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
L82415	u4028	m267	LESTER	Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
L82955	u4032	m267	MAXINE	J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
L82954	u4020	m267	CRAIG	But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
L82924	u4032	m267	MAXINE	How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
L82923	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
L82921	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
L82920	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Let him try.
L82883	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
L82882	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Lotte? Is that you?
L82877	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
L82876	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Lotte, this is so good...
L82870	u4032	m267	MAXINE	A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
L82869	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You're glowing again.
L82838	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
L82837	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You're evil, Maxine.
L82836	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
L82835	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
L82834	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I've fallen in love.
L82833	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Are you torturing me on purpose?
L82832	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You're late.
L82771	u4032	m267	MAXINE	So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
L82770	u4020	m267	CRAIG	This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
L82750	u4020	m267	CRAIG	My God.
L82749	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
L82689	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
L82688	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
L82651	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I'll protect you, Dollface.
L82650	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
L82649	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Sure. It'd be fun.
L82648	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You wanted to be partners with me?
L82647	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
L82646	u4020	m267	CRAIG	But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
L82645	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
L82644	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Tickets to Malkovich?
L82643	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Good. We'll sell tickets.
L82642	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
L82641	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
L82640	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
L82639	u4032	m267	MAXINE	What's he been in?
L82638	u4020	m267	CRAIG	He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
L82637	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
L82636	u4020	m267	CRAIG	There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
L82635	u4032	m267	MAXINE	It better be.
L82634	u4020	m267	CRAIG	This is important!
L82633	u4032	m267	MAXINE	No.
L82632	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Don't you want to know what happened to me?
L82592	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
L82591	u4020	m267	CRAIG	It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
L82590	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Please, let me explain.
L82589	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Yikes.
L82588	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
L82587	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
L82586	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Hi.
L82567	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Well, I'm a puppeteer...
L82566	u4032	m267	MAXINE	So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
L82565	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
L82564	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
L82563	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
L82562	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I mean, I am really attracted to you.
L82561	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You're a fag or a liar.
L82560	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I?m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
L82558	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Don?t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
L82557	u4020	m267	CRAIG	That's the usual?
L82556	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
L82555	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
L82554	u4032	m267	MAXINE	My tits?
L82553	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
L82552	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
L82551	u4032	m267	MAXINE	The usual, Barry.
L82550	u4020	m267	CRAIG	What'll you have?
L82549	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Yeah. But enough about me.
L82548	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You married?
L82547	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Buy you a drink, Maxine?
L82546	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Just.
L82545	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
L82538	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Maxine.
L82537	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
L82536	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
L82535	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Somebody told you.
L82534	u4020	m267	CRAIG	That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
L82533	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Who told you?
L82532	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I'm right?
L82531	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Who told you?
L82530	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
L82529	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Why not?
L82528	u4020	m267	CRAIG	How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
L82527	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Yeah.
L82526	u4020	m267	CRAIG	I just wanted to say ?hi.?  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
L82525	u4032	m267	MAXINE	What?
L82503	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
L82502	u4020	m267	CRAIG	No, really.
L82501	u4032	m267	MAXINE	And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
L82500	u4020	m267	CRAIG	You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
L82499	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Yes, well...
L82464	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I wouldn't know.
L82463	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Emily Dickinson.
L82462	u4032	m267	MAXINE	How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
L82461	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
L82460	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
L82459	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Is that true?
L82458	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
L82457	u4020	m267	CRAIG	Moving story.
L82604	u4021	m267	DON	That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
L82603	u4035	m267	WENDY	Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it?s for.
L82602	u4021	m267	DON	Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
L82456	u4035	m267	WENDY	Ha ha ha!
L82455	u4021	m267	DON	So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
L82443	u4021	m267	DON	It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
L82442	u4035	m267	WENDY	Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
L82441	u4021	m267	DON	Hello. Wendy.
L82440	u4035	m267	WENDY	Hello, Don.
L83216	u4022	m267	ELIJAH	Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
L83215	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
L83214	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Hush, sweetheart.
L83213	u4022	m267	ELIJAH	If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
L83212	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
L83211	u4022	m267	ELIJAH	Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
L83174	u4022	m267	ELIJAH	It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
L83173	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
L83172	u4022	m267	ELIJAH	You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
L82766	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
L82765	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Two hundred dollars, please.
L82764	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
L82763	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You can be John Malkovich.
L82762	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Can I be anyone I want?
L82761	u4032	m267	MAXINE	No. Don't be an ass.
L82760	u4023	m267	ERROLL	Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
L82759	u4032	m267	MAXINE	No.
L83171	u4028	m267	LESTER	Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
L83170	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
L83169	u4028	m267	LESTER	Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
L83168	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Fine. Let's drop it.
L83167	u4028	m267	LESTER	I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
L83166	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
L83165	u4028	m267	LESTER	Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
L83164	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
L83163	u4028	m267	LESTER	I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
L83162	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Why are you being like this?
L83161	u4028	m267	LESTER	Do tell. I love a good plan.
L83160	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	But I think I have another plan.
L83159	u4028	m267	LESTER	"Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do ""Tru"" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational."
L83158	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
L83157	u4028	m267	LESTER	The Great Mantini?
L83156	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
L83155	u4028	m267	LESTER	What kind of circumstances?
L83154	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
L83153	u4028	m267	LESTER	How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
L83110	u4028	m267	LESTER	I like that.
L83109	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
L83108	u4028	m267	LESTER	A scary dream?
L83107	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
L83106	u4028	m267	LESTER	Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
L83105	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Impressions? Those are hard.
L83104	u4028	m267	LESTER	The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
L83103	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Vegas? What'd you think?
L83102	u4028	m267	LESTER	We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
L83101	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
L83081	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
L83080	u4028	m267	LESTER	Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
L83079	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
L83078	u4028	m267	LESTER	And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
L83077	u4024	m267	FLEMMER	Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
L82843	u4028	m267	LESTER	Good morning, Lotte!
L82842	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Think, Jew florist?
L82841	u4028	m267	LESTER	Thank you, Floris.
L82840	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
L82839	u4028	m267	LESTER	Yes, my dear?
L82430	u4028	m267	LESTER	Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
L82429	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Fork ah did?
L82428	u4028	m267	LESTER	Forget it.
L82427	u4025	m267	FLORIS	Gehginnis ondah foam?
L82426	u4028	m267	LESTER	Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
L83181	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Do you?
L83180	u4026	m267	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	Says me. Do you dream often?
L83179	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Says who?
L83178	u4026	m267	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
L83177	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Do you?
L83176	u4026	m267	HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	Do you dream often?
L82903	u4027	m267	KEVIN BACON	The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
L82902	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
L82901	u4027	m267	KEVIN BACON	All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
L82900	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
L82899	u4027	m267	KEVIN BACON	You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
L82898	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
L82897	u4027	m267	KEVIN BACON	Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
L82896	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
L82895	u4027	m267	KEVIN BACON	You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
L82894	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
L82893	u4027	m267	KEVIN BACON	Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
L82892	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
L82891	u4027	m267	KEVIN BACON	I'm sure you're not going crazy.
L82890	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
L83076	u4028	m267	LESTER	Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
L83075	u4036	m267	WOMAN #1	Count me in.
L83074	u4028	m267	LESTER	But of course.
L83073	u4036	m267	WOMAN #1	Do we get to wear a crown?
L83072	u4028	m267	LESTER	Anybody else?
L83062	u4028	m267	LESTER	Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
L83061	u4036	m267	WOMAN #1	You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
L83052	u4028	m267	LESTER	I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
L83051	u4029	m267	LOTTE	That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
L83050	u4028	m267	LESTER	I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
L83049	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Why not? I need to get in there!
L83048	u4028	m267	LESTER	Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
L83022	u4028	m267	LESTER	I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
L83021	u4029	m267	LOTTE	It's Craig in there, I can tell.
L83020	u4028	m267	LESTER	No! Don't harm the vessel!
L83019	u4029	m267	LOTTE	You bastard!
L83018	u4028	m267	LESTER	Aaaahhhh, the portal!
L82988	u4028	m267	LESTER	Oh, sorry. Right this way.
L82987	u4029	m267	LOTTE	No.
L82986	u4028	m267	LESTER	Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
L82985	u4029	m267	LOTTE	No, I didn't know that.
L82984	u4028	m267	LESTER	What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
L82983	u4029	m267	LOTTE	No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
L82982	u4028	m267	LESTER	Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
L82981	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
L82980	u4028	m267	LESTER	You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
L82848	u4028	m267	LESTER	My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
L82847	u4029	m267	LOTTE	But now we've lost access to Craig.
L82846	u4028	m267	LESTER	You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
L82845	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I blew it, Dr. Lester.
L82785	u4028	m267	LESTER	We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
L82784	u4029	m267	LOTTE	But why, Son of Malkovich?
L82783	u4028	m267	LESTER	No you mustn't, my child.
L82782	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I'm getting divorced.
L82678	u4028	m267	LESTER	With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
L82677	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
L82676	u4028	m267	LESTER	Oh, be still my heart.
L82675	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
L82674	u4028	m267	LESTER	Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
L82967	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
L82966	u4029	m267	LOTTE	But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
L82965	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
L82964	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
L82957	u4032	m267	MAXINE	One hour.
L82956	u4029	m267	LOTTE	We have to meet.
L82857	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
L82856	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I have to see you.
L82855	u4032	m267	MAXINE	J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
L82813	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Maxine...
L82812	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I love you, Lotte.
L82811	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
L82806	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
L82805	u4032	m267	MAXINE	When?
L82804	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
L82803	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Yes?
L82746	u4029	m267	LOTTE	After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
L82745	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Ah.
L82734	u4029	m267	LOTTE	I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
L82733	u4032	m267	MAXINE	And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
L82703	u4032	m267	MAXINE	"Let her go, Craig. I mean ?him."""
L82702	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
L82696	u4032	m267	MAXINE	"Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. ""Ever want to be someone else?"" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. ""Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."""
L82695	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
L82693	u4029	m267	LOTTE	Yes, Hi.
L82692	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
L83152	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Who needs dancing?
L83151	u4031	m267	MANTINI	No.
L83150	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Is there dancing?
L83149	u4031	m267	MANTINI	Great then.
L83148	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	"I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of ""Long Day's Journey Into Night."""
L83147	u4031	m267	MANTINI	Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
L83146	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
L83145	u4031	m267	MANTINI	Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
L83144	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Never heard of it.
L83143	u4031	m267	MANTINI	"Say... ""Equus""? It's got everything."
L83142	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	What's the play?
L83141	u4031	m267	MANTINI	A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
L83140	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	How do we do that?
L83137	u4031	m267	MANTINI	We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
L83136	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	She's not available.
L83133	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
L83132	u4031	m267	MANTINI	Yeah, I saw them
L83131	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Did you see the reviews?
L83130	u4031	m267	MANTINI	Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
L83201	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Whatever.
L83200	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Good-bye, Maxine.
L83129	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Derek Mantini!
L83128	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Yeah what?!
L83127	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
L83126	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
L83123	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
L83122	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You've got to be kidding.
L83121	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I've got to leave Malkovich.
L83120	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Bad dream, darling?
L83114	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
L83113	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Sleepy suddenly.
L83112	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
L83111	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	"They love me, darling! ""Craig Schwartz is fantastic!""  The New York Times. ""If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!""  Women's Wear Daily. ""Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!""  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio."
L83089	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	He's a selfish bastard.
L83088	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
L83087	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
L83086	u4032	m267	MAXINE	This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
L83040	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Vegas. Can you arrange that?
L83039	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Vegas.
L83017	u4032	m267	MAXINE	It's okay, my sweet.
L83016	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
L83010	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
L83009	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
L83008	u4032	m267	MAXINE	No one would ever have to know its not him.
L83007	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
L83006	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
L83005	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
L83004	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Stay in him forever?
L83003	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
L83002	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
L83001	u4032	m267	MAXINE	That was incredible. You're brilliant!
L82999	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Really? Yeah. Okay.
L82998	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I'd love to see your work.
L82997	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	You mean with Malkovich?
L82996	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
L82995	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
L82994	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You still there, sweets?
L82979	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
L82978	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
L82977	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	I'm getting better all the time.
L82976	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
L82975	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Oh, so the bitch escaped.
L82974	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Lotte called me.
L82973	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yes. How did you know it was me?
L82972	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
L82971	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
L82970	u4032	m267	MAXINE	I can explain about the portal, darling.
L82969	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Come on in.
L82913	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	What the fuck is going on?
L82912	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Darling!
L82888	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
L82887	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
L82886	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
L82885	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Oh, Lotte...
L82884	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
L82818	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yes, Maxine, yes.
L82817	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
L82816	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
L82815	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Do you mind?
L82814	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	"I'm sorry, did you just call me ""Lotte""?"
L82810	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
L82809	u4032	m267	MAXINE	So, do you enjoy being an actor?
L82808	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Oh, I'm really glad you called.
L82807	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Thanks so much for coming over.
L82736	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Whatever you're having.
L82735	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Can I get you a drink?
L82715	u4032	m267	MAXINE	It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
L82714	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	How'd you get this number?
L82713	u4032	m267	MAXINE	You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
L82712	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Who's calling?
L82711	u4032	m267	MAXINE	Mr. Malkovich?
L82710	u4030	m267	MALKOVICH	Yeah?
L82453	u4034	m267	TINY WOMAN	Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
L82452	u4033	m267	MERTIN	Aye. Speak then if ye must.
L82451	u4034	m267	TINY WOMAN	I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
L82450	u4033	m267	MERTIN	I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
L82449	u4034	m267	TINY WOMAN	I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
L82448	u4033	m267	MERTIN	What want ye, girl child?
L82447	u4034	m267	TINY WOMAN	Captain Mertin?
L90110	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I want to see the sun rise.
L90109	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you want me to do?
L90106	u4071	m271	BLADE	Not good.
L90105	u4076	m271	NYSSA	How does it look?
L90012	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I don't understand.
L90011	u4071	m271	BLADE	"It means ""bloodbrother."""
L90003	u4071	m271	BLADE	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
L90002	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're hurting me.
L90000	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
L89999	u4071	m271	BLADE	I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
L89998	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Why do you hate us so much?
L89997	u4076	m271	NYSSA	If that's true, then why'd you save me?
L89996	u4071	m271	BLADE	Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
L89995	u4076	m271	NYSSA	It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
L89994	u4071	m271	BLADE	Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
L89993	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Why?
L89992	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't want to go there.
L89991	u4071	m271	BLADE	I wouldn't read too much into it.
L89990	u4076	m271	NYSSA	It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
L89989	u4071	m271	BLADE	For what?
L89988	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Thank you.
L89987	u4071	m271	BLADE	I don't think so.
L89986	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Anyone else make it?
L89985	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.
L89984	u4071	m271	BLADE	What?
L89983	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Each day is a little life.
L89974	u4071	m271	BLADE	Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
L89973	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Blade.
L89952	u4071	m271	BLADE	Fry 'em.
L89951	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
L89909	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
L89908	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't have to hunt to do it.
L89907	u4076	m271	NYSSA	He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
L89871	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
L89870	u4071	m271	BLADE	Like cancer with a purpose.
L89869	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
L89864	u4071	m271	BLADE	Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
L89863	u4076	m271	NYSSA	If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
L89862	u4071	m271	BLADE	No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
L89861	u4071	m271	BLADE	Time.
L89860	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
L89859	u4071	m271	BLADE	Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
L89858	u4076	m271	NYSSA	From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
L89857	u4071	m271	BLADE	Recognize him?
L89826	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Minutes.
L89825	u4071	m271	BLADE	how long since he was bitten?
L89821	u4076	m271	NYSSA	I didn't know.
L89820	u4071	m271	BLADE	He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
L89819	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What about Nomak?
L89818	u4071	m271	BLADE	I'll heal.
L89817	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're hurt.
L89804	u4071	m271	BLADE	Nothing.
L89803	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What was that?
L89796	u4076	m271	NYSSA	We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
L89795	u4071	m271	BLADE	What is it with you people and pain?
L89791	u4071	m271	BLADE	I haven't forgotten.
L89790	u4076	m271	NYSSA	This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
L89778	u4076	m271	NYSSA	The House of Pain.
L89777	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where to first?
L89759	u4071	m271	BLADE	We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
L89758	u4076	m271	NYSSA	What the hell are you doing, Blade?
L89757	u4071	m271	BLADE	You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
L89743	u4076	m271	NYSSA	No.  They've been training to hunt you.
L89742	u4071	m271	BLADE	"Then they weren't created to go after your ""patient zero""."
L89741	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Two years.
L89736	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
L89735	u4071	m271	BLADE	Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
L89730	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Survival.
L89729	u4071	m271	BLADE	Why?
L89712	u4076	m271	NYSSA	They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
L89711	u4071	m271	BLADE	What?
L90089	u4071	m271	BLADE	Blood...
L90088	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
L90021	u4071	m271	BLADE	Then who does he work for?
L90020	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
L90019	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
L90018	u4071	m271	BLADE	What's your problem, Whistler?
L90016	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Just out connecting a few dots.
L90015	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where the hell have you been?
L90014	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Your security's for shit, kid.
L89939	u4071	m271	BLADE	We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
L89938	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
L89892	u4071	m271	BLADE	It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
L89891	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
L89890	u4071	m271	BLADE	Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
L89889	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
L89888	u4071	m271	BLADE	I wouldn't worry about it.
L89887	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
L89841	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I'll show you.
L89840	u4071	m271	BLADE	Where were you, Whistler?
L89835	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
L89834	u4071	m271	BLADE	I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
L89787	u4071	m271	BLADE	I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
L89786	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	I don't like it.
L89785	u4071	m271	BLADE	He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
L89747	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
L89746	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you really think?
L89745	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Sounds like a plan.
L89744	u4071	m271	BLADE	What do you think?
L89709	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Either that or feeding the worms.
L89708	u4071	m271	BLADE	I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
L89675	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
L89674	u4071	m271	BLADE	Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
L89673	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Took you long enough.
L89672	u4071	m271	BLADE	Did you think I wouldn't?
L89671	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You came back for me.
L89670	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
L89669	u4071	m271	BLADE	How do you feel?
L90043	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
L90042	u4071	m271	BLADE	Thought you were dead.
L90041	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Put it back in park, Blade.
L89947	u4071	m271	BLADE	So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
L89946	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	So?
L89945	u4071	m271	BLADE	Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
L89882	u4071	m271	BLADE	You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
L89881	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
L89880	u4071	m271	BLADE	Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
L89879	u4077	m271	REINHARDT	And so will we.
L90080	u4071	m271	BLADE	Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
L90079	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	And why is that?
L90078	u4071	m271	BLADE	Too bad you're out of it.
L90077	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
L90037	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	I should think that would be obvious at this point.
L90036	u4071	m271	BLADE	The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
L89738	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Not alone.
L89737	u4071	m271	BLADE	You want me to hunt them for you.
L89722	u4071	m271	BLADE	For what?
L89721	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
L90058	u4071	m271	BLADE	Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
L90057	u4078	m271	SCUD	So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
L90047	u4078	m271	SCUD	You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
L90046	u4071	m271	BLADE	Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
L90008	u4071	m271	BLADE	He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
L90007	u4078	m271	SCUD	Nomak?
L90006	u4071	m271	BLADE	He was here.  Watching us.
L90005	u4078	m271	SCUD	What's going on?
L89749	u4071	m271	BLADE	Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
L89748	u4078	m271	SCUD	So you're going to do this?
L89693	u4071	m271	BLADE	Human?
L89692	u4078	m271	SCUD	Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
L89664	u4078	m271	SCUD	I don't know about this, man --
L89663	u4071	m271	BLADE	Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
L89662	u4071	m271	BLADE	Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
L89661	u4078	m271	SCUD	You got something in mind, Blade?
L89950	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
L89949	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What the fuck you doing?
L89942	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
L89941	u4072	m271	CHUPA	We want to attract them, not scare them off.
L89839	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
L89838	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
L89837	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
L89836	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
L89770	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Well you've got it, warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
L89769	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Getting your attention, Paco.
L89768	u4072	m271	CHUPA	Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
L90097	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Maybe it's better that way.
L90096	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
L90095	u4076	m271	NYSSA	We're locked in.
L90072	u4076	m271	NYSSA	You experimented on your own, son?
L90071	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	From his father, of course.
L90070	u4076	m271	NYSSA	Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
L90069	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
L89734	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
L89733	u4076	m271	NYSSA	His name is Jared Nomak.
L89854	u4079	m271	STEVENS	As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
L89853	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
L89851	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
L89850	u4079	m271	STEVENS	No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
L89849	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
L89848	u4079	m271	STEVENS	Two so far.
L89847	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Any casualties?
L89846	u4079	m271	STEVENS	They've made contact with the Reapers.
L89845	u4073	m271	DAMASKINOS	Yes?
L89643	u4074	m271	NOMAK	Us?  What are you talking about?
L89642	u4075	m271	NURSE	Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
L89640	u4075	m271	NURSE	It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
L89639	u4074	m271	NOMAK	No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
L89638	u4075	m271	NURSE	Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
L89637	u4074	m271	NOMAK	Not that I'm in contact with.
L89636	u4075	m271	NURSE	I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
L90054	u4078	m271	SCUD	Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
L90053	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You little shit.  When did they get to you?
L90052	u4078	m271	SCUD	Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
L89929	u4078	m271	SCUD	After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
L89928	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	What about you?  You're not coming?
L89921	u4078	m271	SCUD	"I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take ""E"", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, ""Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"""
L89920	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Pretty.
L89919	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
L89918	u4078	m271	SCUD	Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
L89917	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Going on twenty years now.
L89916	u4078	m271	SCUD	So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
L89915	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Nope.  Back then we did not.
L89914	u4078	m271	SCUD	Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
L89913	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	You're wasting your time, already been tried.
L89912	u4078	m271	SCUD	Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
L89911	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	The hell are you fiddling with there?
L89707	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
L89706	u4078	m271	SCUD	This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
L89691	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
L89690	u4078	m271	SCUD	Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
L89688	u4078	m271	SCUD	Look, what's your problem?
L89687	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
L89686	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
L89685	u4078	m271	SCUD	Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
L89684	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
L89683	u4078	m271	SCUD	The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
L89682	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
L89681	u4078	m271	SCUD	Scud.
L89680	u4080	m271	WHISTLER	Tell me something, Skid --
L89499	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
L89498	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler, I --
L89494	u4081	m272	BLADE	No, we can treat the wounds --
L89493	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
L89492	u4081	m272	BLADE	Don't try to talk --
L89391	u4081	m272	BLADE	China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
L89390	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Going somewhere?
L89345	u4081	m272	BLADE	Don't even start, old man.
L89344	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	What took you so long?
L89183	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Wait.
L89182	u4081	m272	BLADE	Get in. You?re leaving.
L89164	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
L89163	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
L89162	u4081	m272	BLADE	Stupidity.
L89151	u4081	m272	BLADE	Just do it, old man.
L89150	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
L89126	u4081	m272	BLADE	She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
L89125	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You should've killed her, then.
L89124	u4081	m272	BLADE	She's been bitten.
L89123	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Are we bringing home strays now?
L89122	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler!
L89628	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's because I'm human that I can do this.
L89627	u4084	m272	FROST	You're too human, Blade.
L89625	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
L89624	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
L89623	u4081	m272	BLADE	Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
L89608	u4084	m272	FROST	Take him.
L89607	u4081	m272	BLADE	Who dies first?
L89606	u4081	m272	BLADE	Frost!!!
L89605	u4084	m272	FROST	No longer.
L89437	u4084	m272	FROST	Watch me.
L89436	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're not going anywhere.
L89432	u4084	m272	FROST	You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
L89431	u4081	m272	BLADE	Pass.
L89430	u4084	m272	FROST	The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
L89428	u4084	m272	FROST	Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
L89427	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're wrong.
L89426	u4084	m272	FROST	Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
L89425	u4081	m272	BLADE	Maybe I don't see it that way.
L89424	u4084	m272	FROST	Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
L89423	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't buy it.
L89422	u4084	m272	FROST	"It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, ""the Day-walker""."
L89421	u4084	m272	FROST	I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
L89420	u4081	m272	BLADE	How can you be out here?
L89419	u4084	m272	FROST	Beautiful day, isn't it?
L89488	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	You've been here longer than you think.
L89487	u4081	m272	BLADE	But I just got here --
L89486	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	I am tired. Dawn is coming.
L89484	u4081	m272	BLADE	How do I stop it?
L89483	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
L89482	u4081	m272	BLADE	The Blood Tide.
L89481	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	"The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  ""And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."""
L89478	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
L89477	u4081	m272	BLADE	Who is LaMagra?
L89476	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
L89474	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Show me.
L89473	u4081	m272	BLADE	I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
L89472	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Hold out your hands.
L89470	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	There are other ways to see. Sit.
L89469	u4081	m272	BLADE	You're blind --
L89468	u4087	m272	MIRACIA	Is something wrong, my friend?
L89631	u4081	m272	BLADE	For them. But for me --
L89630	u4086	m272	KAREN	I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
L89598	u4086	m272	KAREN	Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
L89597	u4081	m272	BLADE	I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
L89596	u4086	m272	KAREN	It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
L89595	u4081	m272	BLADE	No --
L89594	u4086	m272	KAREN	I know. Take some of my blood.
L89593	u4081	m272	BLADE	-- tearing me -- apart.
L89592	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't understand. The Thirst --
L89591	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm not leaving without you.
L89590	u4081	m272	BLADE	Get out of here --
L89544	u4081	m272	BLADE	What are you talking about?
L89543	u4086	m272	KAREN	It won't work on you.
L89542	u4081	m272	BLADE	We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
L89541	u4086	m272	KAREN	Is it bad?
L89540	u4086	m272	KAREN	I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
L89539	u4081	m272	BLADE	How long have we been driving?
L89538	u4081	m272	BLADE	I've been better --
L89537	u4086	m272	KAREN	Are you all right?
L89447	u4086	m272	KAREN	You make it sound like I'm already dead.
L89446	u4081	m272	BLADE	For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
L89442	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
L89441	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't look so good.
L89440	u4086	m272	KAREN	Some. It's been slow --
L89439	u4081	m272	BLADE	Any progress?
L89403	u4081	m272	BLADE	Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
L89402	u4086	m272	KAREN	My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
L89401	u4081	m272	BLADE	We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
L89400	u4086	m272	KAREN	You care about him, don't you?
L89399	u4081	m272	BLADE	Cancer.
L89398	u4086	m272	KAREN	Is he sick?
L89393	u4081	m272	BLADE	For your miracle cure?
L89392	u4086	m272	KAREN	I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
L89380	u4086	m272	KAREN	Blade --
L89379	u4081	m272	BLADE	Just get out of here.
L89378	u4086	m272	KAREN	If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
L89377	u4081	m272	BLADE	I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
L89376	u4086	m272	KAREN	Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
L89375	u4081	m272	BLADE	I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
L89373	u4081	m272	BLADE	You get used to the darkness.
L89372	u4086	m272	KAREN	It's dark in here.
L89341	u4081	m272	BLADE	Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
L89340	u4086	m272	KAREN	What am I injecting you with?
L89338	u4081	m272	BLADE	Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
L89337	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're hurt --
L89295	u4081	m272	BLADE	You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
L89294	u4086	m272	KAREN	Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
L89293	u4081	m272	BLADE	Some kind of archive --
L89292	u4086	m272	KAREN	What is this place?
L89284	u4081	m272	BLADE	Like me.
L89283	u4086	m272	KAREN	Like what?
L89282	u4081	m272	BLADE	There are worse things than vampires out there.
L89281	u4086	m272	KAREN	So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
L89279	u4081	m272	BLADE	The way they move, they way they smell --
L89278	u4086	m272	KAREN	How can you tell?
L89277	u4081	m272	BLADE	Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
L89270	u4081	m272	BLADE	He will.
L89269	u4086	m272	KAREN	You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
L89255	u4081	m272	BLADE	Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
L89254	u4086	m272	KAREN	I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
L89252	u4081	m272	BLADE	Look closer.
L89251	u4086	m272	KAREN	Graffiti --
L89250	u4081	m272	BLADE	What do you see here?
L89249	u4086	m272	KAREN	What are you looking at?
L89248	u4086	m272	KAREN	You don't know that.
L89247	u4081	m272	BLADE	There is no cure.
L89246	u4086	m272	KAREN	Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
L89231	u4081	m272	BLADE	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
L89230	u4086	m272	KAREN	You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
L89229	u4081	m272	BLADE	Preventive medicine.
L89228	u4086	m272	KAREN	What are you doing?!
L89223	u4081	m272	BLADE	For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
L89222	u4086	m272	KAREN	And that's a good thing?
L89221	u4081	m272	BLADE	Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
L89220	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
L89219	u4081	m272	BLADE	That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
L89218	u4081	m272	BLADE	He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
L89217	u4086	m272	KAREN	But he's a policeman --
L89216	u4081	m272	BLADE	He didn't. Get over it.
L89215	u4086	m272	KAREN	But, he could've --
L89214	u4081	m272	BLADE	It worked, didn't it?
L89213	u4086	m272	KAREN	You used me as bait?!
L89212	u4081	m272	BLADE	Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
L89211	u4086	m272	KAREN	How did you know?
L89180	u4086	m272	KAREN	That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
L89179	u4081	m272	BLADE	Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
L89178	u4086	m272	KAREN	I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
L89176	u4081	m272	BLADE	Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
L89175	u4086	m272	KAREN	I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
L89174	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
L89173	u4086	m272	KAREN	And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
L89167	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens then?
L89166	u4081	m272	BLADE	Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
L89165	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why?
L89158	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're joking --
L89157	u4081	m272	BLADE	-- he's a vampire.
L89153	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'm sorry, I --
L89152	u4081	m272	BLADE	You shouldn't be here.
L89411	u4085	m272	KAM	There's only one alternative to the serum.
L89410	u4081	m272	BLADE	Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
L89409	u4085	m272	KAM	I was afraid that might happen.
L89408	u4081	m272	BLADE	Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
L89407	u4081	m272	BLADE	I was in the neighborhood.
L89406	u4085	m272	KAM	You're a week early.
L89405	u4081	m272	BLADE	How's it going, Kam?
L89576	u4088	m272	VANESSA	You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
L89575	u4081	m272	BLADE	I don't believe that.
L89574	u4088	m272	VANESSA	I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
L89573	u4088	m272	VANESSA	You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
L89572	u4081	m272	BLADE	You don't have to be.
L89571	u4088	m272	VANESSA	These are my people now. I'm one of them.
L89570	u4081	m272	BLADE	How could you be a part of this?
L89534	u4088	m272	VANESSA	Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
L89533	u4081	m272	BLADE	Please --
L89529	u4081	m272	BLADE	Fight him --
L89528	u4088	m272	VANESSA	Deacon brought me back.
L89527	u4081	m272	BLADE	But you -- died --
L89116	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
L89115	u4086	m272	KAREN	-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
L89114	u4086	m272	KAREN	Sometimes --
L89113	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
L89112	u4082	m272	CURTIS	He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
L89111	u4086	m272	KAREN	What?
L89110	u4082	m272	CURTIS	That's weird --
L89109	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
L89108	u4086	m272	KAREN	You haven't started in on the internal organs?
L89107	u4082	m272	CURTIS	No problem.
L89106	u4086	m272	KAREN	"Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about ""us""."
L89105	u4082	m272	CURTIS	This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
L89104	u4086	m272	KAREN	I thought you promised to give me some distance?
L89103	u4082	m272	CURTIS	It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
L89102	u4086	m272	KAREN	Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
L89100	u4082	m272	CURTIS	What about the chemistry panel?
L89099	u4086	m272	KAREN	The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
L89098	u4086	m272	KAREN	I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
L89097	u4082	m272	CURTIS	Then what is it?
L89096	u4086	m272	KAREN	This isn't human blood.
L89386	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	The other elders will never let you get away with this!
L89385	u4084	m272	FROST	How do you like that? Right on time.
L89191	u4084	m272	FROST	Perhaps.
L89190	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
L89189	u4084	m272	FROST	Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
L89188	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
L89146	u4084	m272	FROST	Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
L89145	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
L89141	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	He is an abomination!
L89140	u4084	m272	FROST	Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
L89139	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	"I see. And what would you have us do with this ""half-breed""?"
L89138	u4084	m272	FROST	Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
L89137	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
L89136	u4084	m272	FROST	The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
L89135	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wrong, Dragonetti.
L89134	u4083	m272	DRAGONETTI	Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
L89621	u4086	m272	KAREN	Get away from him!
L89620	u4084	m272	FROST	I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
L89554	u4084	m272	FROST	You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
L89553	u4086	m272	KAREN	Blade --
L89520	u4084	m272	FROST	Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
L89519	u4086	m272	KAREN	You're a monster.
L89517	u4084	m272	FROST	Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
L89516	u4086	m272	KAREN	But you use blood banks --
L89515	u4084	m272	FROST	What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
L89514	u4086	m272	KAREN	There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
L89513	u4084	m272	FROST	Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
L89512	u4086	m272	KAREN	You.
L89511	u4084	m272	FROST	LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
L89510	u4084	m272	FROST	That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
L89509	u4086	m272	KAREN	LaMagra --
L89508	u4084	m272	FROST	The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
L89507	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens then?
L89506	u4084	m272	FROST	A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
L89505	u4086	m272	KAREN	How many of you are there?
L89462	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
L89461	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happened to the power?
L89460	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
L89459	u4086	m272	KAREN	On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
L89457	u4086	m272	KAREN	With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
L89456	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	How?
L89455	u4086	m272	KAREN	Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
L89453	u4086	m272	KAREN	Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
L89452	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
L89451	u4086	m272	KAREN	All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
L89370	u4086	m272	KAREN	I'll take my chances.
L89369	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
L89368	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
L89367	u4086	m272	KAREN	And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
L89366	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
L89365	u4086	m272	KAREN	How did you escape?
L89364	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
L89363	u4086	m272	KAREN	He killed them?
L89362	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
L89361	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Habit, mostly, just like this.
L89360	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why do you hunt them?
L89358	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
L89357	u4086	m272	KAREN	No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
L89356	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
L89355	u4086	m272	KAREN	What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
L89354	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
L89347	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	We weren't sure we could trust you.
L89346	u4086	m272	KAREN	Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
L89335	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Go on, I'll be fine!
L89334	u4086	m272	KAREN	Whistler!
L89332	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
L89331	u4086	m272	KAREN	You've been listening in the whole time?
L89330	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	We keep in radio contact.
L89186	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
L89185	u4086	m272	KAREN	So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
L89184	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
L89171	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
L89170	u4086	m272	KAREN	So what do you use, then? A stake?
L89156	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
L89155	u4086	m272	KAREN	Who are you people?
L89131	u4089	m272	WHISTLER	You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
L89130	u4086	m272	KAREN	What -- ?
L111291	u4249	m283	SAM	What have you done to my flat?
L111290	u4233	m283	DOWSER	... And then some.
L110862	u4249	m283	SAM	I fixed it myself.

L110676	u4234	m283	GENT	Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
L110675	u4249	m283	SAM	What? You mean you've got ...
L110674	u4234	m283	GENT	Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
L110673	u4234	m283	GENT	We know that too. You've come to the right place.
L110672	u4249	m283	SAM	Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
L110671	u4234	m283	GENT	We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
L110670	u4249	m283	SAM	What? How do you know my name?
L110669	u4234	m283	GENT	Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
L110881	u4235	m283	GIRL	Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
L110880	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
L110879	u4235	m283	GIRL	Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
L110878	u4249	m283	SAM	Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
L110877	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh, right ...
L110876	u4235	m283	GIRL	You don't have to sing it.
L110875	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
L110874	u4235	m283	GIRL	It's reply paid.
L110873	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... Thanks ...
L110822	u4249	m283	SAM	He will be pleased when he comes home.

L110819	u4236	m283	GIRL BUTTLE	Layton.
L110818	u4249	m283	SAM	What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
L110817	u4236	m283	GIRL BUTTLE	Her name is Jill.
L110816	u4249	m283	SAM	Go away.
L110508	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
L110507	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
L110506	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Beginner's luck.
L110505	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
L110504	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
L110503	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
L110501	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
L110500	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
L110499	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
L110498	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
L110497	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
L110496	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	In fact, killing people -
L110495	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
L110494	u4238	m283	INTERVIEWER	Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
L111382	u4249	m283	SAM	No, no ... I did that...
L111381	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
L111379	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
L111378	u4249	m283	SAM	Please, I've got to find Jill.
L111377	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
L111376	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
L111375	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
L111374	u4249	m283	SAM	This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
L111373	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
L111372	u4249	m283	SAM	Help me!
L111371	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
L111370	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
L111369	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Gillian Layton?
L111368	u4249	m283	SAM	Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
L111367	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
L110942	u4249	m283	SAM	Well ... well, I ...
L110941	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Too late? That's for me to say.
L110940	u4249	m283	SAM	Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
L110939	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
L110937	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
L110936	u4249	m283	SAM	Sorry ...
L110935	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, I ...
L110934	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	If I can help you ...
L110933	u4249	m283	SAM	That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
L110932	u4237	m283	HELPMANN	Thanks very much Sam.
L111399	u4239	m283	JACK	Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
L111398	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack ...
L111397	u4239	m283	JACK	How do you think I feel? You shit!
L111396	u4249	m283	SAM	Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
L111395	u4239	m283	JACK	How could you do this to me?
L111394	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L111393	u4239	m283	JACK	You stupid bastard!
L111392	u4249	m283	SAM	This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
L111391	u4239	m283	JACK	Bastard!!!
L111390	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
L111389	u4239	m283	JACK	Shut up!
L111388	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack?... Jack?
L111275	u4239	m283	JACK	Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
L111274	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes we have, Jack!
L111273	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
L111272	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack, she's innocent!
L111271	u4239	m283	JACK	There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
L111270	u4249	m283	SAM	It could all be coincidental.
L111269	u4239	m283	JACK	I do. Goodbye. 
L111268	u4249	m283	SAM	You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
L111267	u4239	m283	JACK	Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
L111266	u4249	m283	SAM	She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
L111265	u4239	m283	JACK	I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
L111264	u4249	m283	SAM	Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
L111087	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
L111086	u4249	m283	SAM	Trust me.
L111085	u4239	m283	JACK	Do you know what you're doing.
L111084	u4249	m283	SAM	Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
L111083	u4239	m283	JACK	Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
L111082	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
L111081	u4239	m283	JACK	We don't make mistakes.
L111080	u4249	m283	SAM	Say it was a mistake.
L111079	u4239	m283	JACK	There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
L111078	u4249	m283	SAM	Take her off the list.
L111077	u4239	m283	JACK	But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
L111076	u4249	m283	SAM	They weren't at school with us.
L111075	u4239	m283	JACK	Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
L111074	u4249	m283	SAM	Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
L111073	u4239	m283	JACK	You're the only person I can trust.
L111072	u4249	m283	SAM	And you're mine.
L111071	u4239	m283	JACK	Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
L111070	u4249	m283	SAM	Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
L111069	u4239	m283	JACK	What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
L111068	u4249	m283	SAM	Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
L111067	u4239	m283	JACK	Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
L111066	u4249	m283	SAM	You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
L111065	u4239	m283	JACK	Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
L111064	u4249	m283	SAM	So what are you going to do about her?
L111063	u4239	m283	JACK	Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
L111062	u4249	m283	SAM	Out of kindness.
L111061	u4239	m283	JACK	{baffled) I don't follow you.
L111060	u4249	m283	SAM	Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
L111059	u4239	m283	JACK	Why?
L111058	u4249	m283	SAM	Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
L111057	u4239	m283	JACK	Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
L111056	u4249	m283	SAM	Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
L111055	u4239	m283	JACK	Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
L111054	u4249	m283	SAM	But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
L111052	u4249	m283	SAM	A terrorist?
L111051	u4239	m283	JACK	She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
L111050	u4249	m283	SAM	Tell me about Layton.
L111049	u4239	m283	JACK	Yes. I'm impressed.
L111048	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
L111047	u4239	m283	JACK	Very smart.
L111046	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... no.
L111045	u4239	m283	JACK	You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
L111044	u4249	m283	SAM	What's she done?
L111043	u4239	m283	JACK	He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
L111042	u4249	m283	SAM	He's a freelance subversive?
L111041	u4239	m283	JACK	We suspect him of freelance subversion.
L111040	u4249	m283	SAM	What has Tuttle done?
L111039	u4239	m283	JACK	What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
L111038	u4249	m283	SAM	So how ...?
L111037	u4239	m283	JACK	There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
L111036	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm sure you have
L111035	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
L111034	u4249	m283	SAM	You killed him?
L111033	u4239	m283	JACK	I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
L111032	u4249	m283	SAM	You got the wrong man.
L111031	u4239	m283	JACK	Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
L111030	u4249	m283	SAM	No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
L111029	u4239	m283	JACK	Christ! You do know it all!
L111028	u4249	m283	SAM	B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
L111027	u4239	m283	JACK	OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
L111026	u4249	m283	SAM	Not really, no.
L111025	u4239	m283	JACK	Enough though, eh?
L111024	u4249	m283	SAM	Not much.
L111023	u4239	m283	JACK	How much do you know?
L111022	u4249	m283	SAM	How do you mean?
L111021	u4239	m283	JACK	Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
L111020	u4249	m283	SAM	Am I?
L111019	u4239	m283	JACK	You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
L111018	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L111017	u4239	m283	JACK	Layton! Oh shit!
L111016	u4249	m283	SAM	I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
L111015	u4239	m283	JACK	OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
L111014	u4249	m283	SAM	I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
L111013	u4239	m283	JACK	What?
L111012	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah ...
L111011	u4239	m283	JACK	Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
L111010	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, thanks.
L111009	u4239	m283	JACK	For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
L111008	u4249	m283	SAM	Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
L111007	u4239	m283	JACK	Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
L111006	u4249	m283	SAM	Are you officer 412/L?
L111005	u4239	m283	JACK	SAM! What a surprise!
L111004	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack!!
L110925	u4239	m283	JACK	Mr Helpmann!
L110924	u4249	m283	SAM	Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
L110923	u4239	m283	JACK	Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
L110920	u4249	m283	SAM	What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
L110919	u4239	m283	JACK	Remember how they used to stick out?
L110918	u4249	m283	SAM	Er, I knew you looked different.
L110917	u4239	m283	JACK	{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
L110913	u4239	m283	JACK	You remember Alison?
L110912	u4249	m283	SAM	Hello, Jack!
L110551	u4249	m283	SAM	Really? - God, how time flies!
L110550	u4239	m283	JACK	Triplets.
L110549	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
L110548	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
L110547	u4249	m283	SAM	Even later.
L110546	u4239	m283	JACK	You are late.
L110545	u4249	m283	SAM	Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
L110544	u4239	m283	JACK	What's the matter?
L110543	u4239	m283	JACK	Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
L110542	u4249	m283	SAM	You sound worried.
L110541	u4239	m283	JACK	Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
L110540	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
L110539	u4239	m283	JACK	Long time no see!
L110538	u4249	m283	SAM	Jack!
L110537	u4239	m283	JACK	Sam!
L111104	u4240	m283	JILL	Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
L111103	u4248	m283	PORTER	Oh.
L111102	u4240	m283	JILL	I bet you'd like to touch them?
L111101	u4248	m283	PORTER	Ah.
L111100	u4240	m283	JILL	You think these are tits don't you?
L111099	u4248	m283	PORTER	If you say so.
L111098	u4240	m283	JILL	You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
L111089	u4248	m283	PORTER	You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
L111088	u4240	m283	JILL	But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
L110561	u4248	m283	PORTER	Information Adjustments.
L110560	u4240	m283	JILL	Where do I get it stamped?
L110559	u4248	m283	PORTER	No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
L110558	u4240	m283	JILL	Stamped?
L110557	u4248	m283	PORTER	Is it stamped?
L110556	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.
L110555	u4248	m283	PORTER	Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
L110554	u4240	m283	JILL	I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
L110553	u4248	m283	PORTER	You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
L110552	u4240	m283	JILL	I want to report a wrongful arrest.
L111336	u4249	m283	SAM	You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
L111335	u4240	m283	JILL	What do you think? ... is it me?
L111323	u4240	m283	JILL	Take care.
L111322	u4249	m283	SAM	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L111321	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't do anything silly.
L111320	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
L111319	u4240	m283	JILL	Where are you going?
L111318	u4249	m283	SAM	Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
L111306	u4249	m283	SAM	C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
L111305	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't you like parties?
L111286	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.
L111285	u4249	m283	SAM	Are you sure?
L111284	u4240	m283	JILL	They're gone.
L111283	u4249	m283	SAM	No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
L111282	u4240	m283	JILL	Your face ... are you hurt?
L111281	u4249	m283	SAM	What happened to you after ...
L111280	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.
L111279	u4249	m283	SAM	Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
L111226	u4240	m283	JILL	No you're not!
L111225	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm going to open it!
L111224	u4240	m283	JILL	Oh ... Jesus!
L111223	u4249	m283	SAM	........... It's a bomb isn't it?
L111222	u4240	m283	JILL	I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
L111221	u4249	m283	SAM	I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
L111220	u4240	m283	JILL	You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
L111219	u4249	m283	SAM	You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
L111218	u4240	m283	JILL	Leave me alone!
L111217	u4249	m283	SAM	There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
L111216	u4240	m283	JILL	Go away.
L111215	u4249	m283	SAM	Please, Jill ... I love you.
L111214	u4240	m283	JILL	Are you still following me?
L111213	u4249	m283	SAM	This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
L111211	u4240	m283	JILL	Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
L111210	u4249	m283	SAM	Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
L111209	u4240	m283	JILL	What?
L111208	u4249	m283	SAM	And your children all gone.
L111207	u4240	m283	JILL	Shit! The house is on fire!
L111206	u4249	m283	SAM	It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
L111205	u4240	m283	JILL	We? Don't blame me!
L111204	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh God! What have we done?
L111203	u4240	m283	JILL	Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
L111201	u4240	m283	JILL	Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
L111200	u4249	m283	SAM	Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
L111199	u4240	m283	JILL	Let go! We've got to stop!
L111198	u4249	m283	SAM	I was right! Step on it!
L111196	u4240	m283	JILL	Stop it ... damn you!
L111195	u4249	m283	SAM	Turn!
L111194	u4240	m283	JILL	Get away!
L111193	u4249	m283	SAM	Will you please turn back.
L111192	u4240	m283	JILL	Cut it out, Sam.
L111191	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
L111190	u4240	m283	JILL	I thought you arrested me.
L111189	u4249	m283	SAM	No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
L111188	u4240	m283	JILL	You're joking.
L111187	u4249	m283	SAM	Security.
L111186	u4240	m283	JILL	Who will?
L111185	u4249	m283	SAM	They'll be there waiting.
L111184	u4240	m283	JILL	What?
L111183	u4249	m283	SAM	Turn around!
L111182	u4249	m283	SAM	Every day?
L111181	u4240	m283	JILL	Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
L111180	u4249	m283	SAM	What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
L111179	u4240	m283	JILL	Look at that - right on time.
L111178	u4249	m283	SAM	Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
L111177	u4240	m283	JILL	How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
L111176	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, terrorists of course.
L111175	u4240	m283	JILL	Who is this war against, Sam?
L111174	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, all wars do -
L111173	u4240	m283	JILL	Say, all wars have innocent victims.
L111172	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, no system is.
L111171	u4240	m283	JILL	Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
L111170	u4240	m283	JILL	They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
L111169	u4249	m283	SAM	Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
L111168	u4240	m283	JILL	We've got both.
L111167	u4249	m283	SAM	What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
L111166	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
L111165	u4249	m283	SAM	Suit me?
L111164	u4240	m283	JILL	I mean, it doesn't suit you.
L111163	u4249	m283	SAM	Really.
L111162	u4240	m283	JILL	No, really.
L111161	u4249	m283	SAM	Looking for you.
L111160	u4240	m283	JILL	What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
L111157	u4240	m283	JILL	A heavy Christmas present.
L111156	u4249	m283	SAM	It's heavy.
L111155	u4240	m283	JILL	What parcel?
L111154	u4249	m283	SAM	OK. What's in the parcel?
L111153	u4240	m283	JILL	What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
L111152	u4249	m283	SAM	What's going on here?
L111150	u4249	m283	SAM	Where are you taking me?
L111149	u4240	m283	JILL	It does doesn't it?
L111148	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
L111147	u4240	m283	JILL	Where are you taking me?
L111146	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L111145	u4240	m283	JILL	Where are you taking me?
L111144	u4240	m283	JILL	It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
L111143	u4249	m283	SAM	Why not?
L111142	u4240	m283	JILL	I didn't like it.
L111141	u4249	m283	SAM	Why?
L111140	u4240	m283	JILL	I didn't run away. I left the flat.
L111139	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
L111138	u4240	m283	JILL	I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
L111137	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, of course. Sorry.
L111136	u4240	m283	JILL	It's my fucking life.
L111135	u4249	m283	SAM	You know, smoking's bad for you.
L111134	u4249	m283	SAM	I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
L111133	u4240	m283	JILL	Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
L111132	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
L111131	u4240	m283	JILL	I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
L111130	u4249	m283	SAM	... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
L111129	u4249	m283	SAM	Oh, sorry.
L111128	u4240	m283	JILL	Don't litter my cab!
L111127	u4249	m283	SAM	Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
L111126	u4240	m283	JILL	Them?
L111125	u4249	m283	SAM	Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
L111124	u4249	m283	SAM	Please!
L111123	u4240	m283	JILL	No.
L111122	u4249	m283	SAM	Bloody hell! Do as I say!
L111120	u4240	m283	JILL	Who are you?
L111119	u4249	m283	SAM	What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
L111113	u4240	m283	JILL	Good!
L111112	u4249	m283	SAM	Ow! That hurt!
L111111	u4240	m283	JILL	How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
L111110	u4249	m283	SAM	Don't look back! Act naturally!
L111109	u4240	m283	JILL	Who are you? Let go!
L110812	u4240	m283	JILL	Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
L110811	u4249	m283	SAM	It's you ... it's you ...
L110810	u4240	m283	JILL	Are you alright?
L110842	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
L110841	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	It's what you wanted isn't it?
L110840	u4249	m283	SAM	What! Shit!
L110839	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	I did it for you.
L110838	u4249	m283	SAM	I never signed the form.
L110837	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
L110836	u4249	m283	SAM	I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
L110835	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
L110834	u4249	m283	SAM	I know that.
L110833	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
L110832	u4249	m283	SAM	You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
L110831	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	What's the matter?
L110830	u4249	m283	SAM	Damn! Blast!
L110828	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes.
L110827	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Can I forget it?
L110826	u4249	m283	SAM	I delivered it.
L110825	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
L110790	u4249	m283	SAM	Don't mention it. See you later.
L110789	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	You are good to me Sam.
L110788	u4249	m283	SAM	That's it.
L110787	u4249	m283	SAM	Here.
L110786	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
L110785	u4249	m283	SAM	Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
L110784	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
L110783	u4249	m283	SAM	Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
L110782	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Here. What do I do next?
L110779	u4249	m283	SAM	Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
L110778	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	What?
L110777	u4249	m283	SAM	You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
L110776	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
L110775	u4249	m283	SAM	Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
L110772	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	27156789/074328/K.
L110771	u4249	m283	SAM	There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
L110770	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Next of kin!
L110769	u4249	m283	SAM	Try next of kin.
L110768	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
L110767	u4249	m283	SAM	He is dead.
L110766	u4249	m283	SAM	Hang on.
L110765	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
L110764	u4249	m283	SAM	Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
L110763	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
L110762	u4249	m283	SAM	I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
L110761	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
L110760	u4249	m283	SAM	Tuttle?
L110759	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	The refund for Tuttle!
L110758	u4249	m283	SAM	A cheque.
L110578	u4249	m283	SAM	What a BITCH!
L110577	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
L110576	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	You've been promoted.
L110575	u4249	m283	SAM	Really.
L110574	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Would you really, Sam?
L110573	u4249	m283	SAM	I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
L110572	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	But if they did promote you
L110571	u4249	m283	SAM	Don't worry.
L110570	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
L110569	u4249	m283	SAM	Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
L110568	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Oh, good!
L110567	u4249	m283	SAM	Information Retrieval.
L110566	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Isn't it? Whose is it?
L110565	u4249	m283	SAM	It's not our mistake!
L110564	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Oh my God, a mistake!
L110563	u4249	m283	SAM	It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have ?31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
L110562	u4241	m283	KURTZMAN	Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
L111261	u4242	m283	LIME	Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
L111260	u4249	m283	SAM	Lime, I need to use your computer
L110990	u4249	m283	SAM	Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
L110989	u4242	m283	LIME	Hey - that's my desk!
L110982	u4242	m283	LIME	Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
L110981	u4249	m283	SAM	You haven't switched it on.
L110980	u4242	m283	LIME	Sod it, it's broken!
L110979	u4242	m283	LIME	You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
L110978	u4249	m283	SAM	What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
L110977	u4242	m283	LIME	This is your dream girl, is it?
L110976	u4249	m283	SAM	I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
L110975	u4242	m283	LIME	A woman eh? I see.
L110974	u4249	m283	SAM	Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
L110973	u4242	m283	LIME	I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
L110972	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes.
L110971	u4242	m283	LIME	You want to take my console into your office?
L110970	u4249	m283	SAM	I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
L110969	u4242	m283	LIME	What?
L110968	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
L110967	u4242	m283	LIME	Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
L110966	u4249	m283	SAM	Sam Lowry.
L110965	u4242	m283	LIME	No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
L111314	u4243	m283	MATTHEWS	There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
L111313	u4249	m283	SAM	How long will she he away?
L111312	u4243	m283	MATTHEWS	I won't be held responsible.
L111311	u4249	m283	SAM	Well, she's my mother, not yours.
L111310	u4243	m283	MATTHEWS	She didn't say anything about it to me.
L111309	u4249	m283	SAM	My mother said it would be all right.
L110633	u4244	m283	MOTHER	I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
L110632	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero une, crevettes ? la mayonaaise. 
L110619	u4250	m283	SPIRO	A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
L110618	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
L110604	u4244	m283	MOTHER	We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
L110603	u4250	m283	SPIRO	{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
L110602	u4244	m283	MOTHER	You remember Samuel, my son.
L110601	u4250	m283	SPIRO	I'm sorry but ...
L110600	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
L111411	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Not now ... please
L111410	u4249	m283	SAM	Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
L111409	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Sam!!! 
L110889	u4249	m283	SAM	Actually, I've decided ...
L110888	u4244	m283	MOTHER	It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
L110887	u4249	m283	SAM	I want to talk to him.
L110886	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
L110885	u4249	m283	SAM	Is Mr Helpmann here?
L110884	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
L110883	u4249	m283	SAM	Mother? Is that you?
L110659	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
L110658	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
L110657	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
L110650	u4249	m283	SAM	Mother!
L110649	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
L110641	u4244	m283	MOTHER	By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
L110640	u4249	m283	SAM	This isn't rare!
L110639	u4244	m283	MOTHER	What were we saying?
L110598	u4244	m283	MOTHER	It's something for executives.
L110597	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L110596	u4244	m283	MOTHER	I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
L110594	u4249	m283	SAM	You're not listening, mother.
L110593	u4244	m283	MOTHER	Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
L110581	u4244	m283	MOTHER	No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
L110580	u4249	m283	SAM	I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
L110809	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
L110808	u4249	m283	SAM	Uh ...
L110806	u4249	m283	SAM	Um ...
L110805	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	What have you done with his body?
L110804	u4249	m283	SAM	Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
L110803	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	My husband's dead, isn't he?
L110802	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
L110801	u4245	m283	MRS BUTTLE	Mistake?
L110800	u4249	m283	SAM	It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
L111233	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
L111232	u4249	m283	SAM	Er, yes ...
L111231	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
L111230	u4249	m283	SAM	I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
L111229	u4249	m283	SAM	Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
L110908	u4249	m283	SAM	I ... uh ...
L110907	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
L110906	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	I know, I know ...!
L110905	u4249	m283	SAM	Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
L110904	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
L110903	u4249	m283	SAM	Whatever happened to you?
L110648	u4249	m283	SAM	What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
L110647	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
L110635	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
L110634	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
L110629	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
L110628	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
L110627	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
L110615	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
L110614	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
L110613	u4246	m283	MRS TERRAIN	I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
L110686	u4249	m283	SAM	What? Who is this?
L110685	u4247	m283	PHONE VOICE	Put the phone down and your hands up.
L110684	u4249	m283	SAM	Who's that? 
L110683	u4247	m283	PHONE VOICE	Hello. Mr Lowry?
L110682	u4249	m283	SAM	Hello ... hello ...
L110668	u4247	m283	PHONE VOICE	Thank you for calling Cen -
L110667	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
L110666	u4247	m283	PHONE VOICE	Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
L110665	u4249	m283	SAM	This is an emergency!
L110664	u4247	m283	PHONE VOICE	Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
L110663	u4249	m283	SAM	Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
L111328	u4249	m283	SAM	Thank you, Dawson.
L111327	u4248	m283	PORTER	I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
L111326	u4249	m283	SAM	And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
L111325	u4248	m283	PORTER	I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
L111324	u4249	m283	SAM	Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
L110951	u4248	m283	PORTER	No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
L110950	u4249	m283	SAM	But I could be anybody.
L110949	u4248	m283	PORTER	No need, sir
L110948	u4249	m283	SAM	My I.D. cards.
L110947	u4248	m283	PORTER	No, sir.
L110946	u4249	m283	SAM	Er, don't you want to search me?
L110945	u4248	m283	PORTER	Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
L110944	u4249	m283	SAM	My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
L111408	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
L111407	u4249	m283	SAM	what? ... Oh ... 
L110623	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Numero, trois.
L110622	u4249	m283	SAM	I don't know which numero.
L110621	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Monsieur. Quel numero.
L110620	u4249	m283	SAM	A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
L110606	u4250	m283	SPIRO	Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
L110605	u4249	m283	SAM	Are we?
L111295	u4251	m283	SPOOR	It's a 27B/6 of course.
L111294	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L111289	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Thermostat's gone. And then some.
L111288	u4249	m283	SAM	For God's sake, what's happened?
L110868	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
L110867	u4249	m283	SAM	Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
L110860	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Who fixed your ducts?
L110859	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L110850	u4251	m283	SPOOR	It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
L110849	u4249	m283	SAM	What is it?
L110848	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Sign here please.
L110845	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Emergency procedures.
L110844	u4249	m283	SAM	What the - ? How did you - ?
L110741	u4251	m283	SPOOR	We'll be back.
L110740	u4249	m283	SAM	I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
L110739	u4251	m283	SPOOR	It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
L110738	u4251	m283	SPOOR	But we can get one.
L110737	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Not ... as such ...
L110736	u4249	m283	SAM	Have you got one or haven't you?
L110735	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Now look what you've done to him.
L110723	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Fixed itself.
L110722	u4249	m283	SAM	I mean it fixed itself.
L110720	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Fixed?
L110719	u4249	m283	SAM	No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
L110712	u4251	m283	SPOOR	Central Services.
L110711	u4249	m283	SAM	Yes?
L110750	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
L110749	u4249	m283	SAM	Thank you very much. How much will it...?
L110748	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Time to go.
L110747	u4249	m283	SAM	What do they want you or?
L110746	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
L110745	u4249	m283	SAM	Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
L110710	u4249	m283	SAM	No. Wait here.
L110709	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Are you expecting anyone?
L110707	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	No. But I can bypass it with one of these
L110706	u4249	m283	SAM	Can you fix it?
L110705	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
L110704	u4249	m283	SAM	Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
L110703	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
L110702	u4249	m283	SAM	The pace?
L110701	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
L110700	u4249	m283	SAM	Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
L110699	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
L110698	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
L110697	u4249	m283	SAM	Are you saying this is illegal?
L110696	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
L110694	u4249	m283	SAM	What?
L110693	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
L110692	u4249	m283	SAM	But ... I called Central Services.
L110691	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Ha!!
L110690	u4249	m283	SAM	Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
L110689	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
L110688	u4249	m283	SAM	What is this?  Who the hell are you?
L110687	u4252	m283	TUTTLE	Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
L123456	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
L123455	u4375	m290	ADONIS	Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
L123454	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
L123168	u4375	m290	ADONIS	I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
L123167	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Works for me.
L123155	u4375	m290	ADONIS	Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
L123154	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Have we reached the epi-center?
L123013	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	It's okay. Let her go.
L123012	u4375	m290	ADONIS	Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
L122943	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	You have to dial nine first.
L122942	u4375	m290	ADONIS	I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
L122941	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
L122937	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
L122936	u4375	m290	ADONIS	The crowd bought it.
L122859	u4375	m290	ADONIS	Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
L122858	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
L123460	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
L123459	u4375	m290	ADONIS	You know, nobody likes you...
L123444	u4377	m290	CACTUS	That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
L123195	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
L123194	u4375	m290	ADONIS	Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
L122986	u4377	m290	CACTUS	This looks promising...
L122985	u4375	m290	ADONIS	I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
L122954	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
L122953	u4375	m290	ADONIS	Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
L123525	u4376	m290	BROCK	I lied.
L123524	u4386	m290	SELINA	I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
L123520	u4376	m290	BROCK	We'll hunt him down together...
L123519	u4386	m290	SELINA	In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
L123518	u4376	m290	BROCK	You're serious?  You'd help me...
L123517	u4386	m290	SELINA	It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
L123516	u4376	m290	BROCK	This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
L123515	u4376	m290	BROCK	Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
L123514	u4386	m290	SELINA	Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
L123511	u4386	m290	SELINA	A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
L123510	u4376	m290	BROCK	Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
L123428	u4376	m290	BROCK	I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
L123427	u4386	m290	SELINA	No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
L123411	u4376	m290	BROCK	You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
L123410	u4386	m290	SELINA	Hmm. Not bad.
L123407	u4376	m290	BROCK	What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
L123406	u4386	m290	SELINA	Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
L123293	u4386	m290	SELINA	Uh Brock, today you are without me...
L123292	u4376	m290	BROCK	Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
L123291	u4386	m290	SELINA	At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
L123290	u4376	m290	BROCK	Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
L123289	u4386	m290	SELINA	"I got home fine. How's the ""warehouse."""
L123288	u4376	m290	BROCK	"Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was ""no extension in the Hut."" Whatever that means.."
L123145	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'm sure.
L123144	u4376	m290	BROCK	Are you sure?
L123143	u4386	m290	SELINA	"Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your ""warehouse."" I'll be okay..."
L123142	u4376	m290	BROCK	This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
L123141	u4386	m290	SELINA	Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
L123140	u4376	m290	BROCK	What's the matter?  What are you saying?
L123139	u4386	m290	SELINA	A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
L123138	u4386	m290	SELINA	No it's not.
L123137	u4376	m290	BROCK	What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
L123136	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
L123135	u4376	m290	BROCK	"So, did you see ""Seinfeld"" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh."
L123134	u4386	m290	SELINA	"Stop. We are not having a ""duality"" conversation. ""Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side."" Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying ""I have an inner strength"" or ""Deep down, I'm really ambitious."" ""One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night."" If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a ""duality"" conversation."
L123133	u4376	m290	BROCK	I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
L123132	u4376	m290	BROCK	You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
L123131	u4386	m290	SELINA	I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
L123130	u4376	m290	BROCK	Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
L123129	u4386	m290	SELINA	Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
L123128	u4376	m290	BROCK	What did you think?
L123127	u4386	m290	SELINA	You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
L123058	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'm not afraid. Are you?
L123057	u4376	m290	BROCK	There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
L123056	u4386	m290	SELINA	But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
L123055	u4376	m290	BROCK	Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
L123054	u4386	m290	SELINA	How heroic of you...
L123053	u4376	m290	BROCK	I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
L123052	u4386	m290	SELINA	You're probably right.
L123051	u4376	m290	BROCK	"I'll bet the butler's name wasn't ""Jeff."""
L123050	u4386	m290	SELINA	Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
L123049	u4376	m290	BROCK	What's the matter...
L123046	u4386	m290	SELINA	I wonder..
L123045	u4376	m290	BROCK	Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
L122922	u4386	m290	SELINA	I don't know. I can't remember.
L122921	u4376	m290	BROCK	Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
L122920	u4386	m290	SELINA	Guilty. I am.
L122919	u4376	m290	BROCK	You say that like an amnesia victim.
L122918	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
L122917	u4376	m290	BROCK	No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
L122916	u4386	m290	SELINA	In women?
L122915	u4376	m290	BROCK	He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
L123485	u4383	m290	LANE	What little boy doesn't?
L123484	u4376	m290	BROCK	I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
L123483	u4383	m290	LANE	But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
L123482	u4376	m290	BROCK	I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
L123481	u4383	m290	LANE	I've been looking for you.
L123430	u4376	m290	BROCK	It may be time to get the police involved...
L123429	u4383	m290	LANE	I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
L123426	u4383	m290	LANE	Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
L123425	u4376	m290	BROCK	Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
L123424	u4383	m290	LANE	We're waiting.
L123420	u4383	m290	LANE	Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
L123419	u4376	m290	BROCK	You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
L123415	u4383	m290	LANE	But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
L123414	u4376	m290	BROCK	You're kidding.
L123405	u4376	m290	BROCK	Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
L123404	u4383	m290	LANE	Selina, are you okay?
L123365	u4376	m290	BROCK	Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
L123364	u4383	m290	LANE	I better go report this in...
L123363	u4383	m290	LANE	I suppose she does.
L123362	u4376	m290	BROCK	She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
L123361	u4383	m290	LANE	A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
L123360	u4376	m290	BROCK	She has a real spirit.
L123359	u4383	m290	LANE	Selina Kyle...lovely person.
L123358	u4376	m290	BROCK	They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
L123357	u4383	m290	LANE	Women, huh?
L123296	u4383	m290	LANE	Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
L123295	u4376	m290	BROCK	Oh, how long have you had your own route?
L123294	u4383	m290	LANE	There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
L123588	u4376	m290	BROCK	Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
L123587	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Catwomen. Lots of them!
L123586	u4376	m290	BROCK	Wha-at?
L123585	u4377	m290	CACTUS	God, can you hear me!
L123537	u4376	m290	BROCK	Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
L123536	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
L123535	u4376	m290	BROCK	Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
L123531	u4376	m290	BROCK	Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
L123530	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
L123529	u4376	m290	BROCK	You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
L123606	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	"What about ""climbing in?"""
L123605	u4376	m290	BROCK	"The ""skylight?"" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight..."
L123604	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Even the skylight?
L123603	u4376	m290	BROCK	Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
L123602	u4376	m290	BROCK	Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
L123601	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
L123600	u4376	m290	BROCK	Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
L123599	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
L123598	u4376	m290	BROCK	You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
L123597	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Pass!
L123596	u4376	m290	BROCK	I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
L123595	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
L123594	u4376	m290	BROCK	My dog!
L123593	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
L123592	u4376	m290	BROCK	What do you want from me?
L123591	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Winning.
L123590	u4376	m290	BROCK	I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
L123171	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
L123170	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
L123169	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Yeah, this is better than rape.
L123106	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
L123105	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
L122991	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
L122990	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	What's the catch?
L122961	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	He didn't remember to roll up his window...
L122960	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Dat's gotta hurt!
L122939	u4377	m290	CACTUS	I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
L122938	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
L123494	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
L123493	u4377	m290	CACTUS	"My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the ""Wild"" side.."
L123464	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Absolutely.
L123463	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Car wash, Captain?
L123451	u4377	m290	CACTUS	I got her...
L123450	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
L123373	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
L123372	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
L123102	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
L123101	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
L123100	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	What did you say?
L123099	u4377	m290	CACTUS	God-damn..
L122995	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
L122994	u4377	m290	CACTUS	I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
L122973	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Why am I still troubled...
L122972	u4377	m290	CACTUS	Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
L122935	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
L122934	u4377	m290	CACTUS	"Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: ""I am the Law and I am the Danish..."""
L122865	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Well. I stand corrected.
L122864	u4377	m290	CACTUS	That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
L122863	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
L122849	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Well done, Cactus.
L122848	u4377	m290	CACTUS	"What a ""drag."""
L123371	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	I know.
L123370	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	I loved you.
L123369	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	"Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  ""Superhero"" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse..."
L123368	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
L123367	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
L123366	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
L123199	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
L123198	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
L123197	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
L123016	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
L123015	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	You like them, don't you, Boss.
L122971	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
L122970	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
L122958	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
L122957	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
L122853	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Now he'll be up all night...
L122852	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
L123492	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	You can't get away with..
L123491	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
L123462	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	"Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical ""missions""...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won."
L123461	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
L123458	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	"I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to ""get to the bottom"" of things. Trying to ""save the city."" It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore."
L123457	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
L123228	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	You've seen me...
L123227	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	You think so?...Selina?
L123226	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	I still have one left...
L123225	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
L123224	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
L123223	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
L123222	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	A superhero's job is to protect.. Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
L123221	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
L123220	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	"It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say ""I'm wearing no underwear""--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?"
L123219	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
L123011	u4378	m290	CAPTAIN GOD	And...your point?
L123010	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
L123385	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
L123384	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
L123383	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Save the City? I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
L123382	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
L123381	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	"Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some ""clues"" on this disc. I can't..."
L123380	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
L123379	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
L123378	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	For when the time comes..
L123377	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Men, huh?
L123376	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
L123320	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
L123319	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
L123248	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Whatever you say...Sis.
L123247	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
L123246	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Hello, Spooky.
L123007	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Spear.
L123006	u4379	m290	CATWOMAN	Spooky.
L123350	u4380	m290	FEMALE EXEC CAT	Ask me another one--
L123349	u4382	m290	HOUSECAT	What's the name of your child's best friend?
L123348	u4380	m290	FEMALE EXEC CAT	How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
L123347	u4382	m290	HOUSECAT	"You mean, ""Consuela"" is a good mother.."
L123346	u4380	m290	FEMALE EXEC CAT	I'm a good mother!
L123323	u4380	m290	FEMALE EXEC CAT	"Did you just say ""girls?"""
L123322	u4382	m290	HOUSECAT	You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
L123321	u4380	m290	FEMALE EXEC CAT	You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
L123044	u4381	m290	FRANK	Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
L123043	u4386	m290	SELINA	"What if I were to say ""Your Wife""-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?"
L123042	u4381	m290	FRANK	"What if I were to say ""You're Fired?"""
L123041	u4386	m290	SELINA	Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
L123040	u4381	m290	FRANK	Hey, you're anti-male.
L123039	u4386	m290	SELINA	Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
L123038	u4381	m290	FRANK	"Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's ""sexual harassment..."""
L123037	u4386	m290	SELINA	Stop.
L123036	u4381	m290	FRANK	"There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some..""positions"" opening up.."
L122903	u4381	m290	FRANK	"Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's ""sexual harassment"" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman..."
L122902	u4386	m290	SELINA	Pre-bicentennial babe?
L122901	u4381	m290	FRANK	You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
L122891	u4386	m290	SELINA	What's the good news?
L122890	u4381	m290	FRANK	You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
L123433	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'll let you know.
L123432	u4383	m290	LANE	We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
L123431	u4386	m290	SELINA	Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
L123423	u4383	m290	LANE	Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
L123422	u4386	m290	SELINA	You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
L123418	u4386	m290	SELINA	Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
L123417	u4383	m290	LANE	Not too cool...
L123416	u4386	m290	SELINA	"Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's ""You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean ""warehouse."""
L123413	u4386	m290	SELINA	"Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  ""My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."""
L123412	u4383	m290	LANE	Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
L123409	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
L123408	u4383	m290	LANE	Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
L123276	u4383	m290	LANE	Uh-huh..
L123275	u4386	m290	SELINA	You are...
L123274	u4383	m290	LANE	You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
L123273	u4386	m290	SELINA	I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
L123272	u4383	m290	LANE	You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
L123271	u4386	m290	SELINA	"Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, ""A superhero's job is to protect..."""
L123270	u4383	m290	LANE	"I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a ""Month of the Woman"" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could..."
L123269	u4386	m290	SELINA	Hey, I thought...
L123268	u4383	m290	LANE	"I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with ""Brock Leviathan, architect.""  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine..."
L123267	u4386	m290	SELINA	I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
L123266	u4383	m290	LANE	I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
L123265	u4386	m290	SELINA	Like you don't know...
L123264	u4383	m290	LANE	About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
L123263	u4386	m290	SELINA	Nothing. How's your hand?
L123262	u4383	m290	LANE	What?
L123261	u4386	m290	SELINA	Did you try to kill...
L123260	u4383	m290	LANE	Actually, yes.
L123259	u4386	m290	SELINA	Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
L123258	u4383	m290	LANE	"Yes, you shouted the words ""Captain God"" at me for no reason..."
L123257	u4386	m290	SELINA	You turned around!
L123256	u4383	m290	LANE	What did--?
L123255	u4386	m290	SELINA	Hey, Captain God!
L123254	u4383	m290	LANE	I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
L123253	u4386	m290	SELINA	Next time, call...
L123252	u4386	m290	SELINA	Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
L123251	u4383	m290	LANE	No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
L123250	u4386	m290	SELINA	Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
L123249	u4383	m290	LANE	Good morning.
L123086	u4383	m290	LANE	Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
L123085	u4386	m290	SELINA	I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
L123084	u4383	m290	LANE	I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
L123083	u4386	m290	SELINA	But of course you are.
L123082	u4383	m290	LANE	Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
L123081	u4383	m290	LANE	Oh now this one is mine...
L123080	u4386	m290	SELINA	Enough.
L123079	u4383	m290	LANE	How much?
L123078	u4386	m290	SELINA	I actually got some memory back last night.
L123077	u4383	m290	LANE	Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
L123076	u4383	m290	LANE	Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
L123075	u4386	m290	SELINA	Yeah, she's okay.
L123074	u4383	m290	LANE	What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
L123073	u4386	m290	SELINA	I don't know what came over me.
L122925	u4386	m290	SELINA	"Uh. ""Thanks?"""
L122924	u4383	m290	LANE	"A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in ""Frank's Fun Palace"" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter.."
L123398	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'll go out with you. Now go get me these old newspapers...
L123397	u4384	m290	LIBRARY CLERK	Okay, deal.
L123396	u4386	m290	SELINA	What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
L123395	u4384	m290	LIBRARY CLERK	It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
L123394	u4386	m290	SELINA	But I'm blind.
L123393	u4384	m290	LIBRARY CLERK	I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
L123556	u4385	m290	MOM	Trust me, you won't have to.
L123555	u4386	m290	SELINA	I don't know if I can do it alone.
L123554	u4385	m290	MOM	Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
L123553	u4386	m290	SELINA	But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
L123552	u4385	m290	MOM	Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
L123551	u4386	m290	SELINA	Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
L123550	u4385	m290	MOM	I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
L123549	u4386	m290	SELINA	They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
L123543	u4385	m290	MOM	Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
L123542	u4386	m290	SELINA	I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
L123541	u4385	m290	MOM	"What kind of name is ""Brock Leviathan?"""
L123540	u4386	m290	SELINA	Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
L123026	u4386	m290	SELINA	It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
L123025	u4385	m290	MOM	Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
L122887	u4385	m290	MOM	"Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that ""Hag"" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor."
L122886	u4386	m290	SELINA	Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
L122885	u4385	m290	MOM	Don't sneak up on me...
L122883	u4385	m290	MOM	Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
L122882	u4386	m290	SELINA	I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
L122879	u4386	m290	SELINA	Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
L122878	u4385	m290	MOM	"It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. ""Absolutely nothing""-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?"
L122877	u4386	m290	SELINA	Maybe.
L122876	u4385	m290	MOM	"Is every single thing out of your mouth since your ""accident"" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?"
L122875	u4386	m290	SELINA	Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
L122874	u4385	m290	MOM	Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
L122873	u4386	m290	SELINA	A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
L122872	u4386	m290	SELINA	Yes, Mother. Dear.
L122871	u4385	m290	MOM	You're late.
L123314	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	Thanks.
L123313	u4386	m290	SELINA	Nice breasts.
L123311	u4386	m290	SELINA	You going to talk all day?
L123310	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
L123304	u4386	m290	SELINA	The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
L123303	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
L123302	u4386	m290	SELINA	You seem sad, Spooky.
L123301	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
L123300	u4386	m290	SELINA	What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
L123299	u4386	m290	SELINA	Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
L123298	u4387	m290	SPOOKY	I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
L123297	u4386	m290	SELINA	What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
L149159	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
L149158	u4703	m311	TORRES	What in the hell... do you call that?
L149157	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Who ever made that.
L149156	u4703	m311	TORRES	And you're gonna tell me who.
L149155	u4703	m311	TORRES	Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
L149154	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
L149153	u4703	m311	TORRES	Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
L149152	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
L149151	u4703	m311	TORRES	You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
L149150	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
L149028	u4692	m311	ELLY	They make you fart.
L149027	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	No onions?
L149026	u4692	m311	ELLY	No onions though, okay?
L149025	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	I'm buying.
L149024	u4692	m311	ELLY	You buying?
L149023	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Care for a hot dog?
L149022	u4692	m311	ELLY	Talent. Hi.
L149262	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Thanks, babe.
L149261	u4690	m311	ANNABELLA	Don't thank me.
L149260	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Well, hello there...chocolate,
L149259	u4690	m311	ANNABELLA	You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
L149258	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Could be.
L149254	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	I knew that.
L149253	u4690	m311	ANNABELLA	Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
L149233	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
L149232	u4690	m311	ANNABELLA	"Just don't tell me you ""owe me one.""  What file?"
L149231	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	This is special, darlin'.  Please?
L149230	u4690	m311	ANNABELLA	Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
L149229	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Annie, I need a file.
L149228	u4690	m311	ANNABELLA	Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
L149524	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
L149523	u4693	m311	ERIC	Don't interfere.
L149522	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
L149521	u4693	m311	ERIC	Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
L149520	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You're welcome.
L149519	u4693	m311	ERIC	This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
L149518	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You sorta looked like you might need my help.
L149437	u4693	m311	ERIC	No.  I have one more thing to do.
L149436	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	How 'bout the morgue?
L149435	u4693	m311	ERIC	They couldn't do anything for me.
L149434	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
L149433	u4693	m311	ERIC	I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
L149429	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
L149428	u4693	m311	ERIC	It's only a flesh wound.
L149427	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
L149426	u4693	m311	ERIC	Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
L149425	u4693	m311	ERIC	It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
L149323	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
L149322	u4693	m311	ERIC	Thank you.  For giving a damn.
L149321	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	I should be trying to stop you.
L149320	u4693	m311	ERIC	Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
L149319	u4693	m311	ERIC	Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
L149318	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	I'm sorry as hell, man.
L149317	u4693	m311	ERIC	My name.
L149315	u4693	m311	ERIC	The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
L149314	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
L149312	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
L149311	u4693	m311	ERIC	I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
L149310	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
L149308	u4693	m311	ERIC	I saw it, too.
L149307	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
L149197	u4693	m311	ERIC	The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
L149196	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Fucking A, my friend.
L149195	u4693	m311	ERIC	I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
L149194	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	You don't say.
L149193	u4693	m311	ERIC	"Listen:  Top Dollar.  He ""owns the street here.""  He will ""erase my ass."""
L149191	u4693	m311	ERIC	You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
L149190	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
L149188	u4689	m311	ALBRECHT	No further.  I'm serious.
L149187	u4693	m311	ERIC	And I say I'm dead... and I move.
L149551	u4692	m311	ELLY	It can't rain all the time.
L149550	u4691	m311	DARLA	At least it finally stopped raining.
L149476	u4691	m311	DARLA	We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
L149475	u4692	m311	ELLY	He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
L149474	u4691	m311	DARLA	I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
L149093	u4692	m311	ELLY	I lost my key.
L149092	u4691	m311	DARLA	I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
L149091	u4692	m311	ELLY	Mom --?
L149273	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	Not me.
L149272	u4691	m311	DARLA	Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
L149271	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	It's just the dope, don't worry
L149270	u4691	m311	DARLA	Fun -- look at that guy...
L149269	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
L149095	u4691	m311	DARLA	Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
L149094	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
L149545	u4692	m311	ELLY	You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
L149544	u4693	m311	ERIC	I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
L149543	u4692	m311	ELLY	You're not gonna come back, are you?
L149542	u4693	m311	ERIC	In a better place.  I hope.
L149541	u4692	m311	ELLY	Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
L149472	u4692	m311	ELLY	And she'll be alive.  Up here.
L149471	u4693	m311	ERIC	Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
L149468	u4693	m311	ERIC	I think he's yours, now.
L149467	u4692	m311	ELLY	I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
L149462	u4693	m311	ERIC	Elly...
L149461	u4692	m311	ELLY	She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
L149460	u4693	m311	ERIC	You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
L149457	u4693	m311	ERIC	A remembrance.  A closure.
L149456	u4692	m311	ELLY	What's going on...?
L149248	u4693	m311	ERIC	I have to go.
L149247	u4692	m311	ELLY	You gotta go now, I bet.
L149246	u4693	m311	ERIC	No.
L149245	u4692	m311	ELLY	Do you feel okay.
L149243	u4692	m311	ELLY	No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
L149242	u4693	m311	ERIC	Does she have a name?
L149241	u4692	m311	ELLY	"Can you play ""Teddy Bears' Picnic?""  It used to be her favorite."
L149240	u4693	m311	ERIC	I can pick out a tune now and again.
L149238	u4692	m311	ELLY	He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
L149237	u4693	m311	ERIC	Mister Funboy lives there?
L149236	u4692	m311	ELLY	Mister Funboy.
L149235	u4693	m311	ERIC	Who?
L149234	u4692	m311	ELLY	My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
L149214	u4693	m311	ERIC	I dabble.  May I?
L149213	u4692	m311	ELLY	You look like a rock star without a job.
L149363	u4698	m311	MICKEY	Oh.
L149362	u4692	m311	ELLY	Mom tried to cook.
L149361	u4698	m311	MICKEY	Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
L149032	u4692	m311	ELLY	She's still dead.
L149031	u4698	m311	MICKEY	Well, how's your friend?
L149030	u4692	m311	ELLY	I went to see a friend of mine.
L149029	u4698	m311	MICKEY	What's goin' on, Elly?
L149375	u4696	m311	GRANGE	I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
L149374	u4692	m311	ELLY	You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
L149373	u4692	m311	ELLY	Right.
L149372	u4696	m311	GRANGE	I'm looking for a good guitar man.
L149371	u4692	m311	ELLY	You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
L149370	u4696	m311	GRANGE	I'd like to get in touch with him.
L149369	u4692	m311	ELLY	I don't know you.
L149368	u4696	m311	GRANGE	I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
L149137	u4693	m311	ERIC	Victims.  Aren't we all.
L149136	u4701	m311	TIN-TIN	Holy shit... you're dead, man...
L149135	u4701	m311	TIN-TIN	I don't know you...
L149134	u4693	m311	ERIC	I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
L149133	u4701	m311	TIN-TIN	Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
L149132	u4693	m311	ERIC	You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
L149131	u4701	m311	TIN-TIN	Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
L149130	u4693	m311	ERIC	A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
L149127	u4693	m311	ERIC	Murderer.
L149126	u4701	m311	TIN-TIN	Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
L149410	u4693	m311	ERIC	Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
L149409	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
L149408	u4693	m311	ERIC	You don't even remember...
L149407	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
L149406	u4693	m311	ERIC	It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
L149405	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	That's ancient history.
L149404	u4693	m311	ERIC	A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
L149403	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	Take the dope, too.
L149402	u4693	m311	ERIC	Do you know what you destroyed?
L149401	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
L149400	u4693	m311	ERIC	Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
L149180	u4693	m311	ERIC	A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
L149179	u4695	m311	GIDEON	Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
L149178	u4693	m311	ERIC	T-Bird?
L149177	u4695	m311	GIDEON	You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
L149176	u4693	m311	ERIC	Another jolly nickname?
L149175	u4695	m311	GIDEON	Top Dollar.
L149170	u4693	m311	ERIC	Wrong answer.
L149169	u4695	m311	GIDEON	I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
L149168	u4693	m311	ERIC	Cute nickname, don't you think?
L149535	u4697	m311	LAO	I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
L149534	u4693	m311	ERIC	And how many lives have you destroyed?
L149512	u4697	m311	LAO	I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
L149511	u4693	m311	ERIC	You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
L149510	u4697	m311	LAO	Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
L149509	u4697	m311	LAO	I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
L149508	u4693	m311	ERIC	I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
L149507	u4697	m311	LAO	I wish to possess what you have now.
L149501	u4697	m311	LAO	Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
L149500	u4693	m311	ERIC	I can see her.
L149499	u4697	m311	LAO	I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
L149293	u4693	m311	ERIC	Your pain ends now.
L149292	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
L149290	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
L149289	u4693	m311	ERIC	Does it hurt?
L149288	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
L149285	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
L149284	u4693	m311	ERIC	Neither.
L149282	u4693	m311	ERIC	Magic.
L149281	u4694	m311	FUNBOY	How the hell did you do that?
L149497	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Very well, it's your ass.
L149496	u4693	m311	ERIC	Don't waste my time.
L149492	u4693	m311	ERIC	I'm already alone.
L149491	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	You'll be alone.
L149490	u4693	m311	ERIC	Fine with me.
L149489	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
L149488	u4693	m311	ERIC	Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
L149487	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
L149299	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Maybe I was wrong about you.
L149298	u4693	m311	ERIC	Shut up.
L149297	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
L149296	u4693	m311	ERIC	Go away.
L149295	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
L149143	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
L149142	u4693	m311	ERIC	Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
L149141	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Glad to see you're finally with the program.
L149115	u4693	m311	ERIC	Leave me alone -- !
L149114	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Get it?
L149111	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
L149110	u4693	m311	ERIC	Yes.
L149109	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Miss her?
L149108	u4693	m311	ERIC	Shelly?
L149107	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
L149034	u4699	m311	SKULL COWBOY	Interested?  Follow the crow.
L149033	u4693	m311	ERIC	What the hell are you?
L149079	u4700	m311	T-BIRD	Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
L149078	u4695	m311	GIDEON	What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
L149077	u4700	m311	T-BIRD	Leather purse...
L149076	u4695	m311	GIDEON	Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
L149075	u4700	m311	T-BIRD	...necklace... pearls...
L149074	u4695	m311	GIDEON	18k.  Crap.
L149073	u4700	m311	T-BIRD	Coupla more rings... 24k.
L149071	u4700	m311	T-BIRD	Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
L149070	u4695	m311	GIDEON	Blow yourself, bigmouth.
L149506	u4696	m311	GRANGE	Move in, guys.
L149505	u4697	m311	LAO	No shooting.
L149504	u4696	m311	GRANGE	I've got him if you want him.
L149494	u4697	m311	LAO	Is he inside?
L149493	u4696	m311	GRANGE	We've got company.
L149453	u4696	m311	GRANGE	Kill a dead guy?
L149452	u4697	m311	LAO	Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
L149450	u4696	m311	GRANGE	Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
L149449	u4697	m311	LAO	Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
L149448	u4696	m311	GRANGE	Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
L149447	u4697	m311	LAO	Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
L149446	u4696	m311	GRANGE	Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
L149445	u4697	m311	LAO	I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
L149444	u4696	m311	GRANGE	Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
L149443	u4697	m311	LAO	Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
L149442	u4696	m311	GRANGE	That thing is poisonous.
L149441	u4697	m311	LAO	This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
L149440	u4696	m311	GRANGE	What... the hell is that?
L149327	u4696	m311	GRANGE	No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
L149326	u4697	m311	LAO	Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
L149389	u4697	m311	LAO	Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
L149388	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
L149387	u4697	m311	LAO	Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
L149382	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	The night is young.
L149381	u4697	m311	LAO	Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
L149380	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	Our Crow...?
L149379	u4697	m311	LAO	"Sounds like our ""Crow"" is out-maneuvering you."
L149226	u4697	m311	LAO	To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
L149225	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
L149224	u4697	m311	LAO	I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
L149223	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
L149222	u4697	m311	LAO	"I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The ""hit""."
L149221	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
L149220	u4697	m311	LAO	Who got himself what?
L149219	u4702	m311	TOP DOLLAR	Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
L149218	u4697	m311	LAO	An unexpected pleasure.
L151064	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
L151063	u4718	m313	ALICE	How?
L151062	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
L151056	u4718	m313	ALICE	I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
L151055	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	What do you mean?
L151054	u4718	m313	ALICE	Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
L151024	u4718	m313	ALICE	It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year ? St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
L151023	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
L151022	u4718	m313	ALICE	I love the smell of pine.
L150973	u4718	m313	ALICE	No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
L150972	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Does she go up to the Farren's often?
L150784	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	But quite harmless, I'm sure.
L150783	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
L150782	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
L150769	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday ? about Oliver's first marriage ? and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy ? although he'll never realize it.
L150768	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
L150767	u4718	m313	ALICE	We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
L150766	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	But you don't keep a cat, do you?
L150765	u4718	m313	ALICE	But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
L150761	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
L150760	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
L150756	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
L150755	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, hello.
L150556	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	I'd love to.
L150555	u4718	m313	ALICE	I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
L150524	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
L150523	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
L150971	u4718	m313	ALICE	All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
L150970	u4719	m313	AMY	But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
L150969	u4718	m313	ALICE	Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
L150968	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
L150913	u4719	m313	AMY	You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
L150912	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, thank you, darling.
L150858	u4719	m313	AMY	All right, mommy.
L150857	u4718	m313	ALICE	Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
L150856	u4719	m313	AMY	Irena.
L150855	u4718	m313	ALICE	Irena.
L150854	u4719	m313	AMY	What's her name?
L150853	u4718	m313	ALICE	She was very pretty.
L150852	u4719	m313	AMY	It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
L150851	u4718	m313	ALICE	Where'd you get this, darling?
L150847	u4719	m313	AMY	I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
L150846	u4718	m313	ALICE	Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
L150739	u4718	m313	ALICE	Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
L150738	u4719	m313	AMY	But it's already come true.
L150737	u4718	m313	ALICE	You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
L150736	u4719	m313	AMY	I got my wish anyway.
L150735	u4718	m313	ALICE	Well ? the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
L150734	u4718	m313	ALICE	I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
L150733	u4719	m313	AMY	Are they nice?
L150732	u4718	m313	ALICE	No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
L150731	u4719	m313	AMY	Do you know the people?
L150730	u4718	m313	ALICE	The Farren house
L150729	u4719	m313	AMY	On the back street ? a green house
L150728	u4718	m313	ALICE	Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
L150727	u4719	m313	AMY	At the old house with the voice.
L150726	u4718	m313	ALICE	But where did you get it, Amy?
L150725	u4719	m313	AMY	That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
L150724	u4718	m313	ALICE	Where did you get this ring?
L150723	u4719	m313	AMY	I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
L150722	u4718	m313	ALICE	Sometimes.
L150721	u4719	m313	AMY	Did your wishes ever come true?
L150720	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, lots of times.
L150719	u4719	m313	AMY	Did you ever make a wish?
L150718	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes, darling.
L150717	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy --
L150716	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oh, you'll remember it some time.
L150715	u4719	m313	AMY	The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
L150714	u4718	m313	ALICE	What song, dear?
L150712	u4718	m313	ALICE	I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
L150711	u4719	m313	AMY	I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
L150710	u4718	m313	ALICE	What are saying, darling?
L150616	u4719	m313	AMY	I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself ? tell the truth --
L150615	u4718	m313	ALICE	But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
L150613	u4719	m313	AMY	You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
L150612	u4718	m313	ALICE	You get your wish!
L151035	u4726	m313	OLIVER	We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
L151034	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
L150896	u4726	m313	OLIVER	That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
L150895	u4718	m313	ALICE	What's funny?
L150864	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I suppose so.
L150863	u4718	m313	ALICE	Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
L150862	u4718	m313	ALICE	Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
L150861	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where did you get it?
L150849	u4718	m313	ALICE	Well, you know where it is.
L150848	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I haven't had my breakfast.
L150845	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
L150844	u4718	m313	ALICE	It's your play.
L150843	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What?
L150842	u4718	m313	ALICE	Ollie.
L150839	u4718	m313	ALICE	I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
L150838	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What is it, Alice?
L150691	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
L150690	u4718	m313	ALICE	You're shouting at me.
L150689	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm never unfair.
L150688	u4718	m313	ALICE	You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
L150687	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Well, it seemed to me --
L150686	u4718	m313	ALICE	Did you hear the child out?
L150683	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy's been lying again.
L150682	u4718	m313	ALICE	My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
L150588	u4718	m313	ALICE	But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
L150587	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
L150586	u4718	m313	ALICE	What do you mean?
L150585	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Something's haywire,
L150584	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's right.
L150583	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I think I should.  3000W?
L150582	u4718	m313	ALICE	All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
L150581	u4726	m313	OLIVER	No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
L150580	u4718	m313	ALICE	Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
L150579	u4718	m313	ALICE	Times have changed.
L150578	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
L150577	u4718	m313	ALICE	Yes, darling,
L150576	u4726	m313	OLIVER	It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
L150575	u4718	m313	ALICE	It's early yet.
L150574	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where is everybody?
L150573	u4718	m313	ALICE	I forgot I had it on.
L150572	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
L150552	u4718	m313	ALICE	Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
L150551	u4726	m313	OLIVER	"You make me sound like the father in ""East Lynne."""
L150550	u4718	m313	ALICE	I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today ? let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
L150549	u4726	m313	OLIVER	No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
L150548	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
L150547	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I know that.
L150546	u4718	m313	ALICE	I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
L150545	u4726	m313	OLIVER	All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
L150544	u4718	m313	ALICE	She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
L150543	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'd hate her to grow up like that.
L150541	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
L150540	u4718	m313	ALICE	I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
L150539	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
L150781	u4718	m313	ALICE	You do that, Edward.
L150780	u4721	m313	EDWARD	She said something about that, Mrs. Reed ? but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
L150779	u4718	m313	ALICE	But I told her to go with you.
L150778	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
L150777	u4718	m313	ALICE	That's the Farren house.
L150776	u4721	m313	EDWARD	No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
L150775	u4718	m313	ALICE	I thought you were with Amy.
L150967	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
L150966	u4719	m313	AMY	I got lots of presents.
L150752	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
L150751	u4719	m313	AMY	I live right here.
L150750	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
L150749	u4719	m313	AMY	Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
L150748	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Hello, Amy.
L150535	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
L150534	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
L150533	u4719	m313	AMY	It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
L151150	u4719	m313	AMY	Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
L151149	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Yes, darling.
L151148	u4719	m313	AMY	Daddy?
L151138	u4719	m313	AMY	She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
L151137	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But there's no one here, darling.
L151136	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
L151049	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
L151048	u4719	m313	AMY	But...
L151047	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
L151046	u4719	m313	AMY	But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
L151045	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
L151044	u4719	m313	AMY	Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
L151043	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
L151042	u4719	m313	AMY	She's there, just like I said she'd be.
L151038	u4719	m313	AMY	She's there whenever I call her!
L151037	u4726	m313	OLIVER	In the garden? Would she be there now?
L151036	u4719	m313	AMY	It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
L151033	u4719	m313	AMY	Because she is my friend.
L151032	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
L151030	u4719	m313	AMY	Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
L151029	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Yes, Amy?
L151028	u4719	m313	AMY	Daddy!
L150920	u4726	m313	OLIVER	This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
L150919	u4719	m313	AMY	She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
L150918	u4726	m313	OLIVER	And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
L150917	u4719	m313	AMY	Just you wait!
L150911	u4726	m313	OLIVER	"This one says, ""To Mother from Amy."""
L150910	u4719	m313	AMY	These are all from me.
L150693	u4719	m313	AMY	You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
L150692	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
L150685	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Voices from an old dark house!
L150684	u4719	m313	AMY	No, I didn't.
L150681	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Let me be the judge of that.
L150680	u4719	m313	AMY	Daddy, it's true.
L150679	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories ? I'm sick of this sort of thing.
L150678	u4719	m313	AMY	It was just a voice.
L150677	u4726	m313	OLIVER	And who did the voice belong to?
L150676	u4719	m313	AMY	It's true.
L150675	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Now Amy
L150674	u4719	m313	AMY	I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
L150673	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Why didn't you run after them?
L150672	u4719	m313	AMY	They ran away.
L150671	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
L150670	u4719	m313	AMY	It was on account of the birthday party.
L150669	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
L150668	u4719	m313	AMY	But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
L150667	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Can't you tell me later?
L150666	u4719	m313	AMY	I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
L150665	u4726	m313	OLIVER	What do you want. Amy?
L150611	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But this is different.  Go on blow,
L150610	u4719	m313	AMY	But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
L150609	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Certain wishes do.
L150608	u4719	m313	AMY	But wishes don't come true.
L150607	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
L150602	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
L150601	u4719	m313	AMY	I didn't forget.
L150600	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
L150599	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, daddy.
L150598	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, not that old tree!
L150597	u4719	m313	AMY	I'll show you.
L150596	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Where did you mail them?
L150595	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, I did.
L150594	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Did you mail then?
L150593	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, daddy.
L150592	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
L150567	u4726	m313	OLIVER	You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
L150566	u4719	m313	AMY	Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
L150940	u4719	m313	AMY	Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
L150939	u4723	m313	LOIS	We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
L150938	u4719	m313	AMY	No.
L150937	u4723	m313	LOIS	My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
L150936	u4719	m313	AMY	I don't know yet.
L150935	u4723	m313	LOIS	What'd you get for Christmas?
L151131	u4722	m313	IRENA	Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
L151130	u4719	m313	AMY	But why?
L151129	u4722	m313	IRENA	Yes, Amy.
L151128	u4719	m313	AMY	You?
L151127	u4722	m313	IRENA	But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
L151126	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
L151125	u4722	m313	IRENA	Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
L151124	u4719	m313	AMY	But she's dead!
L151123	u4722	m313	IRENA	You mustn't be afraid.
L151122	u4719	m313	AMY	She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
L151121	u4722	m313	IRENA	Don't cry, Amy.
L151120	u4719	m313	AMY	It's you...Irena...my friend!
L150984	u4719	m313	AMY	I want to touch it.
L150983	u4722	m313	IRENA	It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
L150982	u4719	m313	AMY	May I pet the deer?
L150981	u4722	m313	IRENA	It's a warm breath -- warm and strong ? warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
L150980	u4719	m313	AMY	I can sea its breath in the cold.
L150979	u4722	m313	IRENA	Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
L150978	u4719	m313	AMY	It stands so still.
L150977	u4722	m313	IRENA	You wanted to share this moment with me.
L150976	u4719	m313	AMY	So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
L150964	u4722	m313	IRENA	A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
L150963	u4719	m313	AMY	Merry Christmas.
L150959	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, please!
L150958	u4722	m313	IRENA	You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
L150957	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
L150956	u4722	m313	IRENA	I shall wear it in my hair!
L150955	u4719	m313	AMY	It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
L150954	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh, how beautiful!
L150953	u4719	m313	AMY	You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
L150952	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh, thank you, Amy.
L150951	u4719	m313	AMY	Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
L150908	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
L150907	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
L150906	u4722	m313	IRENA	All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
L150905	u4719	m313	AMY	My dolls. We can pretend.
L150904	u4722	m313	IRENA	Your children?
L150903	u4719	m313	AMY	No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
L150901	u4722	m313	IRENA	Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt

L150898	u4719	m313	AMY	That one's an elm.
L150897	u4722	m313	IRENA	There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
L150894	u4722	m313	IRENA	Of course,
L150893	u4719	m313	AMY	This is more fun than just pretend.
L150892	u4722	m313	IRENA	That's right!
L150891	u4719	m313	AMY	Yes, yes! I see Prince,
L150890	u4722	m313	IRENA	Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
L150889	u4719	m313	AMY	A princess?
L150888	u4722	m313	IRENA	Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
L150887	u4719	m313	AMY	The numbers simply don't mean anything
L150886	u4722	m313	IRENA	But you must!
L150885	u4719	m313	AMY	I'll just never learn arithmetic.
L150884	u4722	m313	IRENA	Can't you get it, darling?
L150883	u4722	m313	IRENA	Whenever you want.
L150882	u4719	m313	AMY	You'll always play with me?
L150881	u4719	m313	AMY	Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
L150880	u4722	m313	IRENA	No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
L150879	u4719	m313	AMY	Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
L150878	u4722	m313	IRENA	For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
L150877	u4719	m313	AMY	I shall want you for always.
L150876	u4722	m313	IRENA	For as long as you'll let me.
L150875	u4719	m313	AMY	Will you be friend for always?
L150874	u4722	m313	IRENA	I can not tell you.
L150873	u4719	m313	AMY	But where is that?
L150872	u4722	m313	IRENA	You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
L150871	u4719	m313	AMY	But where do you come from?
L150870	u4722	m313	IRENA	I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
L150869	u4719	m313	AMY	I've wanted a friend.
L150868	u4722	m313	IRENA	I'm your friend.
L150867	u4719	m313	AMY	Irena. But who are you?
L150866	u4722	m313	IRENA	You called me by my name.
L150865	u4719	m313	AMY	Who are you?
L151020	u4719	m313	AMY	But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
L151019	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It got hit.
L151018	u4719	m313	AMY	But it was alive ? it was fast and strong!
L151017	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Because it can't. It's dead.
L151016	u4719	m313	AMY	Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
L151015	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
L151014	u4719	m313	AMY	But what happened to the little deer?
L151013	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Bad luck to see death in the snow.
L151012	u4719	m313	AMY	But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
L151011	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
L150986	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
L150985	u4719	m313	AMY	There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
L150830	u4721	m313	EDWARD	But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
L150829	u4719	m313	AMY	But she's such a nice lady.
L150828	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
L150813	u4719	m313	AMY	But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
L150812	u4721	m313	EDWARD	About time for you to come home, Amy.
L150747	u4719	m313	AMY	That means I can go alone?
L150746	u4721	m313	EDWARD	I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
L150745	u4719	m313	AMY	You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
L150744	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Soon as I finish.
L150743	u4719	m313	AMY	Will you come soon?
L150742	u4721	m313	EDWARD	You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
L150741	u4719	m313	AMY	But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
L150740	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
L150708	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
L150707	u4719	m313	AMY	I wasn't singing to myself.
L150697	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Let me take another look at that ring.
L150696	u4719	m313	AMY	I'm trying to.
L150695	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
L150658	u4721	m313	EDWARD	That's the clever way to do it.
L150657	u4719	m313	AMY	Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
L150656	u4721	m313	EDWARD	They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
L150655	u4719	m313	AMY	the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
L150654	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
L150653	u4719	m313	AMY	A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
L150652	u4721	m313	EDWARD	I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
L150651	u4719	m313	AMY	It's a pretty ring.
L150650	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
L150649	u4719	m313	AMY	A lady threw it to me.
L150648	u4721	m313	EDWARD	That's a fine-looking ring.
L150647	u4719	m313	AMY	Look at my ring.
L150559	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
L150558	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
L151116	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	I can't do it! I can't do it!
L151115	u4719	m313	AMY	Hurry!
L151114	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Yes, yes -
L151113	u4719	m313	AMY	Hurry, hurry.
L151110	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
L151109	u4719	m313	AMY	Hide me? Why?
L151005	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
L151004	u4719	m313	AMY	And does he kill people?
L151002	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Don't you read Shakespeare?
L151001	u4719	m313	AMY	Who's Herne the Huntsman?
L150998	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Don't you hear it?
L150997	u4719	m313	AMY	What?
L150989	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
L150988	u4719	m313	AMY	I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
L150817	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Good.
L150816	u4719	m313	AMY	He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
L150809	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
L150808	u4719	m313	AMY	Why hasn't he got a head?
L150807	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	The Headless Horseman --
L150804	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	"Do you know the story of ""The Headless Horseman?"""
L150803	u4719	m313	AMY	Mommy read it to ne.
L150802	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Then I'll tell you a story ? a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
L150801	u4719	m313	AMY	I like stories.
L150799	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
L150798	u4719	m313	AMY	No, thank you.
L150797	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
L150796	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
L150795	u4719	m313	AMY	Who is she?
L150794	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me ? always!
L150792	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
L150791	u4719	m313	AMY	But I only came to give back the ring.
L150790	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days ? those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
L150789	u4719	m313	AMY	But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
L150788	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
L150787	u4719	m313	AMY	If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
L150786	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
L151106	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Good night...Barbara...
L151105	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Good night, mother, good night.
L151104	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
L151103	u4720	m313	BARBARA	If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
L151102	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
L151101	u4720	m313	BARBARA	There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
L151099	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
L151098	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
L151096	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
L151095	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Mother! You called me by name!
L151092	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	It was pale...a shadowed gold.
L151091	u4720	m313	BARBARA	And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
L151090	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Yes...yes, that's true.
L151089	u4720	m313	BARBARA	And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
L151088	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
L151087	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
L151086	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Anybody could know that song.
L151085	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
L151076	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
L151075	u4720	m313	BARBARA	But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
L151074	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
L151073	u4720	m313	BARBARA	I hate the storm. I hate it!
L151010	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	My daughter died long ago.
L151009	u4720	m313	BARBARA	You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
L150834	u4720	m313	BARBARA	Look at me.
L150833	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
L151007	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
L151006	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
L150999	u4721	m313	EDWARD	What is it, ma'am?
L150996	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Wait a minute. Listen.
L150995	u4721	m313	EDWARD	It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
L150991	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	That's from her -- that woman.
L150990	u4721	m313	EDWARD	There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
L150822	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Come away, Amy.
L150821	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
L150820	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
L150819	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	On the dark nights ? on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
L150815	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Now, I don't know Amy --
L150814	u4725	m313	MRS. FARREN	Let the child stay.
L150916	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
L150915	u4726	m313	OLIVER	"To Daddy from Amy. Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, ""To Edward from Amy.""."
L150706	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
L150705	u4726	m313	OLIVER	That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
L150704	u4721	m313	EDWARD	I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
L150702	u4721	m313	EDWARD	So do I, Mr. Reed.
L150701	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I like to see her happy.
L150700	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Amy looks happy ? seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
L150591	u4721	m313	EDWARD	She pleaded so to do it
L150590	u4726	m313	OLIVER	And Amy mailed them?
L150589	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
L150569	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Go on -- out with you.
L150568	u4721	m313	EDWARD	You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
L150565	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
L150564	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
L150563	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
L150562	u4721	m313	EDWARD	When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
L150561	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
L150560	u4721	m313	EDWARD	Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
L151066	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
L151065	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
L151060	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
L151059	u4726	m313	OLIVER	But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
L151058	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
L151057	u4726	m313	OLIVER	She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
L150554	u4726	m313	OLIVER	We'll see that she gets there in good time
L150553	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
L150529	u4726	m313	OLIVER	Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
L150528	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
L150527	u4726	m313	OLIVER	No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
L150526	u4724	m313	MISS CALLAHAN	Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
L150525	u4726	m313	OLIVER	I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
L164865	u4825	m322	BELLE	They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
L164864	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Who are these people?
L164825	u4825	m322	BELLE	They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
L164824	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What are those people doing there? What do they want?
L164752	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
L164751	u4825	m322	BELLE	Jabez! Careful --
L164750	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
L164746	u4828	m322	JABEZ	The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
L164745	u4825	m322	BELLE	The people, Jabez -- the people.
L164657	u4825	m322	BELLE	Of course I will.
L164656	u4828	m322	JABEZ	We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
L164643	u4825	m322	BELLE	We will --
L164642	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
L164631	u4825	m322	BELLE	No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
L164630	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Let's dance together -- Belle.
L164620	u4825	m322	BELLE	No -- that's for me to do.
L164619	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I'll take it.
L164617	u4828	m322	JABEZ	From over the mountain --
L164616	u4825	m322	BELLE	Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
L164845	u4831	m322	MARY	That's my problem, Belle.
L164844	u4825	m322	BELLE	You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
L164843	u4831	m322	MARY	I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
L164842	u4825	m322	BELLE	You know that you're in my house.
L164841	u4831	m322	MARY	Lying to you -- Why should I?
L164840	u4825	m322	BELLE	You're lying.
L164839	u4831	m322	MARY	I didn't.
L164838	u4825	m322	BELLE	I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
L164695	u4831	m322	MARY	He lied to me again.
L164694	u4825	m322	BELLE	That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
L164626	u4831	m322	MARY	Thank you, Belle --
L164625	u4825	m322	BELLE	Belle --
L164624	u4831	m322	MARY	No, thank you -- what's your name?
L164623	u4825	m322	BELLE	You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
L164622	u4825	m322	BELLE	I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
L164621	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- ?
L164803	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
L164802	u4826	m322	DANIEL	But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
L164801	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
L164800	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Anybody can see that.
L164799	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
L164798	u4826	m322	DANIEL	What's that, sir?
L164797	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
L164796	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
L164795	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
L164794	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
L164793	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
L164792	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Why? It don't hurt.
L164791	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
L164790	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	And serve him right!
L164789	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
L164788	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	And what about Daniel Webster?
L164787	u4826	m322	DANIEL	I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
L164786	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
L164785	u4826	m322	DANIEL	'N Daniel Webster will be there.
L164784	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Young man -- you got me there.
L164783	u4826	m322	DANIEL	And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
L164782	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Guess there will, if it says so.
L164781	u4826	m322	DANIEL	No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
L164780	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	It hasn't opened yet?
L164779	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Gee -- that Fair --
L164778	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	All right, Daniel. Jump in.
L164777	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
L164776	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
L164956	u4831	m322	MARY	All right, darling.
L164955	u4826	m322	DANIEL	I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
L164954	u4831	m322	MARY	Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
L164953	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Mama!
L164823	u4826	m322	DANIEL	No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
L164822	u4831	m322	MARY	Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
L164690	u4831	m322	MARY	Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
L164689	u4826	m322	DANIEL	No! No! I won't.
L164688	u4831	m322	MARY	Daniel give me that beanshooter!
L164687	u4826	m322	DANIEL	It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
L164686	u4831	m322	MARY	Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
L164710	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Not me! 
L164709	u4829	m322	MA STONE	I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
L164708	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Grandma, look at me!
L164685	u4826	m322	DANIEL	I did not, Grandma.
L164684	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
L164683	u4829	m322	MA STONE	That's just too bad --
L164682	u4826	m322	DANIEL	But I like the new one better.
L164681	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
L164680	u4826	m322	DANIEL	Granny, when do we move to the new house?
L164532	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
L164531	u4827	m322	HANK	Say ... about the interest ...
L164529	u4827	m322	HANK	Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
L164528	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
L164527	u4827	m322	HANK	Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
L164526	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
L164525	u4827	m322	HANK	Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
L164524	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
L164523	u4827	m322	HANK	Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
L164522	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
L164521	u4827	m322	HANK	Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
L164520	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Howdy, Hank.
L164519	u4827	m322	HANK	Howdy, Jabez.
L165032	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
L165031	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
L165030	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
L164291	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
L164290	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
L164287	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
L164286	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What Grange?
L164285	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
L164284	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What do you want?
L164204	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Black Dan'l?
L164203	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
L164202	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
L164201	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
L164200	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
L164194	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
L164193	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Sure am.
L164192	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
L164191	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
L164190	u4838	m322	TOM SHARP	Loan shark -- hey?
L164615	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Belle --
L164614	u4837	m322	THE WOMAN	Belle.
L164613	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Never mind. What's your name?
L164610	u4837	m322	THE WOMAN	But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
L164609	u4828	m322	JABEZ	She couldn't be gone!
L164608	u4837	m322	THE WOMAN	No. She's gone.
L164607	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You're not -- Dorothy.
L164863	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
L164862	u4836	m322	STEVENS	I do -- and I think you should too.
L164861	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
L164860	u4836	m322	STEVENS	What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
L164859	u4828	m322	JABEZ	All right -- so it's buried with you!
L164858	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Don't say that -- I know it is --
L164857	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
L164856	u4836	m322	STEVENS	But what becomes of our souls?
L164855	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
L164854	u4836	m322	STEVENS	-- of what happens after we die!
L164853	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Afraid ... of what?
L164852	u4836	m322	STEVENS	You are afraid!
L164851	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What's the matter with you?
L164849	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
L164848	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
L164847	u4836	m322	STEVENS	What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
L164846	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Now run along, Daniel.
L164832	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
L164831	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Where's everybody?
L164830	u4828	m322	JABEZ	No, you're not.
L164829	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
L164661	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Some other time, Stevens.
L164660	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
L164659	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
L164658	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Mornin', Jabez ...
L164339	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
L164338	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
L164337	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
L164336	u4836	m322	STEVENS	I'd like to know where you'd get it....
L164335	u4828	m322	JABEZ	-- in gold.
L164334	u4836	m322	STEVENS	No, Stone!
L164333	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
L164332	u4836	m322	STEVENS	Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
L164331	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Stevens!
L164997	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
L164996	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You know darn well it is.
L164995	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
L164994	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
L164991	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
L164990	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
L164989	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
L164952	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Never!
L164951	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
L164950	u4828	m322	JABEZ	About what?
L164949	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
L164909	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
L164908	u4828	m322	JABEZ	No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
L164907	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
L164906	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
L164905	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
L164904	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
L164903	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
L164902	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
L164901	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
L164900	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I'm through with you.
L164899	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
L164898	u4828	m322	JABEZ	My time isn't up yet.
L164897	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
L164896	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Are they all as -- small -- as that?
L164894	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	He was --
L164893	u4828	m322	JABEZ	He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
L164892	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
L164888	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
L164887	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
L164886	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
L164561	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
L164560	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Leave your tongue off of that!
L164559	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
L164558	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I don't care.
L164557	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
L164556	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Look here now--
L164555	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
L164307	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
L164306	u4828	m322	JABEZ	The seventh day of April --
L164305	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
L164304	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well, I'll be -- 
L164303	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
L164301	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
L164300	u4828	m322	JABEZ	No, no! Give it to me!
L164299	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
L164298	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What does it mean here -- about my soul?
L164297	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
L164296	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It's mine?
L164295	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
L164294	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes, why shouldn't it?
L164293	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
L164292	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Where did it come from?
L164279	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
L164278	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
L164277	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
L164276	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Opportunities?
L164275	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
L164274	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
L164273	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
L165029	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
L165028	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
L165022	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
L165021	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well, I --
L165020	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
L164937	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
L164936	u4828	m322	JABEZ	There's no joy in it for me.
L164935	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
L164933	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
L164932	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Not long -- now.
L164931	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
L164924	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- at midnight.
L164923	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
L164922	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
L164921	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
L164880	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
L164879	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
L164878	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
L164877	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
L164876	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
L164875	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
L164874	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
L164873	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What -- what's on your mind?
L164872	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
L164871	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
L164428	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
L164427	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
L164426	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
L164405	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
L164404	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
L164397	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
L164396	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
L164395	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
L164394	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Thank you, Mr. Webster.
L164393	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
L164392	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Ten throws it is.
L164391	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
L164775	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Shake!
L164774	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
L164773	u4828	m322	JABEZ	How much?
L164772	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Why not -- ?
L164771	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
L164770	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	You are not so sure that he'll come.
L164769	u4828	m322	JABEZ	That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
L164768	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Well -- yes --
L164767	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
L164766	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
L164765	u4828	m322	JABEZ	"Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: ""Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor."" Golly, I can see their eyes pop already."
L164764	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	You want me to go around --
L164763	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
L164762	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
L164761	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	The only one you missed -- is the President.
L164760	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
L164759	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Yes.
L164758	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
L164757	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Dan'l Webster?
L164756	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
L164755	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Why of course --
L164754	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
L164753	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
L164749	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You really think so?
L164748	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
L164747	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
L164488	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Well? Don't a politician have to be?
L164487	u4828	m322	JABEZ	But -- I was just lucky.
L164484	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
L164483	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
L164477	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Camomile tea!
L164476	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
L164475	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Headache -- Squire?
L164474	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Oh!
L164473	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
L164472	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
L164469	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
L164468	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
L164465	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Morning, Jabez.
L164464	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Why -- good morning, Squire.
L164434	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Shall we?
L164433	u4835	m322	SQUIRE	Coming along, Jabez?
L165019	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary!
L165018	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- Jabez!
L164930	u4831	m322	MARY	All right, Jabez ...
L164929	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You must go now, Mary -- you must!
L164919	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
L164918	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary! Come back ...
L164917	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez!
L164916	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
L164821	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
L164820	u4831	m322	MARY	It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
L164819	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
L164817	u4831	m322	MARY	I don't know, Jabez.
L164816	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Why don't they come --
L164705	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
L164704	u4831	m322	MARY	Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
L164703	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It shows on your face.
L164702	u4831	m322	MARY	But Jabez, I never said that!
L164701	u4828	m322	JABEZ	He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
L164700	u4831	m322	MARY	My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
L164699	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Isn't that your own fault?
L164698	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
L164693	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
L164692	u4831	m322	MARY	I am going to lock him up.
L164691	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What happened.... Where are you taking him?
L164637	u4831	m322	MARY	Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
L164636	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
L164635	u4831	m322	MARY	Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
L164602	u4831	m322	MARY	Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
L164601	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well -- I -- I-
L164596	u4831	m322	MARY	Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
L164595	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary --
L164571	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
L164570	u4831	m322	MARY	Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
L164518	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
L164517	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
L164514	u4828	m322	JABEZ	And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
L164513	u4831	m322	MARY	No, no. I don't want to be idle.
L164512	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
L164511	u4831	m322	MARY	But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
L164510	u4828	m322	JABEZ	But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
L164509	u4831	m322	MARY	It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
L164508	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I'm serious.
L164507	u4831	m322	MARY	Yes, Mr. Selectman!
L164506	u4828	m322	JABEZ	That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
L164505	u4831	m322	MARY	I'll never get my washing done.
L164504	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
L164494	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh -- Jabez.
L164493	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
L164480	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Thanks, Mary.
L164479	u4831	m322	MARY	I'll get it, Jabez.
L164478	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
L164462	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez --
L164461	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary --
L164460	u4831	m322	MARY	Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
L164459	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
L164458	u4831	m322	MARY	There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
L164454	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
L164453	u4831	m322	MARY	You'll never change -- will you?
L164452	u4828	m322	JABEZ	There is nothing to worry about now.
L164451	u4831	m322	MARY	Worried!
L164450	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Tired?
L164449	u4831	m322	MARY	But I'm glad to be home again --
L164448	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
L164447	u4828	m322	JABEZ	"Remember, Mary, how he said it: ""Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone,"" and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth."
L164436	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
L164435	u4831	m322	MARY	We must go on home, Jabez.
L164358	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Looks right elegant, Mary.
L164357	u4831	m322	MARY	What do you think of that, Jabez?
L164327	u4831	m322	MARY	I'd love to.
L164326	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
L164325	u4831	m322	MARY	It feels fine now, Jabez.
L164315	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
L164314	u4831	m322	MARY	Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
L164313	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary -- what would you do?
L164312	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez!
L164311	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
L164267	u4831	m322	MARY	No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
L164266	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I'll get the doctor.
L164263	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary -- how do you feel?
L164262	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez ...
L164261	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary--
L164250	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
L164249	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
L164248	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
L164247	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez!
L164237	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
L164236	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
L164235	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
L164234	u4831	m322	MARY	You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
L164233	u4828	m322	JABEZ	To save us work on the spring plowing?
L164232	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
L164231	u4828	m322	JABEZ	If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
L164230	u4831	m322	MARY	It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
L164229	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
L164228	u4831	m322	MARY	Not all of it?
L164227	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Mary -- it's gone.
L164226	u4831	m322	MARY	Do you think I'm grudging it?
L164225	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Your butter money?
L164224	u4831	m322	MARY	We can still use my butter money.
L164223	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well -- what are we going to do?
L164216	u4828	m322	JABEZ	If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
L164215	u4831	m322	MARY	That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
L164214	u4828	m322	JABEZ	" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
L164170	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
L164169	u4831	m322	MARY	Who is it?
L164168	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
L164158	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
L164157	u4831	m322	MARY	He's stubborn as a Stone.
L164152	u4828	m322	JABEZ	That's what we said.
L164151	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
L164150	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
L164149	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yep.
L164148	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh, Jabez.
L164147	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I think his leg is broken.
L164140	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You're right, Mary.
L164139	u4831	m322	MARY	Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
L164138	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
L164134	u4828	m322	JABEZ	All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
L164133	u4831	m322	MARY	He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
L164132	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Down, Shep! Down!
L164131	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Coming.
L164130	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- help!
L165025	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
L165024	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
L164915	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
L164914	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
L164913	u4829	m322	MA STONE	My son ... what's the matter?
L164654	u4829	m322	MA STONE	And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
L164653	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I want you to fix these fish!
L164604	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Sure, Ma.
L164603	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
L164594	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
L164593	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
L164592	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You'll be a father any minute now.
L164591	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma -- is she? --
L164569	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
L164568	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
L164567	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I say -- it don't matter.
L164566	u4829	m322	MA STONE	What's that you say, Son?
L164565	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It don't matter!
L164564	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
L164553	u4829	m322	MA STONE	A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
L164552	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
L164551	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
L164550	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Wouldn't profit him none.
L164549	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
L164548	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
L164547	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Do you really think that?
L164546	u4829	m322	MA STONE	I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
L164545	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
L164544	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Me -- a son.
L164543	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
L164542	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
L164541	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
L164540	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
L164538	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
L164537	u4828	m322	JABEZ	My son! Do you really think, Ma....
L164536	u4829	m322	MA STONE	It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
L164516	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
L164515	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
L164324	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
L164323	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
L164319	u4828	m322	JABEZ	But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
L164318	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
L164317	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
L164316	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You found it in the barn, hey?
L164260	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
L164259	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Hush up such talk, Jabez!
L164258	u4828	m322	JABEZ	And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
L164257	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well ... make him keep quiet.
L164256	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I dunno.
L164255	u4829	m322	MA STONE	What's ailing that dog?
L164246	u4829	m322	MA STONE	All right, son -- if it helps.
L164245	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Helps sometimes to say it.
L164244	u4829	m322	MA STONE	That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
L164243	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
L164242	u4829	m322	MA STONE	I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
L164241	u4828	m322	JABEZ	How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
L164164	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
L164163	u4828	m322	JABEZ	There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
L164162	u4828	m322	JABEZ	That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
L164161	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
L164160	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Hard luck -- like me.
L164159	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You know that, son.
L164156	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
L164155	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
L164154	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Consarn the consarn --
L164153	u4829	m322	MA STONE	There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."""
L164674	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
L164673	u4834	m322	SHERIFF	Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
L164672	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Come in, Sheriff.
L164490	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Very well, folks. I accept.
L164489	u4834	m322	SHERIFF	It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
L164330	u4828	m322	JABEZ	And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
L164329	u4834	m322	SHERIFF	Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
L164328	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Hello, Sheriff.
L164221	u4834	m322	SHERIFF	The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
L164220	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Let him try it.
L164219	u4834	m322	SHERIFF	Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
L164218	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It's all right, Sheriff.
L164217	u4834	m322	SHERIFF	Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
L164815	u4831	m322	MARY	I won't forget.
L164814	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
L164813	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
L164812	u4831	m322	MARY	You aren't angry with me?
L164811	u4829	m322	MA STONE	So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
L164716	u4831	m322	MARY	I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
L164715	u4829	m322	MA STONE	What's that?
L164714	u4831	m322	MARY	Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
L164713	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
L164712	u4831	m322	MARY	Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
L164711	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
L164652	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
L164651	u4829	m322	MA STONE	She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
L164649	u4831	m322	MARY	Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
L164648	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
L164629	u4831	m322	MARY	What mountain?
L164628	u4829	m322	MA STONE	The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
L164627	u4831	m322	MARY	What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
L164503	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
L164502	u4831	m322	MARY	You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
L164321	u4829	m322	MA STONE	H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
L164320	u4831	m322	MARY	I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
L164265	u4831	m322	MARY	Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
L164264	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
L164167	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
L164166	u4831	m322	MARY	That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
L164145	u4831	m322	MARY	I guess we won't.
L164144	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
L164137	u4831	m322	MARY	Coming, Ma.
L164136	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Mary -- Jabez --
L164135	u4831	m322	MARY	You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
L164411	u4830	m322	MARTIN	Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
L164410	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
L164409	u4830	m322	MARTIN	Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
L164408	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
L164407	u4830	m322	MARTIN	Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
L164406	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
L165034	u4831	m322	MARY	She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
L165033	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
L164928	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I'll do my best, Mary.
L164927	u4831	m322	MARY	Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
L164926	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
L164925	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez ...
L164870	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
L164869	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
L164741	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
L164740	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
L164739	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
L164738	u4831	m322	MARY	You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
L164737	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
L164736	u4831	m322	MARY	Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
L164735	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
L164734	u4831	m322	MARY	Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
L164733	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
L164732	u4831	m322	MARY	Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
L164731	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
L164730	u4831	m322	MARY	Of course not --
L164729	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
L164728	u4831	m322	MARY	No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
L164727	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
L164431	u4831	m322	MARY	-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
L164430	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
L164429	u4831	m322	MARY	It is.
L164726	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
L164725	u4832	m322	OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE	Just someone from New Hampshire!
L164724	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
L164723	u4832	m322	OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE	Someone to see you, Dan'l!
L164722	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Hullooo!
L164721	u4832	m322	OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE	Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
L165016	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
L165015	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
L164985	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I object.
L164984	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
L164973	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
L164972	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
L164971	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
L164970	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
L164969	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
L164968	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	You mean -- a jury trial?
L164967	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
L164966	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
L164965	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
L164964	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
L164963	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
L164962	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
L164961	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
L164960	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
L164948	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Cup for cup!
L164947	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
L164946	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
L164945	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
L164944	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Me?
L164943	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
L164942	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
L164941	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
L164940	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
L164939	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Mr. Webster, I presume?
L164390	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Pretty good -- that's perfect!
L164389	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Say, that's pretty good, young man.
L164388	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	I'll be there, too!
L164387	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
L164386	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
L164385	u4839	m322	WEBSTER	Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
L164384	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
L164353	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
L164352	u4836	m322	STEVENS	I can't be honest with them.
L164351	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	Why don't you?
L164350	u4836	m322	STEVENS	No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
L164349	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	You can talk to me ...
L164348	u4836	m322	STEVENS	I want someone to talk to ...
L164347	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
L164346	u4836	m322	STEVENS	That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
L164345	u4833	m322	SCRATCH	My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
L164344	u4836	m322	STEVENS	I wanted to give it all to the church.
L191966	u5104	m337	VADER	And code the signal to my private chamber.
L191965	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	Yes, My Lord.
L191964	u5104	m337	VADER	Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
L191963	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
L191962	u5104	m337	VADER	The Emperor?
L191961	u5090	m337	ADMIRAL	It was .... the Emperor ....
L192205	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
L192204	u5104	m337	VADER	Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
L192203	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
L191932	u5104	m337	VADER	Yes, Admiral .... soon.
L191931	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Soon, Lord Vader.
L191930	u5104	m337	VADER	Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
L191929	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
L191928	u5104	m337	VADER	Come in, Admiral.
L191927	u5091	m337	ADMIRAL PIETT	My lord.
L192357	u5105	m337	YODA	No ... there is another.
L192356	u5092	m337	BEN	The boy is our last hope.
L192355	u5105	m337	YODA	Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
L192353	u5105	m337	YODA	Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
L192352	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
L192345	u5092	m337	BEN	You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
L192344	u5105	m337	YODA	Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
L192086	u5092	m337	BEN	We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
L192085	u5105	m337	YODA	Will he finish what he begins?
L192083	u5105	m337	YODA	He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
L192082	u5092	m337	BEN	He'll learn.
L192079	u5105	m337	YODA	This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
L192078	u5092	m337	BEN	He can do it.
L192073	u5092	m337	BEN	We've discussed this before.
L192072	u5105	m337	YODA	Much anger in him, like in his father.
L192071	u5092	m337	BEN	He will learn patience.
L192343	u5092	m337	BEN	Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
L192342	u5100	m337	LUKE	You won't.
L192341	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
L192340	u5100	m337	LUKE	And that is why I must go.
L192339	u5092	m337	BEN	Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
L192336	u5092	m337	BEN	But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
L192335	u5100	m337	LUKE	I feel The Force.
L192334	u5092	m337	BEN	You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
L192333	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can help them!
L192332	u5092	m337	BEN	You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
L192331	u5100	m337	LUKE	But Han and Leia will surely die.
L192330	u5092	m337	BEN	... Luke, you must not go.
L191662	u5092	m337	BEN	Luke ... you are the only hope.
L191661	u5100	m337	LUKE	Ben ... Ben ...
L191660	u5092	m337	BEN	You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
L191659	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm cold ... so cold ...
L191658	u5092	m337	BEN	You must survive, Luke.
L191657	u5092	m337	BEN	You must.  Luke, look at me!
L191656	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can't ...
L192541	u5098	m337	LANDO	We're not out of this yet.
L192540	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
L192531	u5098	m337	LANDO	Okay, okay.
L192530	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
L192527	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
L192526	u5098	m337	LANDO	Three patrol ships are heading our way.
L192440	u5098	m337	LANDO	What's wrong with him?
L192439	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks a blue streak.
L192315	u5098	m337	LANDO	Everyone's invited, of course.
L192314	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
L192258	u5098	m337	LANDO	Right.
L192257	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Growls a reserved greeting.
L192256	u5098	m337	LANDO	How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
L192415	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
L192414	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks a doleful farewell.
L192376	u5097	m337	HAN	No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
L192375	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his concern.
L192324	u5097	m337	HAN	Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
L192323	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at Han.
L192306	u5097	m337	HAN	Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
L192305	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
L192243	u5097	m337	HAN	That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
L192242	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks and growls at his boss.
L192241	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, it's been awhile.
L192549	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
L192548	u5099	m337	LEIA	Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
L192525	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
L192524	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his consternation.
L192482	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Howls.
L192481	u5099	m337	LEIA	... the power?
L192476	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his ?right on!
L192475	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
L192472	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks his agreement.
L192471	u5099	m337	LEIA	We should have stayed and finished them off.
L192300	u5099	m337	LEIA	What happened?
L192299	u5093	m337	CHEWIE	Barks at his master.
L192068	u5100	m337	LUKE	How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
L192067	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
L192066	u5100	m337	LUKE	Because of my father, I guess.
L192065	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
L192064	u5100	m337	LUKE	Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
L192063	u5094	m337	CREATURE	It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
L192062	u5100	m337	LUKE	Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
L192061	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Patience.  It's time to eat.
L192060	u5100	m337	LUKE	... I told you, I'm not hungry.
L192019	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
L192018	u5100	m337	LUKE	You know the Jedi Master?
L192017	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
L192016	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
L192015	u5094	m337	CREATURE	No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
L192014	u5100	m337	LUKE	Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
L192013	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mine, mine.
L192010	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
L192009	u5100	m337	LUKE	I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
L192008	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
L192007	u5100	m337	LUKE	Give me that!
L192006	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
L192005	u5100	m337	LUKE	Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
L192001	u5094	m337	CREATURE	A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
L192000	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm looking for a great warrior.
L191999	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
L191998	u5100	m337	LUKE	Yeah ...
L191997	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
L191996	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm looking for someone.
L191995	u5094	m337	CREATURE	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
L191994	u5100	m337	LUKE	... Like we're being watched.
L191655	u5097	m337	HAN	Then I'll see you in Hell.
L191654	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
L191653	u5097	m337	HAN	You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
L191652	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	The temperature is dropping too fast.
L191651	u5097	m337	HAN	We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
L191650	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
L191649	u5097	m337	HAN	Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
L191648	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
L191642	u5097	m337	HAN	Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
L191641	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
L191640	u5097	m337	HAN	Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
L191639	u5095	m337	DECK SERGEANT	Yes sir!
L192100	u5104	m337	VADER	He will join us or die, My Master.
L192099	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
L192098	u5104	m337	VADER	But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
L192097	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
L192096	u5104	m337	VADER	He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
L192095	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
L192094	u5104	m337	VADER	Our destruction?  Who?
L192093	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
L192092	u5104	m337	VADER	I have felt it.
L192091	u5096	m337	EMPEROR	There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
L192090	u5104	m337	VADER	What is thy bidding, My Master?
L191711	u5097	m337	HAN	Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
L191710	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
L191709	u5097	m337	HAN	Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
L191603	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
L191602	u5097	m337	HAN	Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
L191601	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
L191600	u5097	m337	HAN	That's right.
L191598	u5097	m337	HAN	The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
L191597	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
L191596	u5097	m337	HAN	He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
L191595	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Good, and Commander Skywalker?
L191594	u5097	m337	HAN	There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
L191593	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
L192157	u5097	m337	HAN	Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
L192156	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
L192126	u5097	m337	HAN	Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
L192125	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
L192106	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm going to see what it is.
L192105	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	It sounds like it's trying to get in.
L191988	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
L191987	u5097	m337	HAN	You, too, golden rod.
L191969	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
L191968	u5097	m337	HAN	What are you so grouchy about?
L191907	u5097	m337	HAN	We're in trouble!
L191906	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
L191905	u5097	m337	HAN	I think we're in trouble.
L191897	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	It can wait.
L191896	u5097	m337	HAN	Sit down, and shut up!
L191895	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, I was wondering ...
L191857	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
L191856	u5097	m337	HAN	Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
L191686	u5097	m337	HAN	The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
L191685	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
L191684	u5097	m337	HAN	He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
L191644	u5097	m337	HAN	Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
L191643	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
L191636	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
L191635	u5097	m337	HAN	I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
L191634	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
L191633	u5097	m337	HAN	What is it?
L191632	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
L192417	u5097	m337	HAN	... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
L192416	u5099	m337	LEIA	... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
L192379	u5097	m337	HAN	Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
L192378	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
L192377	u5097	m337	HAN	I was worried about you.
L192308	u5097	m337	HAN	Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
L192307	u5099	m337	LEIA	No thanks.
L192304	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
L192303	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
L192302	u5099	m337	LEIA	Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
L192301	u5097	m337	HAN	He found him in a junk pile ...
L192298	u5097	m337	HAN	Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
L192297	u5099	m337	LEIA	I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
L192296	u5097	m337	HAN	Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
L192295	u5099	m337	LEIA	Has Threepio turned up yet?
L192294	u5097	m337	HAN	You look great.
L192293	u5099	m337	LEIA	You look silly.
L192292	u5097	m337	HAN	Who's staring?
L192291	u5099	m337	LEIA	What are you staring at?
L192250	u5097	m337	HAN	It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
L192249	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't like this.
L192228	u5097	m337	HAN	Let er go, Chewie.
L192227	u5099	m337	LEIA	You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
L192225	u5097	m337	HAN	No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
L192224	u5099	m337	LEIA	Can you trust him?
L192223	u5097	m337	HAN	A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
L192222	u5099	m337	LEIA	A mining colony.
L192221	u5097	m337	HAN	Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
L192220	u5099	m337	LEIA	Never heard of that system.
L192219	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
L192218	u5099	m337	LEIA	You keep logs?  My, how organized.
L192217	u5097	m337	HAN	Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
L192216	u5097	m337	HAN	Here ... near the Anoat system.
L192215	u5099	m337	LEIA	That depends.  Where are we?
L192214	u5097	m337	HAN	Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
L192213	u5099	m337	LEIA	Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
L192212	u5097	m337	HAN	The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
L192211	u5099	m337	LEIA	What'd you have in mind for your next move?
L192210	u5097	m337	HAN	Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
L192209	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
L192208	u5097	m337	HAN	Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
L192207	u5099	m337	LEIA	You could have warned him before you shut him off.
L192166	u5099	m337	LEIA	You're going to attack them?!!!
L192165	u5097	m337	HAN	Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
L192162	u5097	m337	HAN	It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
L192161	u5099	m337	LEIA	No lightspeed?
L192160	u5097	m337	HAN	Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
L192124	u5099	m337	LEIA	The entrance is collapsing!
L192123	u5097	m337	HAN	I see it Chewie, hang on.
L192122	u5099	m337	LEIA	But the tremors have stopped.
L192121	u5097	m337	HAN	Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
L192120	u5099	m337	LEIA	Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
L192112	u5097	m337	HAN	There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
L192111	u5099	m337	LEIA	Looks like some kind of Mynock.
L192108	u5097	m337	HAN	Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
L192107	u5099	m337	LEIA	Are you crazy!
L192104	u5099	m337	LEIA	Outside, in the cave.
L192103	u5097	m337	HAN	Where?
L192102	u5099	m337	LEIA	There's something out there!
L192057	u5097	m337	HAN	Try and control this ...
L192056	u5099	m337	LEIA	I do not!
L192055	u5097	m337	HAN	You mean a man you can control.
L192054	u5099	m337	LEIA	There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
L192053	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
L192052	u5099	m337	LEIA	Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
L192049	u5099	m337	LEIA	Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
L192048	u5097	m337	HAN	What are you afraid of?
L192046	u5097	m337	HAN	Why?
L192045	u5099	m337	LEIA	Stop that.
L192044	u5097	m337	HAN	That's quite a compliment.
L192043	u5099	m337	LEIA	Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
L192042	u5097	m337	HAN	You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
L192041	u5099	m337	LEIA	Yes, you do.
L192040	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
L192039	u5099	m337	LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that?
L192038	u5097	m337	HAN	Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
L192035	u5099	m337	LEIA	Where have I heard that before?
L192034	u5097	m337	HAN	They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
L192033	u5099	m337	LEIA	They're moving away.
L192031	u5099	m337	LEIA	Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
L192030	u5097	m337	HAN	That was no earthquake.
L191984	u5097	m337	HAN	Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
L191983	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
L191982	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, I hope you don't expect more.
L191981	u5099	m337	LEIA	Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
L191979	u5097	m337	HAN	Beautiful.
L191978	u5099	m337	LEIA	How do I look?
L191977	u5097	m337	HAN	You don't look angry.
L191976	u5099	m337	LEIA	Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
L191975	u5097	m337	HAN	Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
L191947	u5097	m337	HAN	That should do nicely.
L191946	u5099	m337	LEIA	What is it?
L191945	u5097	m337	HAN	There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
L191941	u5097	m337	HAN	Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
L191940	u5099	m337	LEIA	Now you're making sense.
L191939	u5097	m337	HAN	We've got to get out of this shower.
L191938	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm against that.
L191937	u5097	m337	HAN	But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
L191936	u5099	m337	LEIA	Good.
L191935	u5097	m337	HAN	That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
L191934	u5099	m337	LEIA	I take it back.
L191933	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
L191924	u5097	m337	HAN	Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
L191923	u5099	m337	LEIA	To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
L191922	u5097	m337	HAN	Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
L191921	u5099	m337	LEIA	Probably an asteroid field ....
L191920	u5097	m337	HAN	Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
L191919	u5099	m337	LEIA	Or you ran into something ....
L191918	u5097	m337	HAN	That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
L191894	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
L191893	u5097	m337	HAN	Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
L191892	u5097	m337	HAN	I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
L191874	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
L191873	u5097	m337	HAN	This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
L191872	u5099	m337	LEIA	This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
L191869	u5097	m337	HAN	Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
L191868	u5099	m337	LEIA	Would it help if I got out and pushed?
L191851	u5099	m337	LEIA	Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
L191850	u5097	m337	HAN	Hey!  Someone's still in here.
L191771	u5097	m337	HAN	Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
L191770	u5099	m337	LEIA	Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
L191769	u5097	m337	HAN	Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
L191768	u5099	m337	LEIA	You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
L191765	u5097	m337	HAN	Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
L191764	u5099	m337	LEIA	I don't know what he's talking about.
L191759	u5099	m337	LEIA	I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
L191758	u5097	m337	HAN	Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
L191716	u5097	m337	HAN	Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
L191715	u5099	m337	LEIA	An Imperial probe droid.
L191714	u5097	m337	HAN	Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
L191713	u5099	m337	LEIA	What was it?
L191712	u5097	m337	HAN	.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
L191691	u5097	m337	HAN	No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
L191690	u5099	m337	LEIA	Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
L191688	u5097	m337	HAN	Forget it.
L191687	u5099	m337	LEIA	Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
L191627	u5097	m337	HAN	Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
L191626	u5099	m337	LEIA	And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
L191625	u5097	m337	HAN	Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
L191624	u5099	m337	LEIA	We are fighting for a cause much ...
L191623	u5097	m337	HAN	There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
L191622	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
L191621	u5097	m337	HAN	Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
L191619	u5099	m337	LEIA	I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
L191618	u5097	m337	HAN	You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
L191617	u5099	m337	LEIA	And what are they, pray tell?
L191616	u5097	m337	HAN	You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
L191615	u5099	m337	LEIA	Me?  I don't know what you mean.
L191614	u5097	m337	HAN	Not you?
L191613	u5099	m337	LEIA	Yes.
L191612	u5097	m337	HAN	We?
L191611	u5099	m337	LEIA	Han, we need you here.
L191610	u5097	m337	HAN	He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
L191609	u5099	m337	LEIA	Does Luke know?
L191608	u5097	m337	HAN	That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
L191607	u5099	m337	LEIA	You said you were going to stay. What happened?
L191606	u5097	m337	HAN	Yes, Your Highness?
L191798	u5097	m337	HAN	Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
L191797	u5100	m337	LUKE	I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
L191767	u5097	m337	HAN	Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
L191766	u5100	m337	LUKE	About what?
L191761	u5097	m337	HAN	That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
L191760	u5100	m337	LUKE	Probe?  What probe?
L191757	u5097	m337	HAN	That's two you owe me, junior.
L191756	u5100	m337	LUKE	Thanks to you.
L191755	u5097	m337	HAN	Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
L191588	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
L191587	u5097	m337	HAN	There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
L191586	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
L191585	u5097	m337	HAN	Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
L192396	u5097	m337	HAN	Yeah, you're a real hero.
L192395	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
L192392	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
L192391	u5097	m337	HAN	All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
L192388	u5097	m337	HAN	Luke?  I don't get it.
L192387	u5098	m337	LANDO	He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
L192386	u5097	m337	HAN	You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
L192383	u5098	m337	LANDO	Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
L192382	u5097	m337	HAN	This ought to be good.
L192381	u5098	m337	LANDO	Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
L192380	u5097	m337	HAN	Get out of here, Lando!
L192327	u5097	m337	HAN	I'm sorry too.
L192326	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
L192272	u5097	m337	HAN	Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
L192271	u5098	m337	LANDO	Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
L192270	u5097	m337	HAN	How's your mining operation going?
L192269	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
L192268	u5097	m337	HAN	Hyperdrive.
L192267	u5098	m337	LANDO	That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
L192265	u5098	m337	LANDO	What have you done to my ship?
L192264	u5097	m337	HAN	Repairs ...
L192263	u5098	m337	LANDO	That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
L192255	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll bet.
L192254	u5097	m337	HAN	I always said you were a gentleman.
L192253	u5098	m337	LANDO	Are you kidding?
L192252	u5097	m337	HAN	No hard feelings?
L192251	u5098	m337	LANDO	Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
L192426	u5104	m337	VADER	I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
L192425	u5098	m337	LANDO	That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
L192424	u5104	m337	VADER	Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
L192423	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'll take what's mine now.
L192403	u5104	m337	VADER	I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
L192402	u5098	m337	LANDO	We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
L192370	u5104	m337	VADER	Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
L192369	u5098	m337	LANDO	No.
L192368	u5104	m337	VADER	I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
L192367	u5098	m337	LANDO	That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
L192366	u5104	m337	VADER	You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
L192365	u5098	m337	LANDO	What about Leia and the Wookiee?
L192547	u5099	m337	LEIA	That sounds familiar.
L192546	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
L192543	u5099	m337	LEIA	Are the coordinates set?
L192542	u5098	m337	LANDO	The deflector shields are gone.
L192535	u5099	m337	LEIA	It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
L192534	u5098	m337	LANDO	Someone's falling.
L192529	u5098	m337	LANDO	Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
L192528	u5099	m337	LEIA	No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
L192523	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke needs help.  We must go back.
L192522	u5098	m337	LANDO	What?
L192521	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke!
L192520	u5098	m337	LANDO	I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
L192517	u5098	m337	LANDO	I didn't say anything?
L192516	u5099	m337	LEIA	What'd you say?
L192499	u5098	m337	LANDO	His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
L192498	u5099	m337	LEIA	We've got to find Luke.
L192489	u5098	m337	LANDO	Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
L192488	u5099	m337	LEIA	You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
L192480	u5099	m337	LEIA	What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
L192479	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
L192478	u5099	m337	LEIA	You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
L192477	u5098	m337	LANDO	Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
L192446	u5098	m337	LANDO	There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
L192445	u5099	m337	LEIA	Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
L192438	u5098	m337	LANDO	This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
L192437	u5099	m337	LEIA	We have no use for your kind.
L192436	u5098	m337	LANDO	Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
L192435	u5099	m337	LEIA	And when do you betray us again?
L192434	u5098	m337	LANDO	I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
L192433	u5099	m337	LEIA	What's going on?
L192390	u5099	m337	LEIA	... we're the bait.
L192389	u5098	m337	LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
L192385	u5098	m337	LANDO	I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
L192384	u5099	m337	LEIA	What about Han?
L192322	u5098	m337	LANDO	Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
L192321	u5099	m337	LEIA	It's a lovely outpost.
L192320	u5098	m337	LANDO	Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
L192319	u5099	m337	LEIA	You're part of the mining guild then?
L192318	u5098	m337	LANDO	.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
L192313	u5098	m337	LANDO	Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
L192312	u5099	m337	LEIA	Thanks.
L192311	u5098	m337	LANDO	I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
L192310	u5099	m337	LEIA	Not really.
L192309	u5098	m337	LANDO	Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
L192260	u5099	m337	LEIA	You may call me Leia.
L192259	u5098	m337	LANDO	Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
L191823	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
L191822	u5099	m337	LEIA	Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
L191702	u5099	m337	LEIA	What is it?
L191701	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
L191695	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Not yet.  They're working on it now.
L191694	u5099	m337	LEIA	Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
L191677	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
L191676	u5099	m337	LEIA	Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
L191675	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
L191674	u5099	m337	LEIA	I understand.
L191673	u5102	m337	RIEEKAN	Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
L192514	u5099	m337	LEIA	Let's go.
L192513	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
L192240	u5099	m337	LEIA	I thought you knew this person.
L192239	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Rather touchy, aren't they.
L192164	u5099	m337	LEIA	Well, what now?
L192163	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
L192128	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Oh my, no!
L192127	u5099	m337	LEIA	What??
L191972	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
L191971	u5099	m337	LEIA	A tremor!
L191943	u5099	m337	LEIA	Closer?!
L191942	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	Closer?!
L191926	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
L191925	u5099	m337	LEIA	You don't have to do this to impress me.
L191739	u5099	m337	LEIA	I'll be back later.
L191738	u5103	m337	THREEPIO	So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
L191737	u5099	m337	LEIA	You rest now.
L192545	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've never seen it fail.
L192544	u5099	m337	LEIA	This hyperdrive had better work.
L192539	u5100	m337	LUKE	He'll survive.
L192538	u5099	m337	LEIA	Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
L192428	u5099	m337	LEIA	Luke, no!  It's a trap.
L192427	u5100	m337	LUKE	Leia!
L191752	u5100	m337	LUKE	Snow creatures ... they're here?!
L191751	u5099	m337	LEIA	I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
L191750	u5100	m337	LUKE	Jabba the Hutt?
L191749	u5099	m337	LEIA	He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
L191748	u5100	m337	LUKE	Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
L191747	u5100	m337	LUKE	Han's leaving?
L191746	u5099	m337	LEIA	First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
L191745	u5100	m337	LUKE	What are you talking about?
L191744	u5099	m337	LEIA	That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
L191743	u5100	m337	LUKE	I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
L191742	u5099	m337	LEIA	Where are you going?
L191741	u5099	m337	LEIA	What did you say?!
L191740	u5100	m337	LUKE	Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
L191731	u5099	m337	LEIA	Me too.  I was afraid.
L191730	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
L191729	u5099	m337	LEIA	The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
L192347	u5105	m337	YODA	If it must be.  Yes.
L192346	u5100	m337	LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia?
L192338	u5100	m337	LUKE	I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
L192337	u5105	m337	YODA	Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
L192290	u5105	m337	YODA	Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
L192289	u5100	m337	LUKE	They're my friends.
L192288	u5105	m337	YODA	Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
L192287	u5100	m337	LUKE	Will they die?
L192286	u5105	m337	YODA	It is the future you see.
L192285	u5100	m337	LUKE	I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
L192284	u5105	m337	YODA	Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
L192283	u5100	m337	LUKE	I see a city in the clouds.
L192282	u5105	m337	YODA	Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
L192281	u5100	m337	LUKE	My mind fills with so many images.
L192280	u5105	m337	YODA	Free your mind and return he will.
L192279	u5100	m337	LUKE	Ben?  Ben?
L192235	u5105	m337	YODA	Only what you take with you.
L192234	u5100	m337	LUKE	What's in there?
L192233	u5105	m337	YODA	This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
L192232	u5100	m337	LUKE	I feel cold.
L192230	u5100	m337	LUKE	Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
L192229	u5105	m337	YODA	Four this time!  The Force you feel.
L192199	u5105	m337	YODA	No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
L192198	u5100	m337	LUKE	But tell me why ...
L192197	u5105	m337	YODA	You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
L192196	u5100	m337	LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
L192195	u5105	m337	YODA	No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
L192194	u5100	m337	LUKE	Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
L192193	u5105	m337	YODA	The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
L192192	u5100	m337	LUKE	Price?  What do you mean?
L192191	u5105	m337	YODA	Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
L192190	u5100	m337	LUKE	But I feel The Force flowing!
L192189	u5105	m337	YODA	No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
L192187	u5105	m337	YODA	That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
L192186	u5100	m337	LUKE	They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
L192185	u5105	m337	YODA	That they are.
L192184	u5100	m337	LUKE	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
L192183	u5105	m337	YODA	Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
L192151	u5105	m337	YODA	That is why you fail.
L192150	u5100	m337	LUKE	I don't believe it.
L192147	u5105	m337	YODA	Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
L192146	u5100	m337	LUKE	I can't. It's too big.
L192145	u5105	m337	YODA	No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
L192144	u5100	m337	LUKE	Okay.  I'll give it a try.
L192143	u5105	m337	YODA	No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
L192142	u5100	m337	LUKE	Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
L192134	u5105	m337	YODA	Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
L192133	u5100	m337	LUKE	I thought I was in good shape.
L192132	u5105	m337	YODA	It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
L192088	u5105	m337	YODA	You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
L192087	u5100	m337	LUKE	I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
L192081	u5105	m337	YODA	You are reckless!
L192080	u5100	m337	LUKE	I have followed my feelings.
L192077	u5105	m337	YODA	To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
L192076	u5100	m337	LUKE	Why not me?
L192075	u5105	m337	YODA	Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
L192508	u5100	m337	LUKE	Never.
L192507	u5104	m337	VADER	There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
L192506	u5100	m337	LUKE	No! .... Never ....
L192505	u5104	m337	VADER	The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
L192458	u5100	m337	LUKE	Time will tell.
L192457	u5104	m337	VADER	All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
L192456	u5104	m337	VADER	That won't be necessary.
L192455	u5100	m337	LUKE	I'll die first.
L192454	u5104	m337	VADER	There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
L192453	u5100	m337	LUKE	No!
L192452	u5104	m337	VADER	Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
L192451	u5104	m337	VADER	And I too.
L192450	u5100	m337	LUKE	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
L192449	u5104	m337	VADER	The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
L191889	u5104	m337	VADER	I want that ship.
L191888	u5101	m337	PIETT	It won't get through the blockade.
L191887	u5104	m337	VADER	Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
L191886	u5101	m337	PIETT	Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
L191782	u5104	m337	VADER	Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
L191781	u5101	m337	PIETT	Yes, My Lord.
L191723	u5101	m337	PIETT	Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
L191722	u5104	m337	VADER	The Hoth System?
L197359	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
L197358	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
L197357	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	...I saw nothing.
L197356	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	When you threw it in, what did you see?
L197353	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
L197352	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	I cannot--
L197351	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
L197150	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	...Perceval!
L197149	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
L197143	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
L197142	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Is he coming?
L197342	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
L197341	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
L197340	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
L197339	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
L197338	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Arthur.
L197170	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	It is deep...
L197169	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
L197162	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
L197161	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
L197035	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
L197034	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
L197032	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
L197031	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
L197011	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
L197010	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
L197007	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
L197006	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
L197005	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I gave up my castles and my lands!
L197004	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	But your life and lands are far from here.
L197003	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
L197002	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
L197001	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
L197000	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Thanks to God, you are alive.
L196991	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
L196990	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	So be it, to the death.
L196989	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
L196988	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I sought only not to harm you, sir.
L196987	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
L196986	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I will not.
L196985	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Yield. I have the advantage.
L196981	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
L196980	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Move aside!
L196979	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
L196978	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
L196977	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
L196976	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
L196975	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
L196974	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
L196973	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Good day to you, sir.
L197332	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
L197331	u5128	m340	KAY	He can be no other.
L197309	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
L197308	u5128	m340	KAY	Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
L197307	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Of Merlin?
L197306	u5128	m340	KAY	Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
L197280	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
L197279	u5128	m340	KAY	Perceval, you have returned!
L197252	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
L197251	u5128	m340	KAY	Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
L197250	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	At last...
L197304	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
L197303	u5130	m340	MERLIN	--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
L197302	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
L197301	u5130	m340	MERLIN	But, I'm here.
L197300	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
L197299	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	What is this place, Merlin?
L197298	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
L197297	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
L197186	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
L197185	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
L197184	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
L197183	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
L197182	u5130	m340	MERLIN	My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
L197181	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
L197180	u5130	m340	MERLIN	That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
L197179	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
L197166	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
L197165	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
L197159	u5130	m340	MERLIN	A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
L197158	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
L197157	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Yes.
L197155	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What is it my child?
L197154	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
L197111	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
L197110	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
L197109	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
L197108	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
L197107	u5130	m340	MERLIN	At your service, sir.
L197040	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	...to ride out and meet them.
L197039	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
L196998	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
L196997	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Excalibur! Is it true?
L196972	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
L196971	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
L196970	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
L196969	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
L196968	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I should have left you to fend for yourself.
L196958	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
L196957	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Guenevere...
L196956	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
L196955	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
L196954	u5130	m340	MERLIN	There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
L196953	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
L196952	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	...of course...
L196951	u5130	m340	MERLIN	A king must marry, after all.
L196931	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What's this, what's this?!
L196930	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
L196912	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The dragon! There...
L196911	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	What?!
L196910	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
L196909	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	What book is that?
L196908	u5130	m340	MERLIN	In the great book.
L196907	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	How? Where?
L196904	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
L196903	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
L196902	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Thank you.
L196901	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
L196900	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
L196899	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
L196898	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
L196896	u5130	m340	MERLIN	'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
L196895	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
L196894	u5130	m340	MERLIN	That's not why you came.
L196893	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I want to thank you.
L196892	u5130	m340	MERLIN	But not from your destiny.
L196891	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	You saved me from the arrow...
L196883	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
L196882	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Whose son am I?
L196880	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Speak of the devil!...
L196879	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Who is Merlin?
L197264	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	So be it.
L197263	u5131	m340	MORDRED	I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
L197261	u5131	m340	MORDRED	And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
L197260	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
L197259	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Your mother told you that?
L197258	u5131	m340	MORDRED	The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
L197257	u5131	m340	MORDRED	And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
L197256	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I recognize you only as my son, no more.
L197255	u5131	m340	MORDRED	I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
L197254	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Rise, Mordred.
L197253	u5131	m340	MORDRED	Father...
L196965	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
L196964	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
L196878	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
L196877	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Who is, then?
L196867	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
L196866	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	You freed it, son?
L196865	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
L196853	u5134	m340	SIR ECTOR	Well hurry then, and get it.
L196852	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I left it in the tent, sir.
L197286	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	I have kept it.
L197285	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
L197284	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
L197140	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
L197139	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
L197138	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	And you cannot love me...
L197137	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
L197136	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Why can't you be my champion?
L197125	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Not you, my husband?
L197124	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
L197118	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
L197117	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
L197043	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Without Lancelot?!
L197042	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Don't start a war on my wedding day!
L197041	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
L197037	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
L197036	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
L196947	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
L196946	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I'm going.
L196945	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
L196944	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
L196943	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
L196942	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
L196941	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
L196939	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
L196938	u5125	m340	ARTHUR	Ye...
L196937	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	It didn't hurt too much, did it?
L197275	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
L197274	u5126	m340	FIGURE	I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
L197273	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	Because you and the land are one.
L197272	u5126	m340	FIGURE	I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
L197271	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	You, my lord.
L197270	u5126	m340	FIGURE	Who does it serve?
L197195	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	We are to blame.
L197194	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	The King without his sword, the land without a king...
L197193	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	He has given up.
L197192	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Why didn't he kill us?
L197176	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	--Nothing!
L197175	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	There are things about love--
L197174	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Love demands it.
L197173	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	The law forbids it.
L197057	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
L197056	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	To me? But why?
L197055	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Yes. I would swear my love to you.
L197054	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Me?
L197053	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	You.
L197052	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Who?!
L197051	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	There is one.
L197050	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
L197049	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
L197048	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	Why?
L197047	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	No.
L197046	u5127	m340	GUENEVERE	The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
L197135	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
L197134	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
L197084	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	Twenty days!? The world is that big?
L197083	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
L197082	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	I will run.
L197081	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Very well. Climb up.
L197077	u5133	m340	PERCEVAL	You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
L197076	u5129	m340	LANCELOT	Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
L197319	u5132	m340	MORGANA	--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
L197318	u5130	m340	MERLIN	--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
L197317	u5132	m340	MORGANA	I am the desert, where water disappears--
L197316	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
L197312	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
L197311	u5132	m340	MORGANA	You provoke me, Merlin.
L197209	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
L197208	u5130	m340	MERLIN	What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
L197206	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
L197205	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
L197204	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
L197203	u5132	m340	MORGANA	You are truly magnificent!
L197199	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Why?
L197198	u5130	m340	MERLIN	They do.
L197197	u5132	m340	MORGANA	People make you laugh?
L197196	u5130	m340	MERLIN	When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
L197190	u5130	m340	MERLIN	That I cannot.
L197189	u5132	m340	MORGANA	You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
L197105	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Maybe... maybe...
L197104	u5132	m340	MORGANA	The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
L197103	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
L197101	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
L197100	u5132	m340	MORGANA	A lovestruck page!
L197099	u5130	m340	MERLIN	No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
L197098	u5132	m340	MORGANA	It's clear you are, and it irks me.
L197097	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I'm not jealous!
L197096	u5130	m340	MERLIN	No, no, of course not. You are young...
L197067	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Can it truly be used for magic?
L197066	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It is.
L197065	u5132	m340	MORGANA	Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
L197064	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
L196838	u5130	m340	MERLIN	They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
L196837	u5135	m340	UTHER	You strike me with words as hard as steel.
L196836	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
L196835	u5135	m340	UTHER	To kill and be king, is that all?
L196834	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
L196830	u5130	m340	MERLIN	You didn't ask!
L196829	u5135	m340	UTHER	The oath. You didn't say--
L196828	u5130	m340	MERLIN	The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
L196827	u5135	m340	UTHER	I?
L196826	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Now you must pay me.
L196825	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
L196824	u5135	m340	UTHER	Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
L196788	u5135	m340	UTHER	I swear it.
L196787	u5130	m340	MERLIN	--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
L196786	u5135	m340	UTHER	I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
L196782	u5135	m340	UTHER	Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
L196781	u5130	m340	MERLIN	I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
L196761	u5135	m340	UTHER	One land, one king! That is my peace!
L196760	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
L196759	u5130	m340	MERLIN	Just show the sword.
L196758	u5135	m340	UTHER	I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
L196756	u5135	m340	UTHER	Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
L196755	u5130	m340	MERLIN	It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
L202936	u5192	m344	ADELLE	You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They?re all panicked here...
L202935	u5200	m344	JACK	Adelle?
L202934	u5192	m344	ADELLE	Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody?s here.
L202933	u5200	m344	JACK	Hello?
L202081	u5192	m344	ADELLE	That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
L202080	u5200	m344	JACK	I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
L202061	u5200	m344	JACK	She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
L202060	u5192	m344	ADELLE	No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
L202059	u5200	m344	JACK	No...
L202058	u5192	m344	ADELLE	And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
L202057	u5200	m344	JACK	I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
L202056	u5192	m344	ADELLE	Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
L202055	u5200	m344	JACK	God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
L202054	u5192	m344	ADELLE	So you left her?  Just like that?
L202053	u5200	m344	JACK	She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
L202052	u5192	m344	ADELLE	Excuse me?
L202051	u5200	m344	JACK	Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
L202050	u5192	m344	ADELLE	You?  Married?
L202049	u5200	m344	JACK	Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
L202048	u5192	m344	ADELLE	Yeah Jack, her assistant...
L202047	u5200	m344	JACK	Her assistant?
L202046	u5192	m344	ADELLE	Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
L202045	u5200	m344	JACK	Kate Reynolds...
L202044	u5200	m344	JACK	Ooh, my suits are ready...
L202043	u5192	m344	ADELLE	Oh, and Oxxford called...
L202042	u5192	m344	ADELLE	You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
L202041	u5200	m344	JACK	You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
L202948	u5193	m344	ALAN	So what are we gonna do, Jack?
L202947	u5200	m344	JACK	No.
L202946	u5193	m344	ALAN	Is this another one of those Sun Tzu ?Art of War? tricks?
L202945	u5200	m344	JACK	But I think I like you better this way...
L202944	u5193	m344	ALAN	Excuse me?
L202942	u5193	m344	ALAN	It?s not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We?re not sure which one, Julia?s on it right now. Word is they?re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we should?ve been prepared for this.  We?re in trouble here, Jack...
L202941	u5200	m344	JACK	What?s going on here?
L202940	u5193	m344	ALAN	Jack, are you okay?
L202820	u5200	m344	JACK	Oh, I?m hearing you, Alan. That?s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I don?t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and don?t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
L202819	u5193	m344	ALAN	I don?t think you?re hearing me.
L202818	u5200	m344	JACK	Good for you. Why shouldn?t you protect what?s yours.
L202813	u5200	m344	JACK	Seven.  Really.
L202812	u5193	m344	ALAN	...that?s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
L202799	u5200	m344	JACK	You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You?re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
L202798	u5193	m344	ALAN	What about me?
L202797	u5200	m344	JACK	Take you, for instance...
L202795	u5193	m344	ALAN	I?m sure you do...
L202794	u5200	m344	JACK	And I know people.
L202793	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s okay, Alan. I get it. I?m in your shoes, I?m thinking exactly the same thing...but here?s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it?s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they?re gonna send their kids to college.  It?s just people...
L202792	u5193	m344	ALAN	I?m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
L202791	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
L202789	u5193	m344	ALAN	Really. So you?re projecting what, a tad over two million?
L202788	u5200	m344	JACK	Well, Alan, I think we?re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
L202785	u5193	m344	ALAN	Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
L202784	u5200	m344	JACK	We did one point seven million in total revenue...
L202783	u5193	m344	ALAN	Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
L202782	u5200	m344	JACK	Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
L202781	u5193	m344	ALAN	Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
L202780	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s right. And auto supply...
L202779	u5193	m344	ALAN	A broker? Really. And now you?re in the tire business?
L202778	u5200	m344	JACK	I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
L202775	u5200	m344	JACK	Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
L202774	u5193	m344	ALAN	You have kids, Jack?
L202773	u5200	m344	JACK	I can see that, Alan.
L202772	u5193	m344	ALAN	Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
L202771	u5200	m344	JACK	Mr. Mintz.
L202038	u5200	m344	JACK	Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
L202037	u5193	m344	ALAN	Why Jack?
L202036	u5200	m344	JACK	I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
L202035	u5193	m344	ALAN	You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
L202032	u5193	m344	ALAN	I don't know.  Maybe...
L202031	u5200	m344	JACK	You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
L202030	u5200	m344	JACK	Is that tonight?
L202029	u5193	m344	ALAN	Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
L202661	u5194	m344	ANNIE	I?m not worried, Mom. He?s still learning our ways...
L202660	u5201	m344	KATE	Fighting?s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
L202486	u5201	m344	KATE	That?s right.  Okay, let?s make a quick stop at the kids? shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I?ll run into the linen store...
L202485	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
L202484	u5201	m344	KATE	We?re almost done here...
L202149	u5201	m344	KATE	Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
L202148	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Mom, don?t you think we need to open the presents?
L202147	u5201	m344	KATE	You?re jumping, sweetheart...
L202146	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Rise...and...shine...!
L202888	u5200	m344	JACK	No, honey. Go back to sleep.
L202887	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Is it morning yet?
L202867	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Ringing my bell...
L202866	u5200	m344	JACK	What are you doing?
L202855	u5200	m344	JACK	Ah. A classic...
L202854	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Mary Had A Little Lamb.
L202853	u5200	m344	JACK	Very nice. What is it?
L202655	u5200	m344	JACK	Right.  That?s a major oversight...  So if I?m Kate...I can?t really afford the finer things, my husband?s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I?m trapped in suburbia...
L202654	u5194	m344	ANNIE	That?s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
L202653	u5200	m344	JACK	Maybe there?s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
L202652	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Mom liked it.
L202651	u5200	m344	JACK	Don?t you think that?s a little gimmicky?
L202650	u5194	m344	ANNIE	One year he had a solar system named after her...
L202649	u5200	m344	JACK	Like what?
L202648	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
L202394	u5194	m344	ANNIE	That?s where you work.
L202393	u5200	m344	JACK	Big Ed?s?  Big Ed?s Tires?  Why...?
L202392	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Big Ed?s.
L202391	u5200	m344	JACK	Where do I go now?
L202389	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Bye...
L202388	u5200	m344	JACK	Got it.  Good tip.
L202387	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Try not to be late because kids don?t like to be the last one picked up.
L202386	u5200	m344	JACK	Five thirty.  Okay.
L202385	u5194	m344	ANNIE	I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
L202383	u5200	m344	JACK	Check...
L202382	u5194	m344	ANNIE	This is day care.  It?s where babies go when their parents are at work.
L202379	u5200	m344	JACK	Sure.
L202378	u5194	m344	ANNIE	You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
L202377	u5200	m344	JACK	I think I could figure it out.
L202376	u5194	m344	ANNIE	You know how to make chocolate milk?
L202375	u5200	m344	JACK	On a case by case basis...
L202374	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Do you like kids?
L202372	u5200	m344	JACK	Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
L202371	u5194	m344	ANNIE	The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
L202370	u5200	m344	JACK	Who did?
L202369	u5194	m344	ANNIE	They did a pretty good job.
L202367	u5200	m344	JACK	I don?t know...
L202366	u5194	m344	ANNIE	Where?s my real dad?
L202365	u5200	m344	JACK	This isn?t my real life. It?s just a glimpse...
L202932	u5200	m344	JACK	Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could?ve been really good friends...
L202931	u5195	m344	ARNIE	You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
L202930	u5200	m344	JACK	Yes, that?s it...yes, we went to high school together.
L202929	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You?re doing well...
L202928	u5200	m344	JACK	Yes...Jack Campbell...
L202927	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
L202926	u5195	m344	ARNIE	I never won anything in bowling.
L202925	u5200	m344	JACK	We bowl together. We?re bowlers ...we won a championship...we?re winners.
L202924	u5195	m344	ARNIE	How?d you know my name?
L202923	u5200	m344	JACK	Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
L202922	u5195	m344	ARNIE	I don?t care if you?re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can?t park here.
L202921	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s me, Jack...
L202920	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Hey, you can?t park that thing here.
L202611	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s your birthday? Today?  What?s your name?  Where were you born?
L202610	u5195	m344	ARNIE	So Jack, it?s your wife?s birthday, got anything to say to her?
L202578	u5195	m344	ARNIE	All I?m saying it there isn?t a guy in Union County who wouldn?t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
L202577	u5200	m344	JACK	Hey, is that really necessary?
L202576	u5195	m344	ARNIE	C?mon, Evelyn Thompson?s got no class.  She doesn?t marry Dr. Steve, the woman?s living in a trailer.
L202575	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Screw the rules.  I?m talking about the choice.
L202574	u5200	m344	JACK	I?m telling you, those rules don?t apply to me, Arn.
L202573	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Look, maybe I?m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation?s harmless but you?re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
L202572	u5200	m344	JACK	It wouldn?t really be cheating...  It?s complicated.
L202571	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You?re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
L202570	u5200	m344	JACK	So could you write down her exact address?
L202569	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
L202568	u5200	m344	JACK	Pretty much.
L202567	u5195	m344	ARNIE	She said that?
L202566	u5200	m344	JACK	She wants to have an affair with me.
L202565	u5195	m344	ARNIE	She is relentless.
L202564	u5200	m344	JACK	I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
L202563	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Hey Jack, you?re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
L202539	u5195	m344	ARNIE	You?re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
L202538	u5200	m344	JACK	Hey, I?m doing the best I can...  I?d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
L202537	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Where?s your follow through?  Where?s your stance?
L202536	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god?s sake!
L202535	u5200	m344	JACK	Damn...
L202256	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s just two kids, right?
L202255	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn?t the life I dreamt about.  Where?s the romance, where?s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can?t have...
L202252	u5200	m344	JACK	Kate?s my wife...
L202251	u5195	m344	ARNIE	You see, it?s like we?re in each other?s heads...
L202250	u5195	m344	ARNIE	It?s not Kate, is it?
L202249	u5200	m344	JACK	I don?t think so.
L202248	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Trouble at work?
L202247	u5200	m344	JACK	Is it...?
L202246	u5195	m344	ARNIE	What am I saying?  You don?t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that?s all.  Is that you?
L202245	u5195	m344	ARNIE	I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
L202244	u5200	m344	JACK	I?m having kind of a bad day.
L202242	u5195	m344	ARNIE	Maybe I don?t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
L202241	u5200	m344	JACK	We?re friends, aren?t we?
L202237	u5200	m344	JACK	Great room...
L202236	u5195	m344	ARNIE	I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It?s throwin? everybody off.  What do you think?
L202445	u5200	m344	JACK	I mean it.  From what I can tell, we?re a mom and pop operation, we?re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
L202444	u5196	m344	BIG ED	C?mon Jack...
L202437	u5200	m344	JACK	I?ve got all the time in the world...
L202436	u5196	m344	BIG ED	Got a minute, Jack?
L202166	u5196	m344	BIG ED	The Caddy?  Why don?t you take your own damn car!
L202165	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it?ll be returned!
L202164	u5196	m344	BIG ED	What the hell are you talking about?  What?s he talking about?
L202163	u5200	m344	JACK	Where?s my car?!  Where?s my Ferrari!?
L202885	u5197	m344	CASH	You know what the word glimpse means, J? It?s by nature an impermanent thing.
L202884	u5200	m344	JACK	I?ve got kids, I?m going home...
L202883	u5197	m344	CASH	C?mon, Jack...
L202882	u5200	m344	JACK	You can?t do this. You can?t keep coming in and out of people?s lives, messing things up...
L202228	u5197	m344	CASH	Look Jack I?m late.  I?d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
L202227	u5200	m344	JACK	But what do I do?
L202226	u5197	m344	CASH	Do I look like I live in a bottle?
L202225	u5200	m344	JACK	What?s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
L202221	u5197	m344	CASH	Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
L202220	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s it?  That?s all I get?!  A glare?!
L202219	u5200	m344	JACK	Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
L202218	u5197	m344	CASH	Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
L202217	u5200	m344	JACK	Why not?
L202216	u5197	m344	CASH	Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn?t work like that and I can?t tell you why.
L202215	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, I just want my life back.  Now what?s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let?s talk turkey!  How much money...?
L202214	u5197	m344	CASH	As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
L202213	u5200	m344	JACK	How much time?!
L202212	u5197	m344	CASH	Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
L202211	u5200	m344	JACK	I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
L202210	u5197	m344	CASH	Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ?em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ?em take a lot longer...
L202209	u5200	m344	JACK	I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
L202208	u5197	m344	CASH	It?s a glimpse, Jacko.
L202207	u5200	m344	JACK	Please.  Just tell me what?s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
L202206	u5197	m344	CASH	You?  What about me?  I?m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
L202205	u5200	m344	JACK	Give me my goddamn life back!
L202204	u5197	m344	CASH	Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You?re making a business deal...
L202203	u5200	m344	JACK	You mean because you thought I was cocky I?m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
L202202	u5197	m344	CASH	No?  C?mon, Jack...I?ve got everything I need, I don?t have regrets, that?s just not for me... sound familiar?
L202201	u5200	m344	JACK	Brought what on myself?! I didn?t do anything!
L202200	u5197	m344	CASH	Look, I don?t know what you?re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
L202198	u5200	m344	JACK	What the hell is happening to me?!
L202197	u5197	m344	CASH	Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
L202195	u5197	m344	CASH	Basically, it?s my car now.  Get in.
L202194	u5200	m344	JACK	What?!
L202193	u5197	m344	CASH	It?s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
L202192	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s my car!  You stole my car!
L202191	u5197	m344	CASH	Miss me, Jack?
L202142	u5197	m344	CASH	Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
L202141	u5200	m344	JACK	Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
L202140	u5197	m344	CASH	You still think this is about me, don't you?
L202139	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
L202138	u5197	m344	CASH	Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
L202137	u5200	m344	JACK	I've got everything I need.
L202136	u5197	m344	CASH	You just said everyone needs something.
L202135	u5200	m344	JACK	Me?
L202134	u5197	m344	CASH	Yeah?  What do you need?
L202133	u5200	m344	JACK	Everyone needs something.
L202132	u5197	m344	CASH	Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
L202131	u5197	m344	CASH	Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
L202130	u5200	m344	JACK	I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
L202129	u5197	m344	CASH	Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
L202128	u5200	m344	JACK	I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
L202127	u5197	m344	CASH	You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
L202126	u5200	m344	JACK	What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
L202125	u5200	m344	JACK	Hey...
L202124	u5197	m344	CASH	Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
L202123	u5200	m344	JACK	I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
L202122	u5197	m344	CASH	So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
L202120	u5197	m344	CASH	A lucky streak, huh?
L202119	u5200	m344	JACK	There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
L202118	u5197	m344	CASH	You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
L202117	u5197	m344	CASH	"I call all you white guys ""Jack."""
L202116	u5200	m344	JACK	How'd you know my name was Jack?
L202114	u5197	m344	CASH	Damn, you are the real thing...
L202113	u5200	m344	JACK	Like I said, it's a business deal...
L202112	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
L202111	u5197	m344	CASH	Yes you do...
L202110	u5200	m344	JACK	No.
L202109	u5197	m344	CASH	DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
L202100	u5208	m344	SAM WONG	Get out!
L202099	u5197	m344	CASH	You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
L202098	u5208	m344	SAM WONG	You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
L202096	u5208	m344	SAM WONG	Get out, I call 911.
L202095	u5197	m344	CASH	What!?  Look at the ticket...!
L202094	u5208	m344	SAM WONG	You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
L202093	u5197	m344	CASH	What're you talkin' about?
L202092	u5208	m344	SAM WONG	Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
L202091	u5197	m344	CASH	...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
L202556	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Okay, you?re right, we?ve been dancing around this for years...
L202555	u5200	m344	JACK	It would help me if we were.
L202554	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Are we finally being honest?
L202553	u5200	m344	JACK	Is there something going on between us?
L202552	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Are we what, Jack?
L202551	u5200	m344	JACK	Are we...?
L202548	u5200	m344	JACK	You?re a nurse?
L202547	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Need a nurse?
L202546	u5200	m344	JACK	Something like that.
L202545	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
L202544	u5200	m344	JACK	Evelyn, right?
L202321	u5200	m344	JACK	Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
L202320	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Mushroom puffs aren?t the only thing I do well...
L202316	u5198	m344	EVELYN	C?mon, as soon as I put them down, you?re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
L202315	u5200	m344	JACK	I don?t think so, thank you...
L202314	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Finger food...?
L202304	u5198	m344	EVELYN	I thought I saw you notice it at the kids? recital.
L202303	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s lovely...
L202302	u5198	m344	EVELYN	Like the dress...?
L202186	u5200	m344	JACK	Maybe you?re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
L202185	u5199	m344	FRANK	I don?t care who you are.  It?s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
L202184	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, I don?t know what?s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
L202183	u5199	m344	FRANK	Mr. Mintz?  I don?t think so...building?s closed pal.  You?ll have to come back tomorrow.
L202182	u5200	m344	JACK	Frank.  Where?s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
L202181	u5199	m344	FRANK	Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
L202086	u5200	m344	JACK	Thanks.  To you too...
L202085	u5199	m344	FRANK	Merry Christmas to you, sir...
L202084	u5199	m344	FRANK	Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
L202083	u5200	m344	JACK	I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
L202750	u5202	m344	KENNY	Okay, chief.
L202749	u5200	m344	JACK	Why don?t you let me take this one, Kenny?
L202742	u5202	m344	KENNY	You want me to handle him?  I think I?m ready...
L202741	u5200	m344	JACK	If you?re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
L202740	u5202	m344	KENNY	Kate?s on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
L202419	u5200	m344	JACK	Well, I?m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
L202418	u5202	m344	KENNY	Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you?re okay?
L202417	u5200	m344	JACK	I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
L202416	u5202	m344	KENNY	Uh huh...
L202415	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s the kind of thing you can really build on...
L202414	u5202	m344	KENNY	No, I didn?t...that?s great.
L202413	u5200	m344	JACK	...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
L202406	u5200	m344	JACK	Thank you.
L202405	u5202	m344	KENNY	Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
L202404	u5200	m344	JACK	Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
L202172	u5209	m344	TONY THE DOORMAN	Uh-huh...
L202171	u5200	m344	JACK	What are you talking about?  It?s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
L202170	u5209	m344	TONY THE DOORMAN	Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
L202026	u5200	m344	JACK	Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
L202025	u5209	m344	TONY THE DOORMAN	About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I?m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
L202024	u5200	m344	JACK	How?d you do this year, Tony?
L202023	u5209	m344	TONY THE DOORMAN	Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
L203003	u5200	m344	JACK	We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
L203002	u5201	m344	KATE	Don?t do this, Jack... But he continues...
L202999	u5201	m344	KATE	What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
L202998	u5200	m344	JACK	Please. Let?s just go have a cup of coffee. That?s all I?m asking for. I?m sure there?s another flight to Paris tonight.
L202997	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack.
L202996	u5200	m344	JACK	Don?t get on that plane!
L202995	u5201	m344	KATE	Jesus, Jack...
L202994	u5200	m344	JACK	You can?t go!
L202982	u5200	m344	JACK	Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
L202981	u5201	m344	KATE	No, Jack, I never got married. You?
L202980	u5200	m344	JACK	You?re not married, are you?
L202979	u5201	m344	KATE	Not with what they pay me...
L202978	u5200	m344	JACK	So you?re not at a non- profit firm?
L202977	u5201	m344	KATE	That?s the one...
L202976	u5200	m344	JACK	To Paris. Paris, France.
L202975	u5201	m344	KATE	Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I?m going to be heading it up.
L202974	u5200	m344	JACK	You?re moving...
L202968	u5200	m344	JACK	Paris?
L202967	u5201	m344	KATE	I?m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It?s a box marked ?Jack.?  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
L202966	u5200	m344	JACK	What?s going on?
L202965	u5201	m344	KATE	Don?t worry about it, Jack...
L202964	u5200	m344	JACK	I'm sorry...
L202962	u5201	m344	KATE	It?s good to see you...
L202961	u5200	m344	JACK	You look great.
L202960	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack...God, it?s been so long...You look...
L202959	u5200	m344	JACK	Kate...
L202900	u5201	m344	KATE	I promise. Come to bed, honey.
L202899	u5200	m344	JACK	Promise me again...
L202898	u5201	m344	KATE	I promise, Jack...
L202897	u5200	m344	JACK	Please, just promise me you?ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don?t, then it?s like it never happened and I don?t think I could live with that.
L202896	u5201	m344	KATE	Are you okay, Jack?
L202895	u5200	m344	JACK	I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
L202894	u5201	m344	KATE	You?ve been Jack Campbell.  And that?s always a good thing...
L202893	u5200	m344	JACK	But I?ve done some good things too, haven?t I?
L202892	u5201	m344	KATE	It?s been interesting, that?s for sure.
L202851	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, you?re making this into something it?s not. This isn?t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It?s a step forward...  Don?t you see?  I?m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
L202850	u5201	m344	KATE	Don?t do that...
L202848	u5201	m344	KATE	Then get a goddamn snow blower!
L202847	u5200	m344	JACK	I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
L202843	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack.
L202842	u5200	m344	JACK	No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
L202841	u5201	m344	KATE	I can?t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn?t want to raise the kids here?
L202840	u5200	m344	JACK	This is New York City, it?s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren?t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
L202839	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
L202838	u5200	m344	JACK	I?m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
L202837	u5201	m344	KATE	Annie goes to a great school.
L202836	u5200	m344	JACK	I don?t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We?ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
L202835	u5201	m344	KATE	Are you out of your mind?
L202832	u5201	m344	KATE	What are you talking about, Jack?
L202831	u5200	m344	JACK	You?re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
L202830	u5200	m344	JACK	A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
L202829	u5201	m344	KATE	A perk for what?
L202828	u5200	m344	JACK	This place is a perk, Kate.
L202827	u5201	m344	KATE	For the week?
L202826	u5200	m344	JACK	Think bigger.
L202825	u5201	m344	KATE	So what?s the big surprise? You didn?t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
L202824	u5201	m344	KATE	It?s like a museum.
L202823	u5200	m344	JACK	Pretty incredible, isn?t it?
L202734	u5200	m344	JACK	I don?t think I?d fight you on that one...
L202733	u5201	m344	KATE	I could stay here forever...
L202729	u5201	m344	KATE	That?s all I wanted to hear...
L202728	u5200	m344	JACK	My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
L202727	u5201	m344	KATE	I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
L202726	u5200	m344	JACK	You?re so...beautiful...
L202724	u5201	m344	KATE	Way out...
L202723	u5200	m344	JACK	I?m out of the doghouse?
L202722	u5201	m344	KATE	I don?t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
L202721	u5200	m344	JACK	I?ll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
L202720	u5201	m344	KATE	You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
L202717	u5201	m344	KATE	What are you sure about?
L202716	u5200	m344	JACK	Good things...
L202712	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s wonderful...
L202711	u5201	m344	KATE	Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
L202710	u5201	m344	KATE	God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
L202709	u5200	m344	JACK	I guess...some of them are probably faking.
L202708	u5201	m344	KATE	I mean yes, I help people that need it...
L202707	u5200	m344	JACK	Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
L202706	u5201	m344	KATE	My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you?ve seen my pay check.
L202705	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s a big one for me, too.
L202704	u5201	m344	KATE	C?mon, Jack, you think there aren?t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I?m doing in New Jersey...
L202703	u5200	m344	JACK	But you always seem so certain.
L202702	u5201	m344	KATE	I think it?s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It?s very human.
L202700	u5200	m344	JACK	Now...I don?t...
L202699	u5201	m344	KATE	And now...?
L202698	u5200	m344	JACK	I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
L202697	u5200	m344	JACK	No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
L202696	u5201	m344	KATE	Worse, you mean...
L202695	u5200	m344	JACK	I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
L202693	u5200	m344	JACK	Are you sure?
L202692	u5201	m344	KATE	Now I?m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we?ll deal with it.
L202691	u5200	m344	JACK	I think it may help us but there?s a slight chance it could make things worse.
L202690	u5201	m344	KATE	Okay...
L202689	u5200	m344	JACK	I need to tell you something.
L202680	u5200	m344	JACK	But I?m gettin? close, right?
L202679	u5201	m344	KATE	You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
L202672	u5201	m344	KATE	How do you even know about this place?
L202671	u5200	m344	JACK	What?s the difference? I?m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
L202670	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack...can we afford all this?
L202641	u5200	m344	JACK	I?ll fix it.  I?ll go out right now and get you something.  I?ll make it right.
L202640	u5201	m344	KATE	You actually forgot our anniversary.
L202638	u5200	m344	JACK	I know that, but...
L202637	u5201	m344	KATE	What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it?s light out.
L202636	u5200	m344	JACK	Here?s the thing.  I really hadn?t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary?s good all day...
L202634	u5201	m344	KATE	Enjoy it, sweetheart...
L202633	u5200	m344	JACK	You really are incredible...
L202632	u5200	m344	JACK	Zeena...
L202631	u5201	m344	KATE	I found it at an outlet store.  I know it?s a knock-off, but I think it?ll look great on you...
L202630	u5201	m344	KATE	No, open it...
L202629	u5200	m344	JACK	Maybe I should wait...
L202613	u5200	m344	JACK	Wait a minute.  You?re my wife?
L202612	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack.
L202604	u5200	m344	JACK	What? You make me hot...
L202603	u5201	m344	KATE	Nice, Jack.  You?re sweeping me off my feet.
L202602	u5200	m344	JACK	Not it...?
L202600	u5200	m344	JACK	Oh yeah, you?re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I?m gonna take you to that special place...
L202599	u5201	m344	KATE	Then say it...just say it to me...!
L202598	u5200	m344	JACK	Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
L202597	u5201	m344	KATE	C?mon, you know what I like to hear...
L202596	u5200	m344	JACK	What...?
L202595	u5201	m344	KATE	Say it, Jack...
L202593	u5201	m344	KATE	It?s good, right?
L202592	u5200	m344	JACK	Thank you...
L202591	u5200	m344	JACK	I want it...
L202590	u5201	m344	KATE	You want the cake!?
L202588	u5201	m344	KATE	Sorry, Jack.  It?s too important to me.
L202587	u5200	m344	JACK	C?mon.
L202583	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
L202582	u5201	m344	KATE	You mean this chocolate cake?
L202581	u5200	m344	JACK	Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where?s that chocolate cake...?
L202580	u5201	m344	KATE	How was the game, honey?
L202533	u5200	m344	JACK	How would you look at it?
L202532	u5201	m344	KATE	If you want to look at it that way...
L202531	u5200	m344	JACK	Our life in a nutshell...
L202528	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s why I work for Big Ed?
L202527	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would?ve happened if you hadn?t stepped in at the store.
L202526	u5200	m344	JACK	You had a heart attack?
L202525	u5201	m344	KATE	The trek out to the hospital every day didn?t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
L202524	u5201	m344	KATE	You can?t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
L202523	u5200	m344	JACK	Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why?d we ever leave?
L202522	u5201	m344	KATE	We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
L202521	u5200	m344	JACK	No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn?t we?
L202520	u5201	m344	KATE	Good, Jack.  Maybe we?ll keep her.
L202519	u5200	m344	JACK	Sure.  I really like Annie.
L202518	u5201	m344	KATE	I think it worked out okay, don?t you?
L202517	u5200	m344	JACK	Surprise.  We?re pregnant...  Yeah...that must?ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
L202516	u5201	m344	KATE	Well...Annie for one.
L202510	u5201	m344	KATE	Maybe you?re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn?t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that?s what it?s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids? college fund.
L202509	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, I?m sorry.  I?m sorry I was such a saint before and I?m such a prick now.  Maybe I?m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
L202507	u5200	m344	JACK	I can?t believe it?s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could?ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
L202506	u5201	m344	KATE	It?s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
L202505	u5200	m344	JACK	What?s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
L202504	u5201	m344	KATE	Really.
L202503	u5200	m344	JACK	I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I?m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I?m sick of it.
L202502	u5200	m344	JACK	I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
L202501	u5201	m344	KATE	Excuse me?
L202500	u5200	m344	JACK	Do you have any idea what my life is like?
L202499	u5201	m344	KATE	No?
L202497	u5201	m344	KATE	Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  C?mon, take it off.  We?ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
L202496	u5200	m344	JACK	She got those shoes...
L202495	u5201	m344	KATE	$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
L202494	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I?m gonna buy it...
L202493	u5201	m344	KATE	I mean...wow...off the charts great.
L202481	u5201	m344	KATE	Look at me like you haven?t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
L202480	u5200	m344	JACK	Do what?
L202479	u5201	m344	KATE	How can you do that?
L202478	u5200	m344	JACK	I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there?s no question about that.  But this...  ...you?ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
L202477	u5201	m344	KATE	This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
L202476	u5200	m344	JACK	No, I?m serious...you?re really stunning...
L202475	u5201	m344	KATE	Thanks, Jack...
L202473	u5200	m344	JACK	Whatever you say...honey.
L202472	u5201	m344	KATE	It?s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you?re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don?t have time for wining and dining.
L202471	u5200	m344	JACK	Shouldn?t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
L202470	u5201	m344	KATE	That is the general idea, yes...
L202469	u5200	m344	JACK	Wait a second.  You want me, don?t you?
L202467	u5200	m344	JACK	I?m working on a new deal now...
L202466	u5201	m344	KATE	I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
L202465	u5200	m344	JACK	Hey!  I was watching that!
L202464	u5200	m344	JACK	Well that?s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
L202463	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
L202356	u5201	m344	KATE	And...?
L202355	u5200	m344	JACK	Uh...that baby?s crying...
L202354	u5200	m344	JACK	HEY!
L202353	u5201	m344	KATE	...my feet are hurtin?...
L202352	u5200	m344	JACK	Hello!
L202342	u5201	m344	KATE	You?re having a bad day, I?ll go with you...actually, there?s no way in hell you?re gettin? me back out there...
L202341	u5200	m344	JACK	But it?s twenty degrees outside...
L202340	u5201	m344	KATE	Fine, she?s the kid?s dog.  Let?s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
L202339	u5200	m344	JACK	No, she?s not.
L202338	u5201	m344	KATE	She?s your dog, Jack.
L202337	u5200	m344	JACK	You?re kidding me...
L202336	u5201	m344	KATE	Here you go...
L202334	u5200	m344	JACK	Pro bono.  You don?t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
L202333	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack...
L202327	u5201	m344	KATE	Uh huh...
L202326	u5200	m344	JACK	Yes, I?m fine.  It?s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
L202299	u5201	m344	KATE	Funny, Jack.  I?m laughing on the inside.
L202298	u5200	m344	JACK	Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
L202296	u5201	m344	KATE	Because you?ll be here.
L202295	u5200	m344	JACK	Why not?
L202294	u5201	m344	KATE	Telling my mother she doesn?t have to stay with the kids.
L202293	u5200	m344	JACK	What are you doing?
L202291	u5200	m344	JACK	Trust me on this Kate.  I really don?t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
L202290	u5201	m344	KATE	You look forward to this party all year.  What?s with you today?
L202289	u5200	m344	JACK	Party?  Oh no, I can?t go to a party...
L202288	u5201	m344	KATE	Look, we don?t have time for this right now, we?ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You?re not wearing that to the Thompsons? party. I don?t care how hilarious you think it is...
L202279	u5200	m344	JACK	Look, you don?t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
L202278	u5201	m344	KATE	Jack...don?t even start...
L202277	u5200	m344	JACK	Because that?s where I live.
L202276	u5201	m344	KATE	The city?  New York City?  Why?
L202275	u5200	m344	JACK	I was in the city.
L202274	u5201	m344	KATE	Where were you?
L202273	u5200	m344	JACK	I don?t know!  Please stop yelling at me!
L202272	u5201	m344	KATE	What kind of man does that!?
L202268	u5200	m344	JACK	Yeah...fine.
L202267	u5201	m344	KATE	Are you okay?
L201993	u5200	m344	JACK	You hear me complaining about that?
L201992	u5201	m344	KATE	I can't seem to let go of you...
L201989	u5201	m344	KATE	We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
L201988	u5200	m344	JACK	No, you?re right.  What are we doing?
L201987	u5201	m344	KATE	Go. I?m sorry, you should just go...
L201986	u5200	m344	JACK	What?
L201985	u5201	m344	KATE	Right, for us. But...I?m afraid that if you get on that plane...
L201984	u5200	m344	JACK	For us, Kate.
L201983	u5201	m344	KATE	Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
L201982	u5200	m344	JACK	You mean don?t go at all? What about my internship?
L201981	u5201	m344	KATE	Don?t  go, Jack...
L201980	u5201	m344	KATE	I know we?ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
L201979	u5200	m344	JACK	About the plane? What do you think it?s gonna crash? Don?t say that...
L201978	u5201	m344	KATE	I have a bad feeling about this.
L201972	u5201	m344	KATE	I also put side two of London Calling on there...
L201971	u5200	m344	JACK	All in one tape?
L201970	u5201	m344	KATE	Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
L202180	u5200	m344	JACK	A shelter?!  I?m the richest guy in the building...I?ve got twice the square footage you have!
L202179	u5206	m344	MRS. PETERSON	And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let?s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
L202178	u5200	m344	JACK	Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I?ll be fine...
L202177	u5206	m344	MRS. PETERSON	No...
L202022	u5206	m344	MRS. PETERSON	You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
L202021	u5200	m344	JACK	It?s because I?m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
L202020	u5206	m344	MRS. PETERSON	Hello Jack.  You don?t have to stop singing on my account...
L202019	u5200	m344	JACK	Mrs. Peterson.
L202805	u5200	m344	JACK	Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You?re a scotch man, single malt, not because it?s trendy but because you?ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
L202804	u5203	m344	LASSITER	That?s easy. You?ve seen my car.
L202803	u5200	m344	JACK	For one thing, you like expensive things.
L202802	u5200	m344	JACK	You?re a little tougher, Peter.
L202801	u5203	m344	LASSITER	He certainly has your number, Alan.
L202767	u5200	m344	JACK	But you?re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
L202766	u5203	m344	LASSITER	...we?re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
L202753	u5200	m344	JACK	Not exactly. I?ve seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
L202752	u5203	m344	LASSITER	Do I know you?
L202751	u5200	m344	JACK	Peter Lassiter...
L202079	u5203	m344	LASSITER	Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
L202078	u5200	m344	JACK	Not by a long shot.
L202077	u5203	m344	LASSITER	You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
L202076	u5200	m344	JACK	Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
L202073	u5203	m344	LASSITER	Aspen.
L202072	u5200	m344	JACK	Where is he?
L202071	u5203	m344	LASSITER	I need you, tiger..
L202070	u5200	m344	JACK	Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
L202069	u5203	m344	LASSITER	Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
L202068	u5200	m344	JACK	That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
L202067	u5203	m344	LASSITER	I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
L202066	u5200	m344	JACK	And God love you for it.
L202065	u5203	m344	LASSITER	That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
L202064	u5200	m344	JACK	Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
L202919	u5200	m344	JACK	I?m sorry, no...
L202918	u5205	m344	MAN	Hey, my wife?s in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
L202917	u5205	m344	MAN	Is there anything I can do for you?
L202916	u5200	m344	JACK	No...I?m not...
L202915	u5205	m344	MAN	Hey, are you okay?
L202914	u5200	m344	JACK	Damn...damn...damn...
L202913	u5205	m344	MAN	Kate? No, there?s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
L202912	u5200	m344	JACK	Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
L202911	u5205	m344	MAN	Can I help you?
L202738	u5200	m344	JACK	You won?t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A?s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
L202737	u5205	m344	MAN	Okay, I?ll take them...
L202736	u5200	m344	JACK	For the money, they?re hands down the best radial we carry...
L202908	u5200	m344	JACK	Christmas?  It can?t be Christmas...
L202907	u5207	m344	PAULA	Merry Christmas...
L202906	u5200	m344	JACK	That?s totally see through...
L202017	u5200	m344	JACK	If it's something you feel strongly about.
L202016	u5207	m344	PAULA	Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
L202015	u5200	m344	JACK	I've got plenty of places to go.
L202014	u5207	m344	PAULA	Don't you have anywhere to go?
L202013	u5207	m344	PAULA	I'm taking the train...
L202012	u5200	m344	JACK	Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
L202011	u5207	m344	PAULA	I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
L202010	u5200	m344	JACK	So we'll get egg nog.
L202009	u5207	m344	PAULA	It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
L202008	u5200	m344	JACK	Tonight.
L202007	u5207	m344	PAULA	I'd like that, too.
L202006	u5200	m344	JACK	I want to see you again.
L202005	u5207	m344	PAULA	Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
L202004	u5200	m344	JACK	You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
L202003	u5207	m344	PAULA	Last night was great...
L202002	u5200	m344	JACK	Of course I did.
L202001	u5207	m344	PAULA	Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
L202986	u5204	m344	LORI	Congratulations. The La Guardia flight?s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
L202985	u5201	m344	KATE	I found it!
L202984	u5201	m344	KATE	Yes!
L202983	u5204	m344	LORI	I?ll go for a cup of coffee!
L202973	u5204	m344	LORI	Maybe it?s by the wardrobe boxes...
L202972	u5201	m344	KATE	You didn?t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
L202971	u5204	m344	LORI	Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
L202970	u5201	m344	KATE	Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
L202969	u5204	m344	LORI	Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
L204598	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
L204597	u5219	m345	THE THING	I mean...
L204596	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I wouldn't know anything about that.
L204595	u5219	m345	THE THING	You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
L204593	u5219	m345	THE THING	This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
L204592	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship.
L204591	u5219	m345	THE THING	You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
L204797	u5211	m345	BEN	I like the sound of that.
L204796	u5210	m345	ALICIA	We're going to have to work on your touch.
L204590	u5210	m345	ALICIA	My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
L204589	u5211	m345	BEN	Those yours too?
L204588	u5211	m345	BEN	No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
L204587	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Relax, it's casual.
L204586	u5211	m345	BEN	I'm not really dressed for a party.
L204585	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
L204584	u5211	m345	BEN	How'd you know it was me?
L204457	u5211	m345	BEN	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
L204456	u5210	m345	ALICIA	Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
L204453	u5211	m345	BEN	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
L204452	u5210	m345	ALICIA	I don't think She's real big on hate.
L204794	u5211	m345	BEN	Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
L204793	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
L204784	u5211	m345	BEN	Got it, teach.
L204783	u5216	m345	REED	Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
L204650	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
L204649	u5211	m345	BEN	"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
L204647	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
L204646	u5216	m345	REED	We're working as hard as we can --
L204645	u5211	m345	BEN	Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
L204644	u5216	m345	REED	Ben --
L204525	u5216	m345	REED	This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
L204524	u5211	m345	BEN	It's about to be a broken face.
L204363	u5216	m345	REED	O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
L204362	u5211	m345	BEN	Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
L204361	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
L204360	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
L204359	u5216	m345	REED	Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
L204343	u5216	m345	REED	If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
L204342	u5211	m345	BEN	You got a chisel round here?
L204308	u5211	m345	BEN	Yeah, nine years straight.
L204307	u5216	m345	REED	We had a tough year.
L204263	u5211	m345	BEN	Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
L204262	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  Are you okay?
L204261	u5211	m345	BEN	What the --!
L204165	u5211	m345	BEN	I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
L204164	u5216	m345	REED	Are you alright?
L204137	u5211	m345	BEN	Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
L204136	u5216	m345	REED	He's smart, powerful, successful --
L204135	u5211	m345	BEN	I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
L204134	u5216	m345	REED	What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
L204133	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
L204132	u5216	m345	REED	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
L204131	u5211	m345	BEN	You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
L204129	u5216	m345	REED	I should have done more, run more tests --
L204128	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
L204127	u5216	m345	REED	I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
L204125	u5211	m345	BEN	Solid.
L204124	u5216	m345	REED	Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
L204123	u5211	m345	BEN	How long was I out?
L204059	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
L204058	u5211	m345	BEN	I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
L204025	u5211	m345	BEN	<u>Should</u>?
L204024	u5216	m345	REED	The shields on the station should protect us.
L204005	u5216	m345	REED	Victor's better at these things.
L204004	u5211	m345	BEN	This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
L204003	u5216	m345	REED	He's made a few changes.
L204002	u5211	m345	BEN	Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
L203982	u5211	m345	BEN	This makes five.
L203981	u5216	m345	REED	I had it at four.
L203980	u5211	m345	BEN	Five times.
L203979	u5216	m345	REED	When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
L203978	u5216	m345	REED	I'm sure he's matured since then.
L203977	u5211	m345	BEN	They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
L203976	u5216	m345	REED	Youthful high spirits.
L203975	u5211	m345	BEN	No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
L203974	u5216	m345	REED	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
L203973	u5211	m345	BEN	Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
L203961	u5211	m345	BEN	I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
L203960	u5216	m345	REED	We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
L203959	u5211	m345	BEN	Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
L203958	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
L203957	u5211	m345	BEN	He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
L203948	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
L203947	u5211	m345	BEN	What about his first born?
L203933	u5216	m345	REED	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
L203932	u5211	m345	BEN	I can't take this.
L203917	u5211	m345	BEN	You'd never know it.
L203916	u5216	m345	REED	He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
L203915	u5216	m345	REED	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
L203914	u5211	m345	BEN	Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
L204807	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
L204806	u5211	m345	BEN	No more cracks about how I look.
L204724	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
L204723	u5211	m345	BEN	The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
L204661	u5211	m345	BEN	Go back to the drawing board.
L204660	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
L204091	u5211	m345	BEN	Give me the god damn mirror!
L204090	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
L204089	u5211	m345	BEN	Give me a mirror...
L204088	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
L204087	u5211	m345	BEN	What's wrong with me?
L204086	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
L204085	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed? ... Sue?
L204084	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
L204083	u5211	m345	BEN	Where...where am I?
L204039	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Don't you wander off, boy.
L204038	u5211	m345	BEN	Put your tiny little mind at ease.
L204037	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
L204036	u5211	m345	BEN	Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
L204035	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
L204034	u5211	m345	BEN	'Course not.  Strictly business.
L204033	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
L204017	u5211	m345	BEN	Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
L204016	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
L204011	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
L204010	u5211	m345	BEN	What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
L204441	u5211	m345	BEN	I already got it.  Everything I want.
L204440	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	What did you wish for, honey?
L204225	u5211	m345	BEN	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
L204224	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
L204223	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Baby, you're scaring me.
L204222	u5211	m345	BEN	"Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
L204221	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Ben?
L204219	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
L204218	u5211	m345	BEN	Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
L204009	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
L204008	u5211	m345	BEN	Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
L204007	u5212	m345	DEBBIE	Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
L204006	u5211	m345	BEN	I'll be watching over you.
L204694	u5211	m345	BEN	And you can?  Power it up?
L204693	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
L204692	u5220	m345	VICTOR	He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
L204691	u5211	m345	BEN	Reed said it'd be weeks till --
L204690	u5220	m345	VICTOR	To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
L204689	u5211	m345	BEN	What do you want, Vic?
L204686	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
L204685	u5211	m345	BEN	What is this?  Where's Reed?
L204684	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Ben, come in.
L204634	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
L204633	u5211	m345	BEN	About me?  How sweet.
L204632	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm worried about you.
L204631	u5211	m345	BEN	What are <u>you</u> doing here?
L204726	u5211	m345	BEN	Victor must've taken him.
L204725	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>Where is Reed</u>?
L204543	u5218	m345	SUE	No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
L204542	u5211	m345	BEN	It's easy for you to be patient.
L204541	u5218	m345	SUE	Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
L204540	u5211	m345	BEN	It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
L204539	u5218	m345	SUE	He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
L204500	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
L204499	u5211	m345	BEN	Oh, he did.
L204498	u5218	m345	SUE	He didn't.
L204396	u5211	m345	BEN	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
L204395	u5218	m345	SUE	The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
L204394	u5211	m345	BEN	You look like an eighties rock band.
L204345	u5211	m345	BEN	Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
L204344	u5218	m345	SUE	We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
L204160	u5211	m345	BEN	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
L204159	u5218	m345	SUE	I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
L204023	u5211	m345	BEN	Is it safe?
L204022	u5218	m345	SUE	We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
L203986	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor did.
L203985	u5211	m345	BEN	I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
L203968	u5218	m345	SUE	I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
L203967	u5211	m345	BEN	Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
L204414	u5220	m345	VICTOR	That's terrible news...
L204413	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
L204411	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
L204410	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What?
L204409	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
L204408	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"What do you mean ""complete""?"
L204407	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
L204406	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
L204405	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
L204404	u5220	m345	VICTOR	And they're changing into...
L204403	u5213	m345	DOCTOR	Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
L204778	u5216	m345	REED	<u>Now</u>.
L204777	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	But all these people...
L204776	u5216	m345	REED	Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
L204535	u5216	m345	REED	A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
L204534	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
L204533	u5216	m345	REED	You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
L204445	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Right, whatever, have fun.
L204444	u5216	m345	REED	That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
L204398	u5216	m345	REED	They're not costumes.
L204397	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
L204367	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
L204366	u5216	m345	REED	What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
L204365	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
L204364	u5216	m345	REED	Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
L204357	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
L204356	u5216	m345	REED	Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
L204351	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I can go hotter!
L204350	u5216	m345	REED	Back it down, Johnny!
L204321	u5216	m345	REED	...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
L204320	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
L204319	u5216	m345	REED	We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
L204310	u5216	m345	REED	Oh, it is.
L204309	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
L204288	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
L204287	u5216	m345	REED	Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
L204255	u5216	m345	REED	You've been working out.
L204254	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	This is wrong in so many ways.
L204199	u5216	m345	REED	Ben, are you there?
L204198	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
L204190	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
L204189	u5216	m345	REED	The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
L204188	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
L204081	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Ben!  Ben!
L204080	u5216	m345	REED	He's not responsive --
L204074	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What about you?
L204073	u5216	m345	REED	Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
L204146	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
L204145	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Not this again --
L204144	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	You're on fire!
L204143	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	Last one down springs for room service.
L204142	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I though we went over this.
L204141	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	Stay right.  Left is trouble.
L204140	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Me like-y.
L204122	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
L204121	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
L204120	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
L204119	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	I mean, you feel a little feverish.
L204118	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	So are you!
L204117	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	You're hot!
L204109	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --"
L204108	u5217	m345	SEXY NURSE	And where do we think we're going?
L204736	u5218	m345	SUE	But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
L204735	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
L204734	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing --
L204721	u5218	m345	SUE	No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
L204720	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
L204668	u5218	m345	SUE	As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
L204667	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
L204666	u5218	m345	SUE	Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
L204665	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
L204664	u5218	m345	SUE	"Is that what you call it?  ""<i>Real</i>""?"
L204663	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
L204662	u5218	m345	SUE	Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
L204531	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Blockhead started it!
L204530	u5218	m345	SUE	You two need a time-out.
L204523	u5218	m345	SUE	"You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
L204522	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
L204519	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Dude.  That's my sister.
L204518	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm driving.
L204506	u5218	m345	SUE	<u>Girl</u>...?!
L204505	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
L204355	u5218	m345	SUE	That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
L204354	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Sweet.
L204353	u5218	m345	SUE	You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
L204352	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	You're really cramping my style here.
L204318	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
L204317	u5218	m345	SUE	Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
L204316	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
L204205	u5218	m345	SUE	I think that thing is Ben.
L204204	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	What is that <i>thing</i>?
L204197	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	"Okay, ""mom."""
L204196	u5218	m345	SUE	Stop it.
L204195	u5218	m345	SUE	Johnny.
L204194	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
L204192	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
L204191	u5218	m345	SUE	Apparently I can disappear.
L203988	u5214	m345	JOHNNY	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203987	u5218	m345	SUE	The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L204231	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
L204230	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Front page?
L204229	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L204228	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
L204158	u5220	m345	VICTOR	"<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not <u>mine</u>."""
L204157	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
L204156	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
L204155	u5215	m345	LEONARD	You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L204154	u5220	m345	VICTOR	And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
L204153	u5215	m345	LEONARD	"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
L204152	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L204151	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L204150	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L204149	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L204148	u5220	m345	VICTOR	How's the IPO?
L204021	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
L204020	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Leonard, how's the feed?
L203999	u5220	m345	VICTOR	History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203998	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Then what is it?
L203997	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
L203996	u5215	m345	LEONARD	Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203995	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Showtime.
L203994	u5215	m345	LEONARD	They're ready for you, sir.
L203956	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203955	u5215	m345	LEONARD	And if he's not...?
L203954	u5220	m345	VICTOR	If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L204566	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
L204565	u5216	m345	REED	But I'm not done with the machine --
L204564	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L204563	u5216	m345	REED	What are you doing here?
L204338	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
L204337	u5216	m345	REED	Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L204336	u5220	m345	VICTOR	<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
L204335	u5216	m345	REED	<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L204334	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
L204331	u5216	m345	REED	Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L204330	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L204211	u5216	m345	REED	He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
L204210	u5220	m345	VICTOR	<u>Ben</u> did this?
L204209	u5216	m345	REED	Ben did this.
L204208	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
L204067	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L204066	u5216	m345	REED	Not until Ben is back inside!
L204063	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Reed, we're running out of time.
L204062	u5216	m345	REED	Come on, Ben, come on...
L204056	u5220	m345	VICTOR	So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
L204055	u5216	m345	REED	Ben's still out there --
L204054	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
L204053	u5216	m345	REED	We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
L204032	u5216	m345	REED	Sure.
L204031	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203953	u5216	m345	REED	Hilarious.
L203952	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203946	u5220	m345	VICTOR	The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
L203945	u5216	m345	REED	You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203942	u5216	m345	REED	Not at all.
L203941	u5220	m345	VICTOR	This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203929	u5216	m345	REED	You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
L203928	u5220	m345	VICTOR	But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L204800	u5218	m345	SUE	A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
L204799	u5216	m345	REED	I found a broken gasket, from space --
L204781	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204780	u5216	m345	REED	Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L204675	u5218	m345	SUE	You <u>need</u> a doctor.
L204674	u5216	m345	REED	The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
L204673	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L204672	u5216	m345	REED	I can...make it work.
L204622	u5218	m345	SUE	That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L204621	u5216	m345	REED	Why didn't you say something?
L204620	u5218	m345	SUE	When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L204619	u5218	m345	SUE	I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
L204618	u5216	m345	REED	You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L204615	u5218	m345	SUE	I gave him twenty.
L204614	u5216	m345	REED	You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L204613	u5218	m345	SUE	Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L204612	u5216	m345	REED	You <u>were</u>?
L204611	u5218	m345	SUE	Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
L204610	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
L204609	u5216	m345	REED	I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L204578	u5216	m345	REED	<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L204577	u5218	m345	SUE	Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
L204576	u5216	m345	REED	Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
L204575	u5218	m345	SUE	Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
L204574	u5216	m345	REED	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L204573	u5218	m345	SUE	Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L204492	u5216	m345	REED	No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
L204491	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
L204426	u5216	m345	REED	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
L204425	u5218	m345	SUE	And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
L204424	u5216	m345	REED	Of course.  Of course.
L204423	u5218	m345	SUE	But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
L204422	u5216	m345	REED	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L204421	u5218	m345	SUE	And reverse the mutations --
L204420	u5216	m345	REED	If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L204419	u5216	m345	REED	The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L204418	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing?
L204389	u5218	m345	SUE	No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L204388	u5216	m345	REED	There were a lot of variables to consider --
L204387	u5218	m345	SUE	I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L204386	u5216	m345	REED	I think it was a little more complicated than --
L204385	u5218	m345	SUE	Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L204384	u5216	m345	REED	No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
L204383	u5218	m345	SUE	Are you kidding?
L204382	u5216	m345	REED	I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
L204381	u5216	m345	REED	What in the world would give me that idea?
L204380	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L204378	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204377	u5216	m345	REED	Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
L204376	u5218	m345	SUE	Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
L204375	u5216	m345	REED	I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L204374	u5218	m345	SUE	Excuse me?
L204373	u5216	m345	REED	You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L204369	u5218	m345	SUE	What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L204368	u5216	m345	REED	"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge."
L204315	u5218	m345	SUE	If it happened to him, then it could...
L204314	u5216	m345	REED	That's what we're here to find out.
L204313	u5218	m345	SUE	How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L204253	u5218	m345	SUE	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
L204252	u5216	m345	REED	Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
L204250	u5216	m345	REED	We need to get past them.
L204249	u5218	m345	SUE	What?
L204187	u5216	m345	REED	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
L204186	u5218	m345	SUE	It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
L204184	u5216	m345	REED	Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
L204183	u5218	m345	SUE	What?  What do you mean you --
L204182	u5216	m345	REED	Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
L204177	u5218	m345	SUE	You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
L204176	u5216	m345	REED	For science.
L204175	u5216	m345	REED	Passion.
L204174	u5218	m345	SUE	Which was?
L204173	u5216	m345	REED	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
L204172	u5218	m345	SUE	You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
L204170	u5218	m345	SUE	You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
L204169	u5216	m345	REED	That's good.  That's uh...good.
L204168	u5218	m345	SUE	Yes, thanks.
L204167	u5216	m345	REED	Feeling better?
L203991	u5218	m345	SUE	Great minds think alike.
L203990	u5216	m345	REED	Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
L203972	u5218	m345	SUE	Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
L203971	u5216	m345	REED	As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
L203970	u5218	m345	SUE	It's been changed.
L203969	u5216	m345	REED	I, uh, think I remember the number.
L203966	u5218	m345	SUE	Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
L203965	u5216	m345	REED	Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
L203964	u5218	m345	SUE	I was talking about us.  Working together.
L203963	u5216	m345	REED	Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
L203940	u5218	m345	SUE	Never better.
L203939	u5216	m345	REED	You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
L204472	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
L204471	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Oh, I think you already have.
L204470	u5218	m345	SUE	Please don't make this personal --
L204469	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
L204468	u5218	m345	SUE	If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
L204467	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L204466	u5218	m345	SUE	He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L204464	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Susan.  What are you doing?
L204463	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L204462	u5220	m345	VICTOR	It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
L204461	u5218	m345	SUE	You said it was urgent.
L204326	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
L204325	u5218	m345	SUE	I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L204324	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
L204323	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, your scar --
L204214	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Just <u>find</u> him.
L204213	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, I'm sorry I --
L204207	u5218	m345	SUE	Victor, are you feeling alright?
L204206	u5220	m345	VICTOR	What's going on?
L204070	u5218	m345	SUE	You can't leave them out there.
L204069	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Raising the shields.
L204068	u5218	m345	SUE	What are you doing?
L204050	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L204049	u5218	m345	SUE	Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L204048	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L204047	u5218	m345	SUE	It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L204042	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L204041	u5218	m345	SUE	I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
L204040	u5220	m345	VICTOR	Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
L203936	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
L203935	u5218	m345	SUE	It's just business.
L204641	u5219	m345	THE THING	Skeptical...?
L204640	u5220	m345	VICTOR	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
L204639	u5219	m345	THE THING	Reed's gonna fix me up --
L204638	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
L204637	u5219	m345	THE THING	If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
L204636	u5220	m345	VICTOR	I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
L204635	u5219	m345	THE THING	'Scuse me.
L272921	u5802	m384	HERBERT	Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
L272920	u5804	m384	JULIET	Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
L272919	u5802	m384	HERBERT	This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
L272913	u5802	m384	HERBERT	I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
L272912	u5804	m384	JULIET	Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
L272911	u5802	m384	HERBERT	I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
L272910	u5802	m384	HERBERT	We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
L272909	u5804	m384	JULIET	I adore anything to do with the arts.
L272903	u5804	m384	JULIET	I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
L272902	u5802	m384	HERBERT	What's that?
L272901	u5804	m384	JULIET	"Mummy has a special technique called ""Deep Therapy."""
L273282	u5803	m384	HONORA	Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
L273281	u5802	m384	HERBERT	wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
L273278	u5802	m384	HERBERT	Have a nice outing, you lot.
L273277	u5803	m384	HONORA	Bye.
L273276	u5802	m384	HERBERT	pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
L273275	u5802	m384	HERBERT	I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
L273222	u5803	m384	HONORA	breaks down into heavy sobs.
L273221	u5802	m384	HERBERT	accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
L273212	u5803	m384	HONORA	She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
L273211	u5802	m384	HERBERT	What now?
L273210	u5803	m384	HONORA	I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
L273209	u5802	m384	HERBERT	is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
L273109	u5803	m384	HONORA	Is it hurting, dear?
L273108	u5802	m384	HERBERT	waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
L273089	u5803	m384	HONORA	frowns at Henry.
L273088	u5802	m384	HERBERT	No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
L273087	u5802	m384	HERBERT	sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
L273086	u5803	m384	HONORA	Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
L272986	u5802	m384	HERBERT	Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
L272985	u5803	m384	HONORA	pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
L272984	u5803	m384	HONORA	I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
L272889	u5803	m384	HONORA	whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
L272888	u5802	m384	HERBERT	Look who I've found!
L272887	u5803	m384	HONORA	and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
L272886	u5802	m384	HERBERT	Come on through.
L272885	u5803	m384	HONORA	Come on! Sausage rolls.
L272809	u5802	m384	HERBERT	sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
L272808	u5803	m384	HONORA	I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
L272807	u5803	m384	HONORA	playfully shoves his hand away.
L272806	u5802	m384	HERBERT	Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
L273298	u5803	m384	HONORA	looks down at the ground in front of her.
L273297	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Look, Mother!
L273290	u5803	m384	HONORA	Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
L273289	u5805	m384	PAULINE	You have it.
L273272	u5803	m384	HONORA	That's enough, Yvonne!
L273271	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
L273197	u5803	m384	HONORA	Love, you can still write to each other.
L273196	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
L273193	u5803	m384	HONORA	stands and walks toward the door.
L273192	u5805	m384	PAULINE	You have to let me go!
L273191	u5803	m384	HONORA	You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
L273190	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
L273189	u5803	m384	HONORA	Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
L273188	u5805	m384	PAULINE	The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
L273168	u5803	m384	HONORA	Open this door!
L273167	u5805	m384	PAULINE	 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
L273128	u5803	m384	HONORA	All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
L273127	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I don't wanna be in bloody school!
L273126	u5803	m384	HONORA	You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
L273125	u5803	m384	HONORA	is very angry.
L273124	u5805	m384	PAULINE	What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
L273123	u5803	m384	HONORA	These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
L273122	u5803	m384	HONORA	snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
L273121	u5803	m384	HONORA	You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
L273120	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I'm educating myself!
L273119	u5803	m384	HONORA	I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
L273118	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Who cares!
L273117	u5803	m384	HONORA	She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
L273116	u5805	m384	PAULINE	What does old Stew want?
L273115	u5803	m384	HONORA	It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
L273114	u5805	m384	PAULINE	My name is Gina!
L273061	u5803	m384	HONORA	steps back.
L273060	u5805	m384	PAULINE	You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
L273059	u5803	m384	HONORA	whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
L273058	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Well, I guess I take after you then!
L273057	u5803	m384	HONORA	My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
L273055	u5803	m384	HONORA	grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
L273054	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Can I go now?
L273053	u5803	m384	HONORA	sighs.
L273052	u5803	m384	HONORA	If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
L273051	u5803	m384	HONORA	From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
L273050	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
L272982	u5803	m384	HONORA	Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
L272981	u5805	m384	PAULINE	But she'll have no one to look after her!
L272980	u5803	m384	HONORA	Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
L272979	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
L272978	u5803	m384	HONORA	holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
L272977	u5803	m384	HONORA	You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
L272976	u5803	m384	HONORA	starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
L272975	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I just want to be on my own for a while.
L272974	u5803	m384	HONORA	You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
L272973	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I'm not hungry.
L272972	u5803	m384	HONORA	Come on, sit up.
L272971	u5803	m384	HONORA	comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
L272970	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
L272915	u5803	m384	HONORA	leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
L272914	u5805	m384	PAULINE	He's the manager!
L272820	u5803	m384	HONORA	glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
L272819	u5805	m384	PAULINE	 Got an A, Mum!
L272818	u5803	m384	HONORA	Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
L272817	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Hello!
L273292	u5803	m384	HONORA	I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
L273291	u5804	m384	JULIET	But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
L273258	u5803	m384	HONORA	Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
L273257	u5804	m384	JULIET	Fruit.
L273256	u5803	m384	HONORA	turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
L273255	u5803	m384	HONORA	is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
L273254	u5804	m384	JULIET	Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
L273253	u5803	m384	HONORA	Oh-what a nice outfit!
L273252	u5803	m384	HONORA	Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
L273251	u5804	m384	JULIET	Hello!
L273017	u5804	m384	JULIET	Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
L273016	u5803	m384	HONORA	stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
L273015	u5803	m384	HONORA	We don't want to tire you out, dear.
L273014	u5804	m384	JULIET	I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
L273013	u5803	m384	HONORA	looks startled at the outburst.
L273012	u5804	m384	JULIET	"They sent me off to the Bahamas ""for the good of my health."" They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands ""for the good of my health."""
L273011	u5803	m384	HONORA	I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
L273010	u5803	m384	HONORA	gives her a sympathetic look.
L273009	u5804	m384	JULIET	I'm saving them for a rainy day.
L273004	u5804	m384	JULIET	I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
L273003	u5803	m384	HONORA	That's coming along well!
L273002	u5804	m384	JULIET	Thank you so much!
L273001	u5803	m384	HONORA	It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
L273000	u5803	m384	HONORA	hurries over.
L272999	u5804	m384	JULIET	I'm so happy to see you!
L272899	u5804	m384	JULIET	Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
L272898	u5803	m384	HONORA	I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
L272895	u5804	m384	JULIET	Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
L272894	u5803	m384	HONORA	I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
L272893	u5803	m384	HONORA	and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
L272892	u5804	m384	JULIET	And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
L273285	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
L273284	u5804	m384	JULIET	Isn't it beautiful!
L273280	u5804	m384	JULIET	Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
L273279	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Bye, Dad.
L273266	u5804	m384	JULIET	I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
L273265	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
L273264	u5804	m384	JULIET	Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
L273263	u5805	m384	PAULINE	It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
L273261	u5804	m384	JULIET	All right, then.
L273260	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
L273244	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Mummy!
L273243	u5804	m384	JULIET	Mummy!
L273232	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I know what to do about mother.
L273231	u5804	m384	JULIET	Yes . . .
L273230	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I'm coming with you.
L273204	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I need my sodding parents' consent.
L273203	u5804	m384	JULIET	But that's not true! I've got one.
L273159	u5804	m384	JULIET	Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
L273158	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Poor Father . . .
L273157	u5804	m384	JULIET	Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
L273156	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
L273155	u5804	m384	JULIET	Poor Mother was completely taken in.
L273152	u5804	m384	JULIET	That was what we were led to believe . . .
L273151	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
L273145	u5804	m384	JULIET	That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
L273144	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
L273143	u5804	m384	JULIET	This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
L273142	u5804	m384	JULIET	They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
L273141	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
L273140	u5804	m384	JULIET	I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
L273139	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Just a couple more . . .
L273138	u5804	m384	JULIET	Hurry up! I'm freezing!
L273137	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
L273133	u5804	m384	JULIET	You mean travel by ourselves?
L273132	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Let's go overseas . . .
L273131	u5804	m384	JULIET	No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
L273130	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I think I'm going crazy.
L273028	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
L273027	u5804	m384	JULIET	How do you know? Did he tell you?
L273026	u5804	m384	JULIET	That idiot boarder?
L273025	u5805	m384	PAULINE	John has fallen in love with me!
L273024	u5804	m384	JULIET	What??
L273023	u5805	m384	PAULINE	You'll never guess what's happened!!
L272953	u5804	m384	JULIET	I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
L272952	u5805	m384	PAULINE	You're such an incredible woman.
L272951	u5804	m384	JULIET	I shall call him Diello.
L272944	u5805	m384	PAULINE	What???
L272943	u5804	m384	JULIET	It's so beautiful!
L272942	u5805	m384	PAULINE	What?
L272929	u5804	m384	JULIET	God, yes!
L272928	u5805	m384	PAULINE	He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
L272874	u5805	m384	PAULINE	That . . .
L272873	u5804	m384	JULIET	That.
L272872	u5805	m384	PAULINE	This . . .
L272871	u5804	m384	JULIET	This.
L272870	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Him . . .
L272869	u5804	m384	JULIET	Him.
L272868	u5805	m384	PAULINE	He . . .
L272867	u5804	m384	JULIET	To be known as He!
L272866	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Saint Mario!
L272865	u5804	m384	JULIET	James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
L272863	u5804	m384	JULIET	I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
L272862	u5805	m384	PAULINE	But, we're all going to Heaven!
L272861	u5804	m384	JULIET	Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
L272860	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
L272853	u5804	m384	JULIET	Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
L272852	u5805	m384	PAULINE	I think I'm dying . . .
L272844	u5804	m384	JULIET	Of course it matters! It's Mario!
L272843	u5805	m384	PAULINE	It doesn't matter.
L272842	u5804	m384	JULIET	0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
L272771	u5804	m384	JULIET	Somebody's got to help us!

L272768	u5805	m384	PAULINE	Mummy!
L272767	u5804	m384	JULIET	Mummy!
L281491	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
L281490	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
L281489	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
L281488	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
L281487	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
L281486	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
L281485	u5865	m388	ROBBERY DETECTIVE	No joke, Lieutenant.
L281484	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
L281493	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.
L281492	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	You didn't see this.  Understand?
L281474	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
L281473	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
L281472	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	They appear to be authentic.
L281471	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What do you think?
L281464	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Talk to me about what?
L281463	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
L281462	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
L281461	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Lieutenant?
L281454	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Not now.  I'm busy.
L281453	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Lieutenant Bedsoe?
L281680	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	So?
L281679	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
L281678	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Why?
L281677	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	I think it was England.
L281676	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	He had to come from somewhere.
L281675	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
L281674	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Anything from the bank?
L281521	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
L281520	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	We don't have any proof of that.
L281519	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	This ties in with Nash.
L281518	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
L281517	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Tough.
L281516	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
L281515	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
L281482	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I'd like you to see this.
L281481	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
L281480	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
L281479	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
L281478	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
L281477	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What is it?
L281476	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
L281384	u5852	m388	DETECTIVE GRELEY	Yeah -- how'd you know that?
L281383	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
L281451	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
L281450	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
L281449	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	It's circumstantial.
L281448	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
L281447	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
L281446	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	What?
L281445	u5850	m388	CAPTAIN	Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
L281444	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
L281814	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
L281813	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Yes -- I think it is.
L281791	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Most people are afraid of death.
L281790	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
L281789	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Maybe he was a lousy shot.
L281788	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
L281787	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It's late.
L281786	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
L281785	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
L281784	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
L281783	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Good evening, Lieutenant.
L281459	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Get outta here.
L281458	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
L281457	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
L281456	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Is that it?
L281455	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
L281443	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
L281442	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	You sure?
L281441	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.
L281440	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
L281439	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	No.
L281438	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
L281437	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	She was a good woman.
L281435	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	And Brenda?
L281434	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Around.
L281433	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Where have you been for the last seven years?
L281432	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.  I don't scare easy.
L281431	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
L281430	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Central Park.
L281429	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
L281428	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I already told you.  I took a walk.
L281427	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Where were you last night around nine?
L281425	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
L281424	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	A few days ago.
L281423	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	When did you get back?
L281420	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Congratulations.
L281419	u5849	m388	BEDSOE	Lieutenant.
L281418	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Detective Bedsoe.
L281626	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	No -- after you.
L281625	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You can go first.
L281619	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You always get to go first.
L281618	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That doesn't matter.
L281617	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I stood up first.
L281616	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No -- I will.
L281615	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I'll go first.
L281602	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It's done.
L281601	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Well?
L281581	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
L281580	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.  What am I to do?
L281579	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
L281578	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
L281577	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
L281576	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
L281575	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You.
L281574	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	What worries you?
L281573	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Yes.
L281562	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Then she should be an excellent dancer.
L281561	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	She's the King's cousin.
L281560	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	To ask her to dance.
L281557	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
L281556	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Living.  Remember?
L281555	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	What are we doing here?
L281503	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Me?  Of course.
L281502	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
L281501	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	How long is the voyage?
L281500	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	France.
L281499	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
L281498	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
L281380	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
L281379	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	If it came down to it what would you do?
L281378	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That is a thought that doesn't please me.
L281377	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
L281376	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	As friends -- always as friends.
L281375	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I'm sure they will.
L281374	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
L281373	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	For what?
L281372	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Thank you, Thomas.
L281371	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Then it's worth the journey.
L281370	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Maybe myself.
L281369	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	And what do you think you will find in another land?
L281368	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
L281367	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Leaving what?
L281366	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm leaving.
L281362	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
L281361	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That is what bothers me.
L281360	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
L281359	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Yes.
L281358	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	That's all?
L281357	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	The river.
L281356	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	What else?  What else do you hear right now?
L281355	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I hear you.
L281354	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
L281353	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You?
L281352	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
L281351	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Can't you enjoy it quietly?
L281350	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
L281349	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Sing.
L281348	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	What?
L281347	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Must you do that?
L281311	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
L281310	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
L281308	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
L281307	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
L281306	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
L281305	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
L281297	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
L281296	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I learned my fill from Romeriz.
L281295	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
L281294	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Who are you?
L281293	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
L281292	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
L281291	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You?
L281290	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye.
L281289	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
L281288	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	Caution shows wisdom.
L281287	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
L281286	u5851	m388	CAVANAUGH	You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
L281250	u5853	m388	FARMER	How?
L281249	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I would like to say goodbye.
L281248	u5853	m388	FARMER	Agreed.
L281247	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
L281246	u5853	m388	FARMER	This cannot be.
L281238	u5853	m388	FARMER	I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
L281237	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
L281236	u5853	m388	FARMER	She'll soon be of age.
L281235	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	She's a treasure she is.
L281234	u5853	m388	FARMER	I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
L281231	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I think you just like to eat dirt.
L281230	u5853	m388	FARMER	What do you think?
L281229	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Can you really tell from doing that?
L281228	u5853	m388	FARMER	It will be a good harvest this year.
L281188	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	I lied.
L281187	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	We had a bargain.  You promised.
L281180	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	How?
L281179	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	Your life.
L281178	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
L281177	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
L281176	u5854	m388	HOODED MAN	Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
L281175	u5868	m388	VIEIRA	How comes it your are not afraid?
L281597	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
L281596	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why are you doing this?
L281595	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Where I'm going you cannot follow.
L281594	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Then take me with you.
L281593	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye.
L281592	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Do you love me, Conner?
L281591	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I cannot explain.
L281590	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why?
L281589	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You'll no see me again.
L281588	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Leaving?  For how long?
L281587	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm leaving in the morning.
L281586	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why not?
L281585	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I cannot stay.
L281570	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
L281569	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
L281568	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Sometimes.
L281567	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	The past?
L281566	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Different places.
L281565	u5855	m388	ISABELLE	Where do you go when your mind drifts?
L281564	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye?
L281277	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
L281276	u5864	m388	REPORTER	No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
L281275	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You guys are from the British museum, right?
L281274	u5864	m388	REPORTER	What are you hoping to find inside?
L281273	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Huge.
L281272	u5864	m388	REPORTER	Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
L281271	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
L281822	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Sounds very -- normal.
L281821	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
L281820	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	What now?
L281802	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Conner?
L281801	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Be careful, Conner.
L281800	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Get out.
L281799	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	He's in there!
L281782	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He will not stop until it is over.
L281781	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Must you fight him?
L281780	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It will end tonight.
L281779	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Where will you go now?
L281778	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
L281777	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	And the other one -- he is like you?
L281776	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
L281772	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You?
L281771	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
L281770	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	How did you know that?
L281769	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
L281768	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	On the back it has--
L281767	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I've seen it.
L281766	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Would you like to see it?
L281761	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Not unless they're immortal.
L281760	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
L281759	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	--for three hundred years.
L281758	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
L281757	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
L281756	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
L281755	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
L281754	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	So?
L281753	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
L281752	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You don't really believe this do you?
L281751	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
L281750	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why not?
L281749	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	No.
L281748	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
L281741	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why don't you tell me.
L281740	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
L281739	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
L281738	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes -- it is.
L281737	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Is it?
L281736	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
L281735	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That makes you uncomfortable?
L281734	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I wanted to get to know you better.
L281733	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	How come you wanted to meet tonight?
L281732	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
L281731	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You're not an easy person to get to know.
L281730	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I've lived all over the world.
L281729	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I'm just trying to place you.
L281728	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why?
L281727	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
L281726	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I know.
L281725	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You didn't answer my question.
L281721	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Sorry.
L281720	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You're twenty minutes late.
L281719	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Good evening.
L281705	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
L281704	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why?
L281703	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Meet me Tratino's at nine.
L281702	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.
L281700	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You look like you have.
L281699	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	No.
L281698	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Have you ever heard of the Calan?
L281697	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'm interested in mythology.
L281696	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
L281695	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	About what?
L281694	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
L281693	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	New York is dangerous place.
L281692	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Do you always walk around with a sword?
L281691	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Then how did he know your name?
L281690	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't know.
L281689	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Who was that man last night?
L281688	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't have any answers for you.
L281686	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You remind me of someone I used to know.
L281685	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why do you stare at me like that?
L281684	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Jennifer.
L281683	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
L281652	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't know anymore.
L281651	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Then who's Russell Nash?
L281650	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Because it's my name.
L281649	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
L281648	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I'll be fine.
L281647	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	You're hurt.
L281549	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
L281548	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Where did you get it?
L281546	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why?  What's going on?
L281545	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
L281544	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	If it's good advice.
L281543	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
L281542	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
L281541	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	You got me.
L281540	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
L281539	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
L281538	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
L281537	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	A lucky guess.
L281536	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.  How did you know?
L281535	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	In the highlands?
L281534	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
L281533	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Corpses?
L281531	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
L281530	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	To talk to you.
L281529	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	What do you want?
L281528	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	No.  I'm an archaeologist.
L281527	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Are you a cop?
L281526	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I was wondering if I could talk to you?
L281525	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I remember you.
L281524	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
L281393	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	We'll see.
L281392	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
L281391	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I like my work.
L281390	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
L281389	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I know, Paul.
L281388	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
L281387	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I was working on the cataloging.
L281386	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	You stayed here again last night?
L281328	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	And this?
L281327	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	It has to be.
L281326	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I don't think it is a duplication.
L281325	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
L281323	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	His head.  Someone cut it off.
L281322	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	What's that next to him?
L281321	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	We found him this morning.
L281320	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	I don't know.
L281319	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	How could they get by him?
L281318	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
L281316	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	What?  How?
L281315	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Someone broke into the cavern last night.
L281314	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Why?
L281313	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	We're holding the workers down below.
L281281	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
L281280	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
L281279	u5856	m388	JENNIFER	Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
L281278	u5862	m388	PROFESSOR DAJORSKI	Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
L281202	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
L281201	u5861	m388	OLD MAN	It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
L281200	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
L281198	u5857	m388	KILVARA	I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
L281197	u5861	m388	OLD MAN	I do not know -- and even if I did...
L281196	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
L281195	u5861	m388	OLD MAN	It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
L281194	u5857	m388	KILVARA	It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
L281643	u5857	m388	KILVARA	You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
L281642	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It will not end tonight.
L281641	u5857	m388	KILVARA	It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
L281640	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Why did you wait?
L281639	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
L281637	u5857	m388	KILVARA	The Kurgan was a pussy.
L281636	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	That's what the Kurgan said.
L281635	u5857	m388	KILVARA	I am stronger than you, Highlander.
L281634	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	This cannot be.
L281633	u5857	m388	KILVARA	Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
L281227	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	Me too.
L281226	u5863	m388	RACHEL	I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
L281225	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
L281224	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Is there anything else you need?
L281223	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	I don't know.
L281222	u5863	m388	RACHEL	How can that be?
L281221	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	No.
L281220	u5863	m388	RACHEL	It isn't over, is it, Conner?
L281216	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	I can take care of myself.
L281215	u5863	m388	RACHEL	The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
L281214	u5858	m388	MACLEOD	I know.
L281213	u5863	m388	RACHEL	You know it's not safe here for you.
L281258	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
L281257	u5866	m388	SARAH	I'll no forget you.
L281256	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
L281255	u5866	m388	SARAH	I love you, Conner.
L281254	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
L281253	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	It's not for me to decide.
L281252	u5866	m388	SARAH	Don't leave us, Conner.
L281233	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Aye -- that I would, lass.
L281232	u5866	m388	SARAH	Would you care for some water, Conner?
L281664	u5863	m388	RACHEL	If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
L281663	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
L281662	u5863	m388	RACHEL	And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
L281661	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
L281660	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
L281659	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	My dreams died long ago.
L281658	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.

L281655	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
L281654	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Why?
L281653	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.

L281553	u5863	m388	RACHEL	What will you do?
L281552	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Fine.
L281551	u5863	m388	RACHEL	I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
L281415	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
L281414	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
L281413	u5863	m388	RACHEL	Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
L281412	u5859	m388	MCCLEOD	I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.

L294039	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
L294038	u5957	m395	ADDISON	I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
L294037	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
L294036	u5957	m395	ADDISON	Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?

L293408	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
L293407	u5957	m395	ADDISON	My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
L293842	u5968	m395	MOSES	Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
L293841	u5958	m395	AMY	...Hello?
L293840	u5958	m395	AMY	I'm plenty happy!
L293839	u5968	m395	MOSES	Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
L293838	u5958	m395	AMY	I'm happy enough.
L293837	u5968	m395	MOSES	I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
L293836	u5958	m395	AMY	Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
L293835	u5968	m395	MOSES	Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
L293834	u5958	m395	AMY	It's hardly the same --
L293833	u5968	m395	MOSES	An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
L293832	u5958	m395	AMY	Well, maybe I --
L293831	u5968	m395	MOSES	...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
L293829	u5968	m395	MOSES	'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
L293828	u5958	m395	AMY	Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
L293827	u5968	m395	MOSES	But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
L293826	u5958	m395	AMY	That smart?!
L293825	u5968	m395	MOSES	Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
L293824	u5958	m395	AMY	So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
L293823	u5968	m395	MOSES	I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
L293822	u5958	m395	AMY	Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
L293821	u5968	m395	MOSES	Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
L293820	u5958	m395	AMY	But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
L293819	u5968	m395	MOSES	Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
L293818	u5958	m395	AMY	Who are you? How did you know who I am?
L294141	u5958	m395	AMY	Muncie!
L294140	u5972	m395	SMITTY	You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
L294139	u5958	m395	AMY	Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
L294134	u5958	m395	AMY	But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
L294133	u5972	m395	SMITTY	-- and she's dynamite!
L293847	u5958	m395	AMY	I know they're gonna buy that stock --
L293846	u5972	m395	SMITTY	Ol' satchel-butt...

L293777	u5972	m395	SMITTY	Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
L293776	u5958	m395	AMY	A sawbuck!
L293775	u5972	m395	SMITTY	He didn't offer you money.
L293774	u5958	m395	AMY	I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
L293761	u5958	m395	AMY	Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
L293760	u5972	m395	SMITTY	About seven minutes.
L293755	u5972	m395	SMITTY	Yeah.
L293754	u5958	m395	AMY	I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
L293752	u5958	m395	AMY	Lumbago.
L293751	u5972	m395	SMITTY	Adenoids?
L293750	u5958	m395	AMY	And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
L294184	u5958	m395	AMY	Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
L294183	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
L294182	u5958	m395	AMY	Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
L294181	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Hey! Where's that martini?!
L294180	u5958	m395	AMY	Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
L294179	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Barman! Set'm up, fella!
L294178	u5958	m395	AMY	Oh Norville, I --
L294177	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
L294176	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Huh?!
L294175	u5958	m395	AMY	Norville!
L294174	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...You son of a --
L294078	u5958	m395	AMY	Consider this my resignation --
L294077	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Now, Amy --
L294074	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Worked in a watch factory?
L294073	u5958	m395	AMY	Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
L294072	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
L294071	u5958	m395	AMY	Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
L294070	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
L294069	u5958	m395	AMY	Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
L294068	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
L294067	u5958	m395	AMY	...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
L294066	u5958	m395	AMY	You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
L294065	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
L294064	u5958	m395	AMY	Your i --
L294063	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
L294062	u5958	m395	AMY	You mean you know about this?
L294061	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
L294060	u5958	m395	AMY	They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
L294059	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
L294058	u5958	m395	AMY	...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
L294057	u5958	m395	AMY	Never mind about that...
L294056	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
L294055	u5958	m395	AMY	For Pete's sake, Norville!
L293941	u5958	m395	AMY	Sure, Norville, sure...
L293940	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
L293939	u5958	m395	AMY	Oh, Norville --
L293937	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
L293936	u5958	m395	AMY	Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
L293935	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
L293934	u5958	m395	AMY	I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
L293933	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
L293932	u5958	m395	AMY	Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
L293931	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
L293930	u5958	m395	AMY	Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
L293929	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
L293928	u5958	m395	AMY	What a beautiful thought.
L293927	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
L293926	u5958	m395	AMY	...The people look like ants.
L293925	u5958	m395	AMY	Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
L293924	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Every year?
L293923	u5958	m395	AMY	Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
L293922	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	You don't say.
L293921	u5958	m395	AMY	Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
L293920	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
L293919	u5958	m395	AMY	Oh yes! In Muncie!
L293918	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	You know, on farm route 17.
L293917	u5958	m395	AMY	...Huh?
L293916	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
L293915	u5958	m395	AMY	...Certain people are --
L293914	u5958	m395	AMY	Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
L293913	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
L293912	u5958	m395	AMY	I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
L293911	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
L293910	u5958	m395	AMY	...You do?
L293909	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I know that, Amy.
L293908	u5958	m395	AMY	Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
L293907	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
L293906	u5958	m395	AMY	...I'm sorry.
L293905	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
L293904	u5958	m395	AMY	Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
L293903	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Sid found me the icepack.
L293902	u5958	m395	AMY	Let me look.
L293901	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
L293900	u5958	m395	AMY	...What happened?
L293811	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
L293810	u5958	m395	AMY	Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
L293809	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
L293808	u5958	m395	AMY	Smitty.
L293807	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
L293806	u5958	m395	AMY	Oh, is that it!
L293805	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
L293804	u5958	m395	AMY	I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
L293803	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
L293802	u5958	m395	AMY	Confused?
L293800	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
L293799	u5958	m395	AMY	Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
L293798	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, she probably had a deadline...
L293797	u5958	m395	AMY	Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
L293796	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
L293795	u5958	m395	AMY	...Why don't I just type this up...
L293794	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...You know! For kids!
L293792	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
L293791	u5958	m395	AMY	Well, I --
L293790	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
L293789	u5958	m395	AMY	I'm sure I --
L293788	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
L293787	u5958	m395	AMY	Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
L293786	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
L293785	u5958	m395	AMY	-- or lack thereof?
L293784	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
L293783	u5958	m395	AMY	Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
L293782	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
L293745	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Please! Norville!
L293744	u5958	m395	AMY	Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
L293743	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
L293742	u5958	m395	AMY	Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
L293741	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
L293731	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
L293730	u5958	m395	AMY	Oh, no, really, I --
L293729	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
L293726	u5958	m395	AMY	Why yes, do you know it?
L293725	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	You're from Muncie?!
L293714	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Mind if I join you?
L293713	u5958	m395	AMY	-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
L293712	u5958	m395	AMY	No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
L293711	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Cigarette?
L293709	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I myself --
L293708	u5958	m395	AMY	A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
L293707	u5958	m395	AMY	At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
L293706	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
L293705	u5958	m395	AMY	What a horrible little person.
L293696	u5958	m395	AMY	I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
L293695	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Hungry, anyway.
L293692	u5958	m395	AMY	The couch, please.
L293691	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Not at all. You're light as a feather.
L293690	u5958	m395	AMY	I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
L293617	u5964	m395	EDITOR	Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
L293616	u5958	m395	AMY	I filed it yesterday.
L293615	u5964	m395	EDITOR	Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
L293614	u5958	m395	AMY	...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
L293610	u5958	m395	AMY	Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
L293609	u5964	m395	EDITOR	Sez who?
L293608	u5958	m395	AMY	As a three-dollar bill.
L293607	u5964	m395	EDITOR	Phony, huh?
L293606	u5958	m395	AMY	I tell ya the guy's a phony.
L294144	u5963	m395	CHIEF	Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
L294143	u5958	m395	AMY	You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
L294142	u5963	m395	CHIEF	Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
L294136	u5958	m395	AMY	Says who?!
L294135	u5963	m395	CHIEF	Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
L294131	u5963	m395	CHIEF	He grins wolfishly.
L294130	u5958	m395	AMY	You can't print that!
L293858	u5958	m395	AMY	It's about a dimwitted editor who --
L293857	u5963	m395	CHIEF	Watch it, Archer --
L293856	u5958	m395	AMY	I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
L293855	u5963	m395	CHIEF	Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
L293854	u5958	m395	AMY	Muncie.
L293849	u5958	m395	AMY	I don't know...
L293848	u5963	m395	CHIEF	You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
L293845	u5963	m395	CHIEF	It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
L293844	u5958	m395	AMY	Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
L293843	u5963	m395	CHIEF	I can't print this!
L293477	u5959	m395	ANCIENT SORTER	Forty-eight years...
L293476	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	How long've you been down here?
L293475	u5959	m395	ANCIENT SORTER	Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
L293474	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
L293473	u5959	m395	ANCIENT SORTER	Terrific.
L293469	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
L293468	u5959	m395	ANCIENT SORTER	I'm sure you do.
L293467	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I got big ideas, though!
L293466	u5959	m395	ANCIENT SORTER	Tell me about it.
L293465	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Ya know, entry level!
L293464	u5959	m395	ANCIENT SORTER	Terrific.
L293463	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Just got hired today!
L294172	u5960	m395	BARMAN	Martinis are for squares, man.
L294171	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
L294170	u5960	m395	BARMAN	It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
L294169	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
L294168	u5960	m395	BARMAN	Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
L294167	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I thought you served misfits here!
L294166	u5960	m395	BARMAN	Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
L294165	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
L294283	u5967	m395	LOU	It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
L294282	u5961	m395	BENNY	...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
L294278	u5961	m395	BENNY	...Geez.
L294277	u5967	m395	LOU	...Geez.
L294276	u5961	m395	BENNY	This you're familia' with.
L294275	u5967	m395	LOU	This I know, Benny.
L294274	u5961	m395	BENNY	You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
L294273	u5967	m395	LOU	What the heck they doin'?
L294272	u5961	m395	BENNY	What the heck's she doin', Lou?
L294214	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	But Buzz --
L294213	u5962	m395	BUZZ	And Sid says you stole it!
L294212	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	But, Buzz, you know I never --
L294211	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Say, that was a swell idea!
L294210	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	But, Buzz --
L294209	u5962	m395	BUZZ	But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
L294208	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
L294207	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
L294206	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...It is?
L294205	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Nah, that's all forgotten.
L294204	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...You don't?
L294203	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
L294202	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
L294116	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
L294115	u5962	m395	BUZZ	I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
L294114	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
L294113	u5962	m395	BUZZ	I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
L294112	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Get up!
L294111	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
L294110	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
L294109	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Awwww, buddy --
L294108	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
L294107	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Wuddya mean, buddy?
L294106	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	An example must be made!
L294105	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
L294104	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
L294103	u5962	m395	BUZZ	But, buddy, you were --
L294102	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
L294101	u5962	m395	BUZZ	But, buddy --
L294100	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...say, the hula hoop such a success.
L294099	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
L294098	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Yeah, but, buddy --
L294097	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
L294096	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Huh?! But, buddy --
L294095	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...Why, this is worthless.
L294088	u5962	m395	BUZZ	I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
L294087	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
L293629	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
L293628	u5962	m395	BUZZ	My pleasure, sir.
L293505	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
L293504	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, I --
L293503	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
L293498	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
L293497	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I --
L293496	u5962	m395	BUZZ	Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
L293495	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
L293494	u5962	m395	BUZZ	...What's your pleasure, buddy?
L294266	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
L294265	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	...Yeah, go ahead.
L294263	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	-- tough titty toenails!
L294262	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
L294258	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
L294257	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
L294256	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
L294255	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Yes sir...
L294254	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
L294253	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Sir?
L294252	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	Well, why don't ya read it.
L294251	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Yessir.
L294250	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
L294249	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Geez, I --
L294248	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
L294247	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh, geez.
L294246	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
L294245	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
L294244	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
L294243	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Yes sir...
L294242	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
L294241	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Norville.
L294240	u5965	m395	HUDSUCKER	...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
L293740	u5966	m395	INTERCOM	I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
L293739	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
L293738	u5966	m395	INTERCOM	I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
L293737	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...Well, I'm not sure where I --
L293736	u5966	m395	INTERCOM	Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
L293735	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
L293734	u5966	m395	INTERCOM	Yeah?
L293733	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...This'll only take a moment.
L293871	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
L293870	u5969	m395	MRS. MUSSBURGER	Well, frankly, I...
L293868	u5969	m395	MRS. MUSSBURGER	Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
L293867	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I haven't had --
L293866	u5969	m395	MRS. MUSSBURGER	I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
L293865	u5969	m395	MRS. MUSSBURGER	Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
L293864	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
L293863	u5969	m395	MRS. MUSSBURGER	-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
L294124	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
L294123	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
L294122	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
L294121	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	How's that, Sid?
L294120	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
L294119	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Ya don't say.
L294118	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
L294117	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
L293971	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well... I'm for it...
L293970	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
L293642	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
L293641	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Finally.
L293640	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
L293639	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Damnit, where's my car!
L293638	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
L293637	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
L293636	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
L293635	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
L293634	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
L293625	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Lobby. We haven't got all day.
L293624	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
L293578	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
L293577	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	My God! The Bumstead contracts!
L293574	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Sir, my leg is on fire!
L293573	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
L293571	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	But, sir!
L293570	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Not that way! Through the door!
L293568	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
L293567	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
L293565	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
L293564	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
L293563	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!
L293562	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
L293561	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Get out of my sight.
L293560	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	But --
L293559	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Get your feet off that desk.
L293558	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	But, sir! --
L293557	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	You're fired.
L293556	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
L293555	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Not even behind your back?
L293554	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	No, sir.
L293553	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
L293552	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
L293551	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
L293550	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Hmmm.
L293549	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, I made the dean's list.
L293548	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
L293547	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	Well, I'm a college graduate --
L293546	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	...education, were you?
L293536	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Wait a minute!
L293535	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
L293528	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	You --
L293527	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
L293526	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I --
L293525	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
L293522	u5971	m395	NORVILLE	I --
L293521	u5970	m395	MUSSBURGER	...Who let you in?
L293686	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	She's damn good, Lou.
L293685	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	She's good, Bennie.
L293684	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	She is!
L293683	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	She isn't!
L293681	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	He don't look wise.
L293680	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	Maybe he's wise.
L293678	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	No, Bennie: Lumbago.
L293677	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	...adenoids.
L293676	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	...Her mother needs an operation...
L293675	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	She's got other problems, of course...
L293671	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	He notices.
L293670	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	Hello, Niagara.
L293669	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	Old Faithful.
L293668	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	Yellowstone.
L293667	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
L293666	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	He don't look wise.
L293665	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	Maybe he's wise.
L293664	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	...He's not noticing, Benny.
L293663	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	The mark notices.
L293662	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	...No money.
L293661	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	She looks in her purse...
L293660	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	...and awduhs a light lunch.
L293659	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	She sits down.
L293658	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	She finds him.
L293657	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	She's looking for her mark.
L293656	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
L293655	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
L293654	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	There's one in every story.
L293653	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	...Enter the dame.
L293652	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	Fah from it...
L293651	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	Ya get the special?
L293650	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
L293649	u5974	m395	VETERAN #2	Yeah, tell me about it.
L293648	u5973	m395	VETERAN #1	I got gas, Bennie.
L306113	u6010	m399	ARMAND	We are a pair, and that's what counts.
L306112	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
L306111	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Your melancholy eyes...
L306110	u6010	m399	ARMAND	You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
L306109	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You were their leader. They trusted you.
L306108	u6010	m399	ARMAND	I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
L306107	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And yet you knew what I would o.
L306106	u6010	m399	ARMAND	No.
L306105	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You didn't even warm them, did you?
L306103	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
L306102	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Louis, I swear I did not.
L306101	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
L306100	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You let them do it.
L306099	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
L306098	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
L306097	u6010	m399	ARMAND	I couldn't prevent it.
L306094	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
L306093	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
L306092	u6010	m399	ARMAND	I can't save her.
L306091	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Not without Claudia. Where is she?
L306090	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Follow me - that way - through my cell -
L306089	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Where is she? Where's Claudia?
L306032	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
L306031	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Lestat! You knew Lestat!
L306030	u6010	m399	ARMAND	A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
L306029	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes... My God...
L306028	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Are these not the answers you came for?
L306027	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
L306026	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And the vampires of the Theatre?
L306022	u6010	m399	ARMAND	How he must have loved you.
L306021	u6013	m399	LOUIS	That's what the one who made me said.
L306020	u6010	m399	ARMAND	You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
L306019	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We can do that?
L306018	u6010	m399	ARMAND	But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
L306017	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You said there were none.
L306016	u6010	m399	ARMAND	So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
L306015	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Then I leave too.
L306014	u6010	m399	ARMAND	It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
L306013	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We want no quarrel with him.
L306012	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
L306011	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Then blame the one who made her...
L306010	u6010	m399	ARMAND	I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
L306009	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But why?
L306008	u6010	m399	ARMAND	She is.
L306007	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
L306006	u6010	m399	ARMAND	If you say so. You are innocent.
L306005	u6013	m399	LOUIS	No, my beloved, my child.
L306004	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Your lover.
L306003	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
L306002	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Listen to me.
L306001	u6010	m399	ARMAND	I was waiting for you...
L305970	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Knew? You mean he is...
L305969	u6013	m399	LOUIS	He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
L305968	u6010	m399	ARMAND	The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
L305967	u6010	m399	ARMAND	You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
L305966	u6013	m399	LOUIS	My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
L305965	u6010	m399	ARMAND	None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
L305964	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
L305963	u6010	m399	ARMAND	I have not spoken to him...
L305962	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Then God does not exist...
L305961	u6010	m399	ARMAND	And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
L305960	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Perhaps...
L305959	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Then there is nothing.
L305958	u6010	m399	ARMAND	I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
L305957	u6010	m399	ARMAND	No.
L305956	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You mean we are not children of Satan?
L305955	u6010	m399	ARMAND	That is a picture, nothing more.
L305954	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
L305953	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Surely you know the one who made you...
L305952	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Who made us what we are?
L305951	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Nothing if not vampires...
L305950	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What are we?
L305949	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Ah! You have questions?
L305948	u6013	m399	LOUIS	So you have the answers...
L305947	u6010	m399	ARMAND	If there were a leader, I would be the one.
L305946	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Are you the leader of tis group?
L305945	u6010	m399	ARMAND	You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
L305944	u6010	m399	ARMAND	But how did you come into existence?
L305943	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We had feared we were the only ones...
L305942	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
L305940	u6010	m399	ARMAND	They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
L305939	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Your lips, they didn't move.
L305938	u6010	m399	ARMAND	Yes, and very beautiful.
L305937	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Monstrous.
L305804	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
L305803	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Louis, put me in my coffin...
L305802	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Don't Louis --
L305800	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
L305799	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Laudanum!
L305798	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	No. Laudanum.
L305797	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
L305796	u6012	m399	LESTAT	We forgive each other then?
L305795	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
L305794	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
L305791	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
L305790	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
L305789	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Stop pestering me then!
L305788	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
L305787	u6012	m399	LESTAT	What plans?
L305786	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
L305785	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Not you my dear.
L305784	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
L305783	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
L305782	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Is that supposed to frighten me?
L305781	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
L305780	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Does it?
L305779	u6012	m399	LESTAT	What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
L305734	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
L305733	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
L305731	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
L305730	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Stop her Louis!
L305729	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You made us what we are, didn't you?
L305727	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
L305726	u6012	m399	LESTAT	It will grow back again!
L305725	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	And if I cut my hair again?
L305724	u6012	m399	LESTAT	What you are? You would be something other than you are?
L305723	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
L305718	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
L305717	u6012	m399	LESTAT	But you're the fairest by far.
L305716	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I have. Or there would be twice as many.
L305715	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
L305714	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Is this my birthday?
L305713	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I didn't realise.
L305712	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
L305711	u6012	m399	LESTAT	What night? What do you mean?
L305710	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Why always on this night?
L305665	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
L305664	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I'm not your daughter.
L305658	u6012	m399	LESTAT	It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
L305657	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I want some more.
L305652	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
L305651	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	More.
L306066	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
L306065	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	What do you mean?
L306064	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
L306063	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It's only mortal death.
L306062	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	But if she dies...
L306061	u6013	m399	LOUIS	She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
L306049	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
L306048	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes...
L306047	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
L306045	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
L306044	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
L306043	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
L306042	u6013	m399	LOUIS	How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
L306000	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You really believe that?
L305999	u6013	m399	LOUIS	He can protect us, Claudia.
L305997	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Let him go, he said. Let him go.
L305996	u6013	m399	LOUIS	So you felt it too!
L305995	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
L305994	u6013	m399	LOUIS	That's not so.
L305993	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
L305992	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Never.
L305991	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
L305990	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Love?
L305989	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
L305988	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
L305987	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Do you think I would let them harm you?
L305986	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
L305985	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What danger?
L305984	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
L305933	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Be still!
L305932	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
L305918	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Yes, and very beautiful.
L305917	u6013	m399	LOUIS	This is monstrous!
L305911	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	And no one knows but us...
L305910	u6013	m399	LOUIS	This is no performance.
L305906	u6013	m399	LOUIS	No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
L305905	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	She's no vampire.
L305904	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	How devilishly clever.
L305903	u6013	m399	LOUIS	They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
L305901	u6013	m399	LOUIS	They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
L305900	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
L305899	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
L305898	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
L305884	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Come, Claudia...
L305883	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
L305882	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You know her?
L305881	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
L305880	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
L305878	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You are more beautiful than any of them.
L305877	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
L305876	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Claudia, you torture yourself.
L305875	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Or her, or her - or any of them?
L305872	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	But how will I ever know, Louis?
L305871	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
L305870	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You don't remember? Or you never knew.
L305869	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
L305868	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes.
L305867	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
L305865	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes...
L305864	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
L305863	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Still my beautiful child.
L305862	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	How do I look?
L305844	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Not yet.
L305843	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	The ship is sailing wihout us!
L305840	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	It is! Take the back stairwell -
L305839	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It can't be -
L305835	u6013	m399	LOUIS	The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
L305834	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	What was that?
L305831	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
L305830	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
L305829	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
L305828	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And you never cried -
L305827	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
L305825	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I can't. Go away from me.
L305824	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Louis, look at me.
L305823	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
L305822	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
L305821	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
L305819	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
L305818	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
L305817	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	The swamp...
L305816	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Don't mock, Claudia...
L305815	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
L305813	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
L305812	u6013	m399	LOUIS	He's dead, Claudia, dead.
L305810	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
L305809	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
L305776	u6013	m399	LOUIS	He'll never let us go.
L305775	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
L305747	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I took your life. He gave you another one.
L305746	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You both did it?
L305745	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
L305744	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You... fed on me?
L305738	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
L305737	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
L305736	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
L305735	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We're immortal. You've always known that.
L305721	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Why not?
L305720	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Claudia - don't -
L305719	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	You want me to be a doll forever?
L305700	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Sit still. It's not finished -
L305699	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Claudia! You did that?
L305698	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
L305697	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Why does he call you that?
L305696	u6013	m399	LOUIS	He jests.
L305695	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
L305694	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
L305693	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
L305692	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	The way I learn everything. By watching you.
L305691	u6013	m399	LOUIS	How did you learn to write, Claudia?
L305650	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What have you done?
L305649	u6011	m399	CLAUDIA	I want more.
L306145	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You have it...
L306144	u6012	m399	LESTAT	And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
L306143	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I tried...
L306142	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
L306141	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes. I remember...
L306140	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
L306139	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I have to go now Lestat...
L306138	u6012	m399	LESTAT	If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
L306137	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
L306136	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
L306135	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And they frighten you?
L306134	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
L306133	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It's only a siren...
L306132	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
L306131	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
L306130	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
L306129	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
L306128	u6013	m399	LOUIS	That's all past, Lestat.
L306127	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
L306126	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Don't try to speak... it's alright...
L306125	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
L306096	u6013	m399	LOUIS	CLAUDIA!!!
L306095	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
L306077	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Are you mad????
L306076	u6012	m399	LESTAT	No... You come back to me Louis...
L305806	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
L305805	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
L305677	u6013	m399	LOUIS	She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
L305676	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
L305663	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
L305662	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
L305661	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
L305656	u6012	m399	LESTAT	That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
L305655	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
L305646	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Lestat, what do you mean?
L305645	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
L305644	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
L305643	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I didn't want to kill her.
L305642	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
L305641	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Lestat!
L305640	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
L305639	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What are you saying?
L305638	u6012	m399	LESTAT	She's here, your wounded one.
L305637	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
L305636	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
L305635	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
L305634	u6012	m399	LESTAT	That and more.
L305633	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
L305632	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
L305631	u6013	m399	LOUIS	No...
L305630	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
L305617	u6012	m399	LESTAT	In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
L305616	u6013	m399	LOUIS	My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
L305615	u6012	m399	LESTAT	THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
L305614	u6013	m399	LOUIS	NO!!!
L305613	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Unless I make her one of us...
L305610	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You finish her - if you feel so much -
L305609	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Lestat - finish this -
L305606	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
L305605	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Why do you do this Lestat?
L305601	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I know. Let her alone.
L305600	u6013	m399	LOUIS	The girl, Lestat -
L305599	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
L305598	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Lestat, she's alive!!!!
L305597	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
L305596	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I don't pretend to know.
L305595	u6012	m399	LESTAT	What do you imagine you are Louis?
L305594	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
L305593	u6012	m399	LESTAT	What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
L305578	u6012	m399	LESTAT	And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
L305577	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We belong in hell.
L305576	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
L305575	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Where are we?
L305574	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
L305573	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You fool, what have you done?
L305561	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
L305560	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
L305559	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
L305558	u6013	m399	LOUIS	They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
L305556	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
L305555	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
L305554	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
L305553	u6012	m399	LESTAT	As did the one who made me.
L305552	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Paris? You came from Paris?
L305551	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
L305544	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I don't know any hell -
L305543	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
L305535	u6012	m399	LESTAT	The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
L305534	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I can't.
L305533	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Read her thoughts.
L305532	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But how do you know?
L305531	u6012	m399	LESTAT	The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
L305528	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
L305527	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Have you ever been caught?
L305521	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
L305520	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
L305519	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
L305518	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Fascination...
L305517	u6012	m399	LESTAT	There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
L305515	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
L305514	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I know. It gets cold so fast.
L305505	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Do you think so?
L305504	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
L305496	u6012	m399	LESTAT	The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
L305495	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And if I don't?
L305494	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
L305493	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
L305492	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It can't be...
L305491	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
L305480	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
L305479	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Dear God, what have I done?
L305478	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You have fed. You were made for this...
L305477	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What have I done?
L305475	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Forget the crucifix. Take him.
L305474	u6013	m399	LOUIS	The crucifix -
L305473	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Take him.
L305470	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I want a woman.
L305469	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Come, you're going to feed now.
L305467	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Dying?
L305466	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
L305464	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Sure...
L305463	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You're sure?
L305458	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes...
L305457	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Did I hear a yes?
L305453	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
L305452	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
L305451	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You really want to be with them?
L305450	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
L305449	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But why do you want me?
L305448	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
L305447	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I can't go through with it, I tell you.
L305446	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
L305445	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
L305444	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
L305443	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
L305442	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You've just done it -
L305441	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I can't do it.
L305440	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Let's call that a start.
L305437	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Call him.
L305436	u6013	m399	LOUIS	How do you mean, start?
L305435	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
L305430	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I want it!
L305429	u6012	m399	LESTAT	Vampires. We thrive on blood.
L305428	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Give it to me!!!
L305427	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
L305426	u6013	m399	LOUIS	NO!!!!!
L305425	u6012	m399	LESTAT	They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
L305424	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Diane!!!!
L305419	u6012	m399	LESTAT	I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
L305418	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What do you want from me?
L305415	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Why should I be?
L305414	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You're not afraid of anything, are you?
L305413	u6012	m399	LESTAT	And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
L305412	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
L305405	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes...
L305404	u6012	m399	LESTAT	You want death? Is it death you want?
L305403	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Then my luck would have changed.
L305402	u6012	m399	LESTAT	They would have killed you -
L306161	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
L306160	u6015	m399	MALLOY	No...
L306159	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
L306157	u6015	m399	MALLOY	If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
L306156	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
L306153	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
L306152	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It's over, I'm telling you...
L306151	u6015	m399	MALLOY	But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
L306150	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But it has. There is no more to tell.
L306149	u6015	m399	MALLOY	No... it can't end like that...
L306124	u6013	m399	LOUIS	He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
L306123	u6015	m399	MALLOY	Lestat escaped the fire!
L305858	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
L305857	u6015	m399	MALLOY	No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
L305856	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
L305855	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You found nothing?
L305847	u6013	m399	LOUIS	He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
L305846	u6015	m399	MALLOY	Did he die in the fire?
L305752	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
L305751	u6015	m399	MALLOY	And did you lose her? Did she go?
L305750	u6013	m399	LOUIS	How could I not? She had to know.
L305749	u6015	m399	MALLOY	But why did you tell her?
L305672	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
L305671	u6015	m399	MALLOY	He did it to make you stay with him!
L305670	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Shall we go on?
L305582	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
L305581	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You loved your wife, surely.
L305580	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Can a vampire feel love?
L305579	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You loved Yvette...
L305489	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
L305488	u6015	m399	MALLOY	What about coffins?
L305487	u6013	m399	LOUIS	The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
L305486	u6015	m399	MALLOY	The story about stakes through the heart?
L305485	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
L305484	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You can't look at them...
L305483	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Oh, that rumour about crosses?
L305482	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You said the slave had a crucifix...
L305391	u6013	m399	LOUIS	But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
L305390	u6015	m399	MALLOY	Yes.
L305389	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
L305388	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You're not lying to me, are you?
L305387	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
L305386	u6013	m399	LOUIS	The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
L305385	u6015	m399	MALLOY	How did you do that?
L305381	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
L305380	u6015	m399	MALLOY	But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
L305379	u6013	m399	LOUIS	We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
L305378	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
L305377	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
L305376	u6015	m399	MALLOY	You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
L305374	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Perhaps lucky for both of us.
L305373	u6015	m399	MALLOY	Well, what a lucky break for me.
L305372	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
L305371	u6015	m399	MALLOY	See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
L305370	u6013	m399	LOUIS	I'm a vampire.
L305369	u6015	m399	MALLOY	So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
L305368	u6013	m399	LOUIS	It's just a room...
L305367	u6015	m399	MALLOY	Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
L305366	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You followed me here, didn't you?
L305365	u6015	m399	MALLOY	So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
L305364	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
L305363	u6015	m399	MALLOY	That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
L305362	u6013	m399	LOUIS	So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
L306059	u6014	m399	MADELEINE	Yes!
L306058	u6013	m399	LOUIS	Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
L306057	u6014	m399	MADELEINE	My daughter...
L306056	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And the child who did die?
L306055	u6014	m399	MADELEINE	A child who can't die...
L306054	u6013	m399	LOUIS	What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
L306053	u6014	m399	MADELEINE	Yes.
L306052	u6013	m399	LOUIS	And you know what you ask for?
L306051	u6014	m399	MADELEINE	Yes...
L306050	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You promise to care for her then?
L306040	u6014	m399	MADELEINE	Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
L306039	u6013	m399	LOUIS	You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
L311714	u6059	m402	POTTER	So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
L311713	u6036	m402	BAILEY	Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family ?? no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
L311712	u6036	m402	BAILEY	Well, all right . . .
L311711	u6059	m402	POTTER	Are you running a business or a charity ward?
L311710	u6036	m402	BAILEY	But they're somebody's children.
L311707	u6036	m402	BAILEY	I can't do that. These families have children.
L311706	u6059	m402	POTTER	Then foreclose!
L311705	u6036	m402	BAILEY	Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
L311701	u6036	m402	BAILEY	All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
L311700	u6059	m402	POTTER	Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
L311699	u6036	m402	BAILEY	I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
L312240	u6051	m402	MAN	I'm hurrying.
L312239	u6037	m402	BERT	Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
L312238	u6051	m402	MAN	All right ?? all right.
L312237	u6037	m402	BERT	Get that ladder up here.
L312236	u6037	m402	BERT	The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
L312235	u6051	m402	MAN	Who?
L312234	u6037	m402	BERT	Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
L312232	u6051	m402	MAN	Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
L312231	u6037	m402	BERT	How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
L312230	u6051	m402	MAN	Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
L312722	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What did . . .
L312721	u6037	m402	BERT	Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
L312720	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Don't . . . George?
L312719	u6037	m402	BERT	What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
L312674	u6037	m402	BERT	I hate to do this, fella.
L312673	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there ?? he says he's an angel ?? he's tried to hypnotize me.
L312670	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
L312669	u6037	m402	BERT	Stand back.
L312668	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
L312667	u6037	m402	BERT	All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
L311767	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
L311766	u6037	m402	BERT	George . . .
L312368	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
L312367	u6038	m402	CARTER	Yeah, very funny.
L312366	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
L312365	u6038	m402	CARTER	Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
L312364	u6045	m402	GEORGE	We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
L312363	u6038	m402	CARTER	Merry Christmas.
L312362	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
L312361	u6038	m402	CARTER	Carter ?? bank examiner.
L312360	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Good morning, sir.
L312708	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Where is she?
L312707	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	She's . . .
L312704	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	I'm not supposed to tell.
L312703	u6045	m402	GEORGE	If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
L312702	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	I . . .
L312701	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I don't know how you know these things, but tell me ?? where is she?
L312700	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh, well, I can't . . .
L312699	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Where's Mary?
L312698	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Yes, George?
L312697	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Clarence . . .
L312694	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
L312693	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
L312692	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
L312691	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	You know where he lives?
L312642	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Zuzu's petals.
L312641	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What?
L312640	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
L312639	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
L312638	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	You're nobody. You have no identity.
L312637	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
L312636	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
L312635	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
L312634	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	No, of course not.
L312633	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
L312632	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
L312631	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
L312619	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Why? Don't they believe in angels?
L312618	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
L312617	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
L312616	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Made what?
L312615	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
L312613	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
L312612	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No wonder you jumped in the river.
L312611	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	No.
L312610	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
L312609	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	No.
L312608	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow ?? you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
L312607	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
L312606	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
L312597	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
L312596	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	It isn't me!
L312595	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
L312587	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
L312586	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	You have no car.
L312584	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
L312583	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
L312581	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Our clothes are dry.
L312580	u6045	m402	GEORGE	It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
L312578	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
L312577	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
L312575	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
L312574	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What did you say?
L312573	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
L312572	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I said I wish I'd never been born.
L312571	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	What'd you say?
L312569	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
L312568	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
L312567	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh, tut, tut, tut.
L312566	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
L312565	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
L312564	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
L312563	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	By letting me help you.
L312562	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
L312561	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
L312560	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
L312559	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
L312558	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	I told you ?? I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
L312557	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
L312556	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
L312555	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
L312553	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Angel, Second Class.
L312552	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
L312551	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
L312550	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, who are you, then?
L312549	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh, no.
L312548	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What are you, a mind reader or something?
L312547	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
L312540	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Suicide.
L312539	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Go through with what?
L312538	u6039	m402	CLARENCE	Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
L312537	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You what? To save me?
L312334	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Yes, but George . . .
L312333	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
L312318	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	No!
L312317	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
L311983	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Yes, but what happened to George?
L311982	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star ?? made second team All American.
L311981	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	I know. I know. He didn't go.
L311744	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Well, wait and see.
L311743	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
L311742	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Not a soul.
L311741	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
L311740	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	That's the kid.
L311739	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
L311738	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	George Bailey.
L311737	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Who is it?
L311736	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	I want you to take a good look at that face.
L311735	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	What did you stop it for?
L311640	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
L311639	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	A boy?
L311638	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	That's your problem, George Bailey.
L311637	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Hey, who's that?
L311636	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Oh, wonderful!
L311635	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
L311634	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Why, yes. This is amazing.
L311633	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
L311632	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Where? I don't see a thing.
L311631	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
L311630	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Well, naturally. Of course.
L311629	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
L311628	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Sit down? What are . . .
L311627	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Poor George . . . Sit down.
L311626	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
L311625	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
L311624	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
L311623	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	What's that book you've got there?
L311622	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission ?? I mean ?? might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir ?? and people are beginning to talk.
L311621	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
L311620	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
L311619	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
L311618	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	Splendid! Is he sick?
L311617	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
L311616	u6040	m402	CLARENCE'S VOICE	You sent for me, sir?
L312651	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I know that girl!
L312650	u6041	m402	COP	I know. I know.
L312649	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen ?? that's Violet Bick!
L312648	u6041	m402	COP	They went out of business years ago.
L312647	u6045	m402	GEORGE	The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
L312646	u6041	m402	COP	The Building and what?
L312645	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
L311979	u6042	m402	DR. CAMPBELL	You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
L311978	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
L311977	u6042	m402	DR. CAMPBELL	That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
L311976	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What's that?
L311955	u6042	m402	DR. CAMPBELL	It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
L311954	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Thank you very much.
L311947	u6042	m402	DR. CAMPBELL	Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting ?? to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
L311946	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Thanks.
L311945	u6042	m402	DR. CAMPBELL	I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
L312662	u6043	m402	ERNIE	Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
L312661	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Of course it's the place.
L312660	u6043	m402	ERNIE	Is this the place?
L312659	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
L312658	u6043	m402	ERNIE	Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
L312656	u6043	m402	ERNIE	All right.
L312655	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yeah ?? yeah ?? hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
L312654	u6043	m402	ERNIE	Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
L312653	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
L312142	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, look at this. Champagne!
L312141	u6043	m402	ERNIE	Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
L312140	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
L312139	u6043	m402	ERNIE	If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
L311765	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hi, Bert.
L311764	u6043	m402	ERNIE	Hiya, George!
L311763	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hey, Ernie!
L312344	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Yes, sir.
L312343	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	Joseph, now show him what happened today.
L312342	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
L311615	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	Yes, but he's got the faith of a child ?? simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
L311614	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
L311613	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	Oh ?? Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
L311612	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
L311611	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
L311610	u6049	m402	JOSEPH'S VOICE	Looks like we'll have to send someone down ?? a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
L311609	u6044	m402	FRANKLIN'S VOICE	Hello, Joseph, trouble?
L312689	u6050	m402	MA BAILEY	That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
L312688	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Today, over at the house.
L312687	u6050	m402	MA BAILEY	When'd you see him last?
L312686	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, sure I do.
L312685	u6050	m402	MA BAILEY	Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
L312684	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
L312682	u6050	m402	MA BAILEY	Mother? What do you want?
L312681	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mother . . .
L312680	u6050	m402	MA BAILEY	Well?
L312737	u6065	m402	ZUZU	Fine.
L312736	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Zuzu ?? Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
L312735	u6065	m402	ZUZU	Daddy!
L312474	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Uh-huh.
L312473	u6065	m402	ZUZU	It will?
L312472	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I know ?? I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
L312471	u6065	m402	ZUZU	I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
L312470	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Will you try to get some sleep?
L312469	u6065	m402	ZUZU	What?
L312467	u6065	m402	ZUZU	Give the flower a drink.
L312466	u6045	m402	GEORGE	There it is, good as new.
L312465	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
L312464	u6065	m402	ZUZU	Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
L312463	u6045	m402	GEORGE	All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
L312462	u6065	m402	ZUZU	Want to give my flower a drink.
L312461	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
L312460	u6065	m402	ZUZU	I won a flower.
L312459	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, what happened to you?
L312458	u6065	m402	ZUZU	Hi, Daddy.
L312280	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Goodbye, Sam.
L312279	u6060	m402	SAM	So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
L312274	u6060	m402	SAM	I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
L312273	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, now, don't rub it in.
L312272	u6060	m402	SAM	Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
L312271	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
L312268	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh . . .
L312267	u6060	m402	SAM	We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
L311852	u6060	m402	SAM	Hee-haw!
L311851	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hee-haw!
L311846	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yep.
L311845	u6060	m402	SAM	Yeah ?? old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
L311844	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Old college graduate now, huh?
L311843	u6060	m402	SAM	Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
L311842	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
L311753	u6048	m402	JOE	A cattle boat?
L311752	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'm working across on a cattle boat.
L311751	u6048	m402	JOE	What boat you sailing on?
L311749	u6045	m402	GEORGE	That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
L311748	u6048	m402	JOE	No charge.
L311747	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
L311746	u6048	m402	JOE	I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
L311745	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Big ?? see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
L312530	u6052	m402	MARTINI	Please don't go away ?? please!
L312529	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'm all right.
L312528	u6052	m402	MARTINI	Oh, no ?? you don't feel so good.
L312527	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'm all right.
L312526	u6052	m402	MARTINI	Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
L312523	u6052	m402	MARTINI	The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
L312522	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh ?? Welch. That's what I get for praying.
L312521	u6052	m402	MARTINI	He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
L312255	u6045	m402	GEORGE	All in . . .
L312254	u6052	m402	MARTINI	Goodbye, everybody!
L312249	u6052	m402	MARTINI	I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
L312248	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What's that?
L312050	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
L312049	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	Oh, George!
L312048	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
L312047	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	Uh-huh.
L312046	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mother, you know, I can see right through you ?? right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
L312045	u6045	m402	GEORGE	And all's fair in love and war?
L312044	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
L312043	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh . . .
L312042	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
L312041	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well then, how do you know?
L312040	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	No.
L312039	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
L312038	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	Well, she's not crazy about him.
L312037	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
L312036	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	Hmmm?
L312035	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Sure ?? Sam Wainwright.
L312034	u6056	m402	MRS. BAILEY	Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?

L311672	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, sir.
L311671	u6046	m402	GOWER	You're not paid to be a canary.
L311670	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yes, sir.
L311669	u6046	m402	GOWER	George! George!
L312625	u6057	m402	NICK	What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
L312624	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
L312623	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Look, Nick. What's wrong?
L312622	u6057	m402	NICK	That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
L312602	u6057	m402	NICK	Okay.  What's yours?
L312601	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Okay ?? all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
L312600	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
L312599	u6057	m402	NICK	You want a martini?
L312525	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
L312524	u6057	m402	NICK	Yes, you bet.
L311838	u6058	m402	POP	Have a good time, son.
L311837	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
L311835	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
L311834	u6058	m402	POP	This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
L311833	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
L311832	u6058	m402	POP	Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
L311831	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
L311830	u6058	m402	POP	I know it's soon to talk about it.
L311825	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
L311824	u6058	m402	POP	Still after that first million before you're thirty.
L311823	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about ?? build things . . . design new buildings ?? plan modern cities ?? all that stuff I was talking about.
L311822	u6058	m402	POP	I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
L311821	u6045	m402	GEORGE	How's that?
L311820	u6058	m402	POP	Maybe you were born older, George.
L311819	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, no younger than I was.
L311818	u6058	m402	POP	He's pretty young for that job.
L311817	u6045	m402	GEORGE	We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
L311816	u6058	m402	POP	Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
L311815	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
L311801	u6058	m402	POP	Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
L311800	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
L311799	u6058	m402	POP	I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
L311798	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh . . .
L311797	u6058	m402	POP	Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
L311796	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
L311795	u6058	m402	POP	Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
L312763	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Harry . . . Harry . . .
L312762	u6047	m402	HARRY	Hello, George, how are you?
L311994	u6047	m402	HARRY	Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
L311993	u6045	m402	GEORGE	She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
L311992	u6047	m402	HARRY	Say, where's Mother?
L311991	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, am I glad to see you.
L311942	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Did you get a doctor?
L311941	u6047	m402	HARRY	Come on, George, let's hurry.
L311940	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
L311810	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I hope it works.
L311809	u6047	m402	HARRY	Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
L311808	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What do you mean, and be bored to death?
L311805	u6047	m402	HARRY	Very funny. Very funny.
L311804	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Got a match?
L311868	u6053	m402	MARTY	Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
L311867	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
L311864	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, yeah, yeah.
L311863	u6053	m402	MARTY	Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
L311862	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What's that?
L311861	u6053	m402	MARTY	Do me a favor, will you, George?
L311860	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
L311859	u6053	m402	MARTY	George.
L312758	u6064	m402	VIOLET	I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
L312757	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Violet Bick!
L312403	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Now, let's hear from you . . .
L312402	u6064	m402	VIOLET	Yeah ?? yeah . . . sure I will.
L312401	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Say hello to New York for me.
L312398	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
L312397	u6064	m402	VIOLET	I know, but . . .
L312396	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
L312395	u6064	m402	VIOLET	No, George, don't . . .
L312390	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
L312389	u6064	m402	VIOLET	George, can I see you for a second?
L312065	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
L312064	u6064	m402	VIOLET	Huh?
L312063	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
L312059	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
L312058	u6064	m402	VIOLET	Where are you going?
L312057	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Nothing.
L312056	u6064	m402	VIOLET	What gives?
L312055	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hello, Vi.
L312054	u6064	m402	VIOLET	Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
L311858	u6064	m402	VIOLET	Hello, what am I bid?
L311857	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hello, Violet.
L311856	u6064	m402	VIOLET	Hey, George . . .
L311770	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
L311769	u6064	m402	VIOLET	Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
L311655	u6064	m402	VIOLET	She was here first.
L311654	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Two cents worth of shoelaces?
L312419	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
L312418	u6045	m402	GEORGE	And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
L312417	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	This way.
L312416	u6045	m402	GEORGE	All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
L312415	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
L312414	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Now look, did you buy anything?
L312222	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	We'll save them for seed. A toast!
L312221	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
L312220	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Those Rockefellers!
L312180	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
L312179	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
L312174	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hello?
L312173	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
L312172	u6045	m402	GEORGE	The whole town's gone crazy.
L312171	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
L312170	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Holy mackerel!
L312169	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
L312168	u6045	m402	GEORGE	All of it?
L312167	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
L312166	u6045	m402	GEORGE	When?
L312165	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
L312164	u6045	m402	GEORGE	All right now, what happened? How did it start?
L312163	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
L312162	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Why didn't you call me?
L312159	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	George . . .
L312158	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
L312018	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	That way, huh?
L312017	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
L312016	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
L312015	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Right down here.
L312014	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look ?? if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
L312002	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
L312001	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Well, what do you know ?? wife.
L311996	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	How do you do.
L311995	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hello.
L311988	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Peanut?
L311987	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
L311986	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
L311693	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
L311692	u6045	m402	GEORGE	It's important.
L311691	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Some other time, George.
L311690	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
L311689	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
L312510	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Five hundred dollars.
L312509	u6059	m402	POTTER	Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
L312507	u6059	m402	POTTER	I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
L312506	u6045	m402	GEORGE	They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
L312505	u6059	m402	POTTER	Well, what about all your other friends?
L312504	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
L312503	u6059	m402	POTTER	Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
L312502	u6059	m402	POTTER	What is it ?? a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
L312501	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
L312500	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
L312499	u6059	m402	POTTER	Have you notified the police?
L312498	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yes, sir.
L312300	u6045	m402	GEORGE	All right, sir.
L312299	u6059	m402	POTTER	In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
L312298	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'd like to do that.
L312297	u6059	m402	POTTER	Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
L312296	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
L312295	u6059	m402	POTTER	Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
L312294	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, what about the Building and Loan?
L312293	u6059	m402	POTTER	Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in ?? providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
L312292	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
L312291	u6059	m402	POTTER	You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
L312287	u6059	m402	POTTER	The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
L312286	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
L312285	u6059	m402	POTTER	You like it? I'll send you a box.
L312284	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
L311963	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
L311962	u6059	m402	POTTER	I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
L311961	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Just a minute ?? just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
L311960	u6059	m402	POTTER	You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
L311959	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yes, sir.
L311709	u6059	m402	POTTER	They're not my children.
L311708	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Pop!
L311704	u6059	m402	POTTER	Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
L311703	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Pop!
L312132	u6061	m402	SAM'S VOICE	Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
L312131	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
L312130	u6061	m402	SAM'S VOICE	That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
L312129	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
L312128	u6061	m402	SAM'S VOICE	Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
L312127	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
L312126	u6061	m402	SAM'S VOICE	Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
L312125	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
L312124	u6061	m402	SAM'S VOICE	I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
L312746	u6054	m402	MARY	You have no idea what happened . . .
L312745	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You have no idea what's happened to me.
L312744	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, George, George!
L312743	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
L312742	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, George, George, George.
L312741	u6054	m402	MARY	George, darling! Where have you been?
L312740	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mary! Mary!
L312455	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Going up to see Zuzu.
L312454	u6054	m402	MARY	Where're you going?
L312451	u6054	m402	MARY	Just a teensie one ?? ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
L312450	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Is she running a temperature? What is it?
L312449	u6054	m402	MARY	Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
L312448	u6045	m402	GEORGE	The doctor? Was the doctor here?
L312447	u6054	m402	MARY	Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
L312446	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What is it, a sore throat or what?
L312445	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
L312444	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
L312431	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Left them at the office.
L312430	u6054	m402	MARY	Where's your coat and hat?
L312429	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Yeah, just started.
L312428	u6054	m402	MARY	Is it snowing?
L312314	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
L312313	u6054	m402	MARY	George Bailey lassos stork.
L312312	u6054	m402	MARY	My baby.
L312311	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
L312310	u6054	m402	MARY	I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
L312309	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
L312308	u6054	m402	MARY	To keep from being an old maid.
L312307	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
L312306	u6054	m402	MARY	Hi.
L312305	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hi.
L312282	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Thanks for dropping around.
L312281	u6054	m402	MARY	Have fun.
L312245	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Darling, you're wonderful.
L312244	u6054	m402	MARY	Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
L312243	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, Mary . . .
L312156	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
L312155	u6054	m402	MARY	Please, let's not stop, George.
L312154	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
L312150	u6045	m402	GEORGE	That does it ?? come here.
L312149	u6054	m402	MARY	After that, who cares?
L312147	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels ?? the oldest champagne ?? the richest caviar ?? the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
L312146	u6054	m402	MARY	I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
L312145	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
L312135	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Mary . . .
L312134	u6054	m402	MARY	George . . . George . . . George . . .
L312100	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
L312099	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
L312098	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
L312097	u6054	m402	MARY	Don't you like her?
L312096	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
L312094	u6054	m402	MARY	Thank you.
L312093	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
L312092	u6054	m402	MARY	Well, then, sit down.
L312091	u6045	m402	GEORGE	No, I don't want to be rude.
L312090	u6054	m402	MARY	Would you rather leave?
L312089	u6045	m402	GEORGE	All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
L312087	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
L312086	u6045	m402	GEORGE	It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
L312085	u6054	m402	MARY	Do you like it?
L312084	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Where'd you get that dress?
L312083	u6054	m402	MARY	Tuesday.
L312082	u6045	m402	GEORGE	When did you get back?
L312081	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
L312080	u6054	m402	MARY	Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
L312077	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
L312076	u6054	m402	MARY	Didn't you tell her?
L312075	u6045	m402	GEORGE	My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
L312074	u6054	m402	MARY	About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
L312073	u6045	m402	GEORGE	About what?
L312072	u6054	m402	MARY	Have you made up your mind?
L312071	u6045	m402	GEORGE	How's that?
L312070	u6054	m402	MARY	Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
L312069	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
L311938	u6054	m402	MARY	I'm going to scream!
L311937	u6045	m402	GEORGE	They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
L311934	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
L311933	u6054	m402	MARY	Ouch!
L311922	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
L311921	u6054	m402	MARY	I'll take it. And then what?
L311920	u6045	m402	GEORGE	What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
L311919	u6054	m402	MARY	If I told you it might not come true.
L311918	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Come on, tell me.
L311917	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, no.
L311915	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
L311914	u6054	m402	MARY	What'd you wish, George?
L311913	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
L311912	u6054	m402	MARY	Uh-huh.
L311911	u6045	m402	GEORGE	In that place?
L311910	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
L311908	u6054	m402	MARY	Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
L311907	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
L311906	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Ummmmm . . .
L311905	u6054	m402	MARY	You may kiss my hand.
L311904	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
L311900	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
L311899	u6054	m402	MARY	Too young or too old?
L311898	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
L311897	u6054	m402	MARY	Eighteen.
L311896	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
L311895	u6054	m402	MARY	Well, why don't you say it?
L311894	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
L311893	u6054	m402	MARY	Do I look as funny as you do?
L311891	u6054	m402	MARY	Beautiful.
L311890	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Hot dog! Just like an organ.
L311886	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Okay ?? what can we lose?
L311885	u6054	m402	MARY	Neither am I.
L311884	u6045	m402	GEORGE	I'm not very good at this.
L311882	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
L311881	u6054	m402	MARY	Uh-huh.
L311880	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Me?
L311879	u6054	m402	MARY	You've passed me on the street almost every day.
L311878	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, I don't.
L311877	u6054	m402	MARY	Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
L311876	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Well, hello.
L311666	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
L311665	u6054	m402	MARY	A new magazine! I never saw it before.
L311664	u6045	m402	GEORGE	You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here ?? from Tahiti ?? Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
L311663	u6054	m402	MARY	I don't like coconuts.
L311662	u6045	m402	GEORGE	With coconuts?
L311661	u6054	m402	MARY	I'll take chocolate.
L311660	u6045	m402	GEORGE	Made up your mind yet?
L311807	u6047	m402	HARRY	Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
L311806	u6055	m402	MOTHER	Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
L311793	u6055	m402	MOTHER	Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
L311792	u6047	m402	HARRY	Oh, Mom ?? I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
L311791	u6055	m402	MOTHER	What plates?
L311790	u6047	m402	HARRY	Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
L311785	u6047	m402	HARRY	I don't care. It's George's tux.
L311784	u6055	m402	MOTHER	Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
L311783	u6047	m402	HARRY	I've eaten.
L311782	u6055	m402	MOTHER	Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
L312386	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Hmm? Well, I . . .
L312385	u6062	m402	TELLER	How about that one there?
L312384	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Oh, shucks . . .
L312383	u6062	m402	TELLER	Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
L312382	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Sure, sure I am.
L312381	u6062	m402	TELLER	Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
L312380	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	What?
L312379	u6062	m402	TELLER	You forgot something.
L312378	u6063	m402	UNCLE BILLY	Huh?
L312377	u6062	m402	TELLER	I guess you forgot something.
L332224	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
L332223	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
L332222	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
L332221	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
L332003	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Where did the vehicles stop?
L332002	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Phones are out too.
L331990	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The monitors are failing.
L331989	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
L331988	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
L331987	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What now?
L331986	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
L331975	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
L331974	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The door security systems are shutting down.
L331973	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	What?
L331964	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
L331963	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
L331962	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
L331957	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
L331956	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
L331917	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Damn!
L331916	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
L331912	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	It's not worth taking the chance, John.
L331911	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You're sure we have to?
L331910	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
L331879	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Stop the program!  Stop the program!
L331878	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
L332242	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	'Bout thirty seconds.
L332241	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How long will this take?
L332232	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
L332231	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How would we cut off the lysine?
L332230	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
L332226	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
L332225	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But would we get the phones back?
L332220	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
L332219	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
L332077	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
L332076	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	Uh - - about two million.
L332075	u6163	m411	ELLIE	How many lines of code are there?
L332074	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What one?
L332073	u6161	m411	ARNOLD	I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
L332072	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
L331626	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
L331625	u6162	m411	DODGSON	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
L331624	u6171	m411	NEDRY	That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
L331623	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
L331622	u6171	m411	NEDRY	What?  No menthol?
L331620	u6171	m411	NEDRY	How am I supposed to transport them?
L331619	u6162	m411	DODGSON	Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
L331618	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Oh, I'll get 'em all.
L331616	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
L331615	u6162	m411	DODGSON	You shouldn't use my name.
L331950	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
L331949	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
L331887	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
L331886	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
L331883	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
L331882	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
L331781	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
L331780	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
L331676	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Shhhhh!
L331675	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
L331952	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
L331951	u6167	m411	HARDING	Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
L331907	u6167	m411	HARDING	You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
L331906	u6163	m411	ELLIE	There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
L331905	u6167	m411	HARDING	Pretty sure.
L331904	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Are you sure?
L331903	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
L331902	u6163	m411	ELLIE	That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
L331901	u6167	m411	HARDING	They are?  I'll be damned.
L331900	u6163	m411	ELLIE	These are dilated.  Take a look.
L331899	u6167	m411	HARDING	Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
L331898	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Six weeks?
L331897	u6167	m411	HARDING	Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
L332312	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
L332311	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
L332310	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
L332286	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Look.
L332285	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
L332284	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why?
L332283	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But you know, I should  really be the one going .
L332274	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John....
L332273	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
L332192	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
L332191	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Once we have control again we - -
L332190	u6163	m411	ELLIE	John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
L332188	u6163	m411	ELLIE	But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
L332187	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
L332186	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	"A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  ""I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... "
L332185	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Carousel.
L332184	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
L332183	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
L331747	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
L331746	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
L331744	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
L331743	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.
L331742	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Fascinating animals, fascinating.
L331714	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Could I have a tissue please?
L331713	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.
L331712	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	There you are.  Out you come.
L331598	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
L331597	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I have samples all over the kitchen. 
L331596	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
L331595	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Did I say jerk?
L332361	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
L332360	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
L332359	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You can't hold it by yourself!
L332358	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
L332351	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
L332350	u6165	m411	GRANT	It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
L331954	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
L331953	u6165	m411	GRANT	Are you sure?
L331948	u6163	m411	ELLIE	And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
L331947	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - and swallows fresh ones.
L331946	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - barfs them up - -
L331945	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
L331944	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
L331943	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - a gizzard - -
L331942	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
L331941	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - like birds - -
L331938	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
L331937	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
L331936	u6165	m411	GRANT	Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
L331931	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yeah, I know.
L331930	u6165	m411	GRANT	Not just every six weeks.
L331929	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Constantly sick.
L331926	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I know.
L331925	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
L331894	u6163	m411	ELLIE	It's my favorite.
L331893	u6165	m411	GRANT	Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
L331831	u6165	m411	GRANT	Dilophosaurus.
L331830	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, shit.
L331691	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
L331690	u6165	m411	GRANT	Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
L331670	u6165	m411	GRANT	We're out of a job.
L331669	u6163	m411	ELLIE	So what are you thinking?
L331665	u6165	m411	GRANT	How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
L331664	u6163	m411	ELLIE	We were right!
L331663	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
L331659	u6165	m411	GRANT	Say again?
L331658	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
L331653	u6163	m411	ELLIE	They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
L331652	u6165	m411	GRANT	Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
L331651	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The - - agility.  You're right!
L331650	u6165	m411	GRANT	The movement!
L331607	u6165	m411	GRANT	What kind of park is it?
L331606	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why would they care what we think?
L331600	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Small versions of adults, honey.
L331599	u6165	m411	GRANT	And what are those?
L331594	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Sattler.
L331593	u6165	m411	GRANT	Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
L331592	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, who's the jerk?
L331582	u6163	m411	ELLIE	It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
L331581	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
L331580	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anything else, you old fossil?
L331579	u6165	m411	GRANT	The Cretaceous.
L331578	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The what?
L331577	u6165	m411	GRANT	They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
L331576	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
L331575	u6165	m411	GRANT	They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
L331574	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
L331573	u6165	m411	GRANT	They smell.
L331572	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Cheap, cheap, cheap.
L331571	u6165	m411	GRANT	Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
L331570	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
L331569	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
L331568	u6163	m411	ELLIE	You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
L331560	u6165	m411	GRANT	Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
L331559	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
L331543	u6165	m411	GRANT	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
L331542	u6163	m411	ELLIE	A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
L331541	u6163	m411	ELLIE	If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
L331540	u6165	m411	GRANT	The taphonomy sure looks that way.
L331539	u6163	m411	ELLIE	They died together?
L331538	u6165	m411	GRANT	Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
L332305	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Like hell it is!
L332304	u6170	m411	MULDOON	It's all right.
L332303	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
L332302	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Why not?
L332301	u6170	m411	MULDOON	No. We can't.
L332300	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
L332299	u6170	m411	MULDOON	C'mon on, this way.
L332298	u6170	m411	MULDOON	The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
L332297	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh my God.  Aw, God.
L332296	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Stick to my heels.
L332295	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay, I'm on channel two.
L332288	u6163	m411	ELLIE	We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
L332287	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Come on, let's go.
L332280	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Okay.
L332279	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I'm going with you.
L332277	u6170	m411	MULDOON	You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
L332276	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
L332228	u6163	m411	ELLIE	What's that?
L332227	u6170	m411	MULDOON	What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
L332136	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They're not here.
L332135	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?!
L332134	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I don't know.
L332133	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Do you see anything?
L332132	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan!
L332131	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Dr. Grant!
L332130	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The other car!
L332129	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Ellie, com one!!
L332128	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No, no, no!
L331758	u6170	m411	MULDOON	That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
L331757	u6163	m411	ELLIE	The fences are electrified, right?
L331756	u6170	m411	MULDOON	They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
L332248	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
L332247	u6163	m411	ELLIE	- - shut up.
L332246	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Yes?
L332238	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
L332237	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
L332148	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
L332147	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
L332146	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
L332145	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Faster, faster!
L332124	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Please - - chance it.
L332123	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Can we chance moving him?
L331909	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Yeah.
L331908	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dino droppings?
L331874	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331873	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
L331872	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan?
L331871	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
L331870	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Unpredictability....
L331869	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
L331868	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Oh, imperfections?
L331867	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
L331866	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Alan, listen to this.
L331865	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
L331864	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
L331862	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
L331861	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I'm still not clear on Chaos.
L331860	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
L331851	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
L331850	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
L331735	u6163	m411	ELLIE	Anti-nature.
L331734	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	It's anti-nature.
L331733	u6163	m411	ELLIE	When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
L331732	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	And scary.
L331731	u6163	m411	ELLIE	And scary.
L331730	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I know, it's very exciting.
L331729	u6163	m411	ELLIE	I get ah - -
L331728	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	That's right.  Will break through.
L331639	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
L331638	u6163	m411	ELLIE	No.
L331536	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
L331535	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Why not?
L331534	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
L331533	u6164	m411	GENNARO	If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
L331530	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
L331529	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
L331528	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
L331527	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
L331526	u6164	m411	GENNARO	You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
L331525	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	He sends his apologies.
L331524	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What's this I hear at the airport? Hammond's not even here?
L331523	u6172	m411	ROSTAGNO	Hola, bienvenido
L331522	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hola, Juanito
L332023	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
L332022	u6173	m411	TIM	Yeah.
L332021	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Are they heavy?
L332020	u6173	m411	TIM	In a box under my seat.
L332019	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where did you find those things?
L332015	u6173	m411	TIM	People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
L332014	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
L332013	u6173	m411	TIM	Up and down, up and down!
L331829	u6173	m411	TIM	Dilophosaurus.
L331828	u6164	m411	GENNARO	What are we looking for?
L331827	u6173	m411	TIM	I can't see.
L331799	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
L331798	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Hey!  Where are the brakes?
L331797	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
L331785	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Thank you.
L331784	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
L331766	u6164	m411	GENNARO	I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
L331765	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
L331764	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
L331763	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
L331762	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
L331761	u6164	m411	GENNARO	And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
L331701	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
L331700	u6164	m411	GENNARO	John, we - - what I'm just saying....
L331689	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
L331688	u6164	m411	GENNARO	This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
L331645	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
L331644	u6164	m411	GENNARO	Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
L331643	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
L331642	u6164	m411	GENNARO	The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
L332330	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
L332329	u6173	m411	TIM	Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
L332325	u6165	m411	GRANT	Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!

L331789	u6165	m411	GRANT	"What does he mean by ""target audience""?"
L331788	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.

L331694	u6165	m411	GRANT	Can't you stop these things?!
L331657	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
L331656	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
L331655	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	The brachiosaur?  Thirty.

L331611	u6165	m411	GRANT	- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
L331610	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
L331609	u6165	m411	GRANT	No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
L331608	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
L331605	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
L331604	u6165	m411	GRANT	What kind of opinions?
L331603	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
L331602	u6165	m411	GRANT	I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -

L332218	u6165	m411	GRANT	Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!

L332255	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"Wait a minute?  What do you mean ""worked""?  Everything is still off!"
L332254	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
L332244	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	"You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have ""thinktelligence.""  You think narrowly and call it ""being focused.""  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions."
L332243	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
L331779	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
L331778	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
L331777	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
L331776	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
L331775	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
L331774	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
L331772	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
L331771	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
L331723	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
L331722	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Your silence intrigues me.
L331637	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
L331636	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Don't do that!
L331635	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John, John.
L331634	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
L331633	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
L331632	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
L331631	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
L331630	u6169	m411	MALCOLM	Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
L331629	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
L331844	u6171	m411	NEDRY	Thanks, Dad.
L331843	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
L331842	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
L331841	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
L331840	u6171	m411	NEDRY	You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
L331839	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
L331838	u6171	m411	NEDRY	I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
L332079	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Sure.
L332078	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
L332070	u6170	m411	MULDOON	There's no sign of him anywhere.
L332069	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Well?
L331915	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Thanks, Steve.

L331913	u6170	m411	MULDOON	Sustain winds 45 knots.
L331820	u6166	m411	HAMMOND	Ray, start the tour program.
L331819	u6170	m411	MULDOON	I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

L354936	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hello, L.A.
L354933	u6367	m424	HARRY	Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
L354932	u6360	m424	BELLBOY	Thirty-five bucks.
L354931	u6367	m424	HARRY	How much?
L354930	u6360	m424	BELLBOY	You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
L354929	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah?
L354923	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah.  It's French.
L354922	u6360	m424	BELLBOY	Mister D'Amour?
L355369	u6361	m424	BILLY	Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
L355368	u6367	m424	HARRY	Thanks, Billy.
L355365	u6361	m424	BILLY	I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
L355364	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hokey enough for you?
L355359	u6361	m424	BILLY	Knew what?
L355358	u6367	m424	HARRY	That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
L355357	u6361	m424	BILLY	Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
L355356	u6367	m424	HARRY	What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
L355355	u6361	m424	BILLY	I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
L355354	u6367	m424	HARRY	Maybe they're not tricks.
L355352	u6367	m424	HARRY	A Nix specialty?
L355351	u6361	m424	BILLY	Take a look at this.
L355349	u6361	m424	BILLY	doorway) And who's that?
L355348	u6367	m424	HARRY	That's Butterfield...
L355345	u6367	m424	HARRY	That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
L355344	u6361	m424	BILLY	I could have lost my fucking hands.
L355339	u6361	m424	BILLY	Nope.
L355338	u6367	m424	HARRY	Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
L355337	u6361	m424	BILLY	I love weird.
L355336	u6367	m424	HARRY	My life was too weird for her.
L355335	u6361	m424	BILLY	Why?
L355334	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
L355333	u6361	m424	BILLY	You ever been married?
L355332	u6367	m424	HARRY	You heard right.
L355331	u6361	m424	BILLY	I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
L355328	u6361	m424	BILLY	It'll be something hokey.
L355327	u6367	m424	HARRY	How?
L355326	u6361	m424	BILLY	I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
L355230	u6361	m424	BILLY	I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
L355229	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is he?
L355228	u6361	m424	BILLY	Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
L355227	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix?
L355226	u6361	m424	BILLY	Nix.
L355225	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who?
L355224	u6361	m424	BILLY	I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
L355223	u6367	m424	HARRY	They go together.
L355222	u6361	m424	BILLY	I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
L354927	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	That's so cool.
L354926	u6367	m424	HARRY	Right.
L354921	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	Isn't that French for something?
L354920	u6367	m424	HARRY	Right.
L354919	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	D'Amour.
L354918	u6367	m424	HARRY	D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
L354917	u6362	m424	BLONDE GIRL	How'd you spell that again?
L355147	u6367	m424	HARRY	All right.  It was...
L355146	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Who did this?
L355145	u6367	m424	HARRY	I told you --
L355144	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Who did this?
L355143	u6367	m424	HARRY	Deep shit?
L355142	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
L355141	u6367	m424	HARRY	Beats me.
L355140	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Why would I do that?
L355139	u6367	m424	HARRY	You did.  Didn't you?
L354998	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	It's an illusion.
L354997	u6370	m424	MILLER	What about death?
L354996	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Death.
L354995	u6370	m424	MILLER	About?
L354994	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
L354993	u6370	m424	MILLER	"What do you mean, ""all of us?"""
L354992	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
L354991	u6370	m424	MILLER	He won't.
L354990	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	I don't want him getting in the way.
L354989	u6370	m424	MILLER	No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
L354988	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	He's a priest?
L354987	u6370	m424	MILLER	I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
L354986	u6370	m424	MILLER	I know him.  I saw him.
L354985	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
L355547	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	It's him... it's him.
L355546	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
L355539	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
L355538	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	If you've lied to me to me --
L355537	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Not yet.
L355536	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Anything?
L355467	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	You'll do more.than that.
L355466	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'll tell you.
L355464	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I don't know.
L355463	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	So tell me where Nix is buried.
L355462	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Don't.
L355461	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	I could scoop them out.
L355460	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Please.
L355534	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Maybe he'll show you.
L355533	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What is he?
L355532	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
L355531	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
L355530	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
L355529	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Why did you wait so long?
L355528	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
L355504	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	It was me.
L355503	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
L355585	u6364	m424	CULTISTS	He's with us... He's with us...
L355584	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	He's with us...
L355577	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Be ready.
L355576	u6364	m424	CULTISTS	Yes...
L355575	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Will you come to him on your knees?
L355574	u6364	m424	CULTISTS	Yes...
L355573	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Do you wish him to be amongst us?
L355234	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
L355233	u6372	m424	QUAID	Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
L354956	u6372	m424	QUAID	Yes.
L354955	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	And are you afraid?
L354954	u6372	m424	QUAID	Yes.
L354953	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
L354952	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
L354951	u6372	m424	QUAID	Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
L354950	u6363	m424	BUTTERFIELD	Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
L355695	u6367	m424	HARRY	Out!  Out!
L355694	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry-?
L355693	u6367	m424	HARRY	What the fuck?
L355691	u6367	m424	HARRY	I think so.
L355690	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Is it finished?
L355675	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm okay.  I'm okay.
L355674	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry?
L355670	u6367	m424	HARRY	I... have... to.
L355669	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Don't look.
L355667	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.
L355666	u6367	m424	HARRY	...yes?
L355665	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I'm here, Harry.
L355664	u6367	m424	HARRY	... oh... God...
L355661	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry...
L355660	u6367	m424	HARRY	No!  No!  No!
L355636	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
L355635	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You can't.
L355634	u6367	m424	HARRY	I've got to help him.
L355623	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hang on!
L355622	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh God!
L355435	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's all right.  It's not hurting...
L355434	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry?
L355430	u6367	m424	HARRY	Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
L355429	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Are you all right?
L355418	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's okay.
L355417	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What was that?
L355416	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
L355415	u6367	m424	HARRY	Quaid and Jennifer--
L355414	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.
L355413	u6367	m424	HARRY	And they all came...
L355412	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
L355411	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
L355410	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm sure.  He's dead.
L355409	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Are you sure?
L355408	u6367	m424	HARRY	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
L355407	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was so afraid.
L355406	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nothing you don't want.
L355405	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Nothing?
L355404	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nothing's going to happen to you.
L355403	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm here, aren't I?
L355402	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
L355401	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's okay.
L355399	u6367	m424	HARRY	He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
L355398	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
L355397	u6367	m424	HARRY	What then?
L355396	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I wasn't.
L355395	u6367	m424	HARRY	You said you weren't with him for love.
L355394	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No.
L355393	u6367	m424	HARRY	Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
L355392	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I told you --
L355391	u6367	m424	HARRY	So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
L355390	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Some or it.
L355389	u6367	m424	HARRY	He taught all this to Swann?
L355388	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
L355387	u6367	m424	HARRY	Stuff?
L355386	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
L355385	u6367	m424	HARRY	He was the real thing, right?
L355384	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	It was more than that, I think.
L355383	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
L355382	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why don't you tell me the truth?
L355381	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh Christ.
L355380	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
L355379	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What did you find?
L355378	u6367	m424	HARRY	I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
L355377	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
L355253	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  You do that.
L355252	u6367	m424	HARRY	Okay.  I'll keep digging.
L355251	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
L355250	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Jennifer Desiderio?
L355249	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
L355248	u6367	m424	HARRY	Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
L355247	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	That's my business. Harry.
L355246	u6367	m424	HARRY	So why did you marry him?
L355245	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't marry him for love.
L355244	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He... didn't have me..  I told you-
L355243	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why?  Because he had you?
L355242	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	They were jealous of him.
L355241	u6367	m424	HARRY	I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
L355240	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	How did it go today?
L355165	u6367	m424	HARRY	Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
L355164	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
L355163	u6367	m424	HARRY	I can be very persuasive.
L355162	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	They won't tell you anything.
L355161	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
L355160	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I don't know where you'd start.
L355159	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
L355158	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
L355157	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are they treating you okay?
L355120	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You haven't seen anything yet.
L355119	u6367	m424	HARRY	He's good.
L355090	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sure.
L355089	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
L355088	u6367	m424	HARRY	Do you?
L355087	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
L355086	u6367	m424	HARRY	When do you want me to start?
L355085	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
L355084	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm no bodyguard.
L355083	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harry.
L355082	u6367	m424	HARRY	Harry.
L355081	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
L355080	u6367	m424	HARRY	Where do I sign?
L355079	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
L355078	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sorry.  You asked.
L355077	u6367	m424	HARRY	He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
L355076	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You don't believe me.
L355075	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
L355074	u6367	m424	HARRY	But obviously you still care what happens to him.
L355073	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
L355072	u6367	m424	HARRY	Does that mean...?
L355071	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
L355070	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you don't ask questions?
L355069	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	He's a secretive man.
L355068	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why not?
L355067	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
L355066	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's the connection?
L355065	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I think we make our own futures.
L355064	u6367	m424	HARRY	You don't?
L355063	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
L355062	u6367	m424	HARRY	Did your husband know Quaid?
L355061	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
L355451	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
L355450	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	What about me?
L355321	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I left three messages already.
L355320	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
L355319	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
L355318	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	No word from D'Amour?
L355317	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
L355021	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	You saw this?
L355020	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Good.  There.  Yes?
L355019	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Valentin?
L355017	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.  I'm not going near him.
L355016	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
L355015	u6373	m424	SWANN	I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
L355014	u6373	m424	SWANN	I just saw him.
L355013	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Oh God.
L355012	u6373	m424	SWANN	Somebody killed him.
L355011	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Sure.
L355010	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
L355009	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	... they believe you.
L355008	u6373	m424	SWANN	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
L355007	u6365	m424	DOROTHEA	Bad show last night?
L355156	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.  Not yet...
L355155	u6366	m424	EDDISON	For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
L355154	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you finished with me?
L355153	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Another fucking magician. Jesus.
L355152	u6367	m424	HARRY	--vanished.
L355151	u6366	m424	EDDISON	And this Butterfield guy--
L354983	u6366	m424	EDDISON	After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
L354982	u6367	m424	HARRY	He got up and walked.
L354981	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Where the fuck is he?
L354980	u6366	m424	EDDISON	New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
L354979	u6367	m424	HARRY	I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
L354978	u6366	m424	EDDISON	What makes you so sure?
L354977	u6367	m424	HARRY	Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
L354976	u6366	m424	EDDISON	Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
L354975	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
L354974	u6366	m424	EDDISON	What were you doing up there?
L355220	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Fuck you.
L355219	u6367	m424	HARRY	Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
L355217	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
L355216	u6367	m424	HARRY	With what?
L355215	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
L355214	u6367	m424	HARRY	Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
L355213	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
L355212	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'd like to hear them.
L355211	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Oh, I've got plenty.
L355210	u6367	m424	HARRY	You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
L355209	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	If he was so good why's he so dead?
L355208	u6367	m424	HARRY	I heard he was the best.
L355207	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	They weren't worth a damn.
L355206	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Swann's miracles?
L355205	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
L355204	u6367	m424	HARRY	So could you walk on water?
L355203	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
L355202	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
L355201	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	Trickery and divinity.
L355200	u6367	m424	HARRY	Heaven and Hell?
L355199	u6376	m424	VINOVICH	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
L355198	u6367	m424	HARRY	You believe that?
L355566	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
L355565	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about?
L355564	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm sorry, D'Amour...
L355563	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
L355562	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Don't bother.
L355561	u6367	m424	HARRY	We've got to get you to a hospital.
L355560	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Him too.
L355554	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Help me.
L355553	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shit...
L355552	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	D'Amour --
L355449	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
L355448	u6367	m424	HARRY	I want to see Swann face to face.
L355447	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
L355446	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
L355445	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
L355444	u6367	m424	HARRY	Was that Swann's idea?
L355443	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I tried to pay you off.
L355442	u6367	m424	HARRY	And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
L355441	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.
L355440	u6367	m424	HARRY	You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
L355439	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.
L355438	u6367	m424	HARRY	You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
L355433	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355432	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you satisfied now?
L355375	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shut up!
L355374	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Leave her alone --
L355372	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You want more money, is that it?
L355371	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah, I know.
L355370	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I can't let you in.
L355315	u6367	m424	HARRY	When will she be in?
L355314	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm afraid she's not in.
L355313	u6367	m424	HARRY	I want to speak to Dorothea.
L355271	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355270	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
L355269	u6367	m424	HARRY	I like to know why things happen.
L355268	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	What for?  You need to stay busy?
L355267	u6367	m424	HARRY	Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
L355266	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Yes.  It's regrettable
L355265	u6367	m424	HARRY	Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
L355264	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
L355263	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
L355262	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	A ticket home,
L355261	u6367	m424	HARRY	What for?
L355260	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
L355259	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why'd you come here?
L355258	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
L355257	u6367	m424	HARRY	What the fuck are you doing here?
L355060	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Swann's wife.
L355059	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is she?
L355057	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you a believer, then?
L355056	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are you sure?
L355055	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I don't think the dead much care.
L355054	u6367	m424	HARRY	It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
L355053	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Probably.
L355052	u6367	m424	HARRY	Any movie stars buried here?
L355051	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
L355050	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's the difference?
L355049	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
L355048	u6367	m424	HARRY	When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
L355047	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Are you a gambling man?
L355046	u6367	m424	HARRY	I saw him in Vegas once.
L355045	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You know of him?
L355044	u6367	m424	HARRY	Philip Swann?
L355043	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
L355042	u6367	m424	HARRY	Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
L355041	u6367	m424	HARRY	Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
L355040	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Maybe I just bought it.
L355039	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
L355038	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Mine.
L355037	u6367	m424	HARRY	Whose is the car?
L355035	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
L355034	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
L355033	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I'm here to offer you a job.
L355032	u6367	m424	HARRY	Then what do you want?
L355031	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	We've never met.
L355030	u6367	m424	HARRY	Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
L355029	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
L355028	u6367	m424	HARRY	What are you, my mother?
L355027	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	It's one in the afternoon.
L355026	u6367	m424	HARRY	Go away.
L355025	u6375	m424	VALENTIN	Mr. D'Amour?
L355024	u6367	m424	HARRY	Shit.
L355283	u6367	m424	HARRY	And what does Jennifer think's real?
L355282	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
L355281	u6367	m424	HARRY	Does anybody?
L355280	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	She has no real grip on reality.
L355279	u6367	m424	HARRY	What's her problem?
L355278	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
L355277	u6367	m424	HARRY	I won't say anything.
L355276	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
L355275	u6367	m424	HARRY	A Mister Quaid?
L355274	u6374	m424	TOFFLER	Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
L354972	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who is he?
L354971	u6372	m424	QUAID	Yes...
L354970	u6367	m424	HARRY	The Puritan?
L354969	u6372	m424	QUAID	I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
L354968	u6367	m424	HARRY	Hold on.
L354967	u6372	m424	QUAID	You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
L354966	u6367	m424	HARRY	Not much.
L354965	u6372	m424	QUAID	You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
L354964	u6367	m424	HARRY	Yeah.  You could say that.
L354963	u6372	m424	QUAID	You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
L354962	u6367	m424	HARRY	What?
L354961	u6372	m424	QUAID	My God.
L354959	u6372	m424	QUAID	Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
L354958	u6367	m424	HARRY	You need an ambulance.
L355194	u6377	m424	WILDER	No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
L355193	u6367	m424	HARRY	Have you been in?
L355192	u6377	m424	WILDER	That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
L355191	u6377	m424	WILDER	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
L355190	u6367	m424	HARRY	Are they all in the business?
L355189	u6377	m424	WILDER	You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
L355188	u6367	m424	HARRY	I only wear ties for funerals.
L355186	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well... nobody.
L355185	u6377	m424	WILDER	For an introduction.
L355184	u6367	m424	HARRY	For what?
L355183	u6377	m424	WILDER	People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
L355182	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
L355181	u6377	m424	WILDER	He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
L355180	u6367	m424	HARRY	Sure.  Vivovich.
L355179	u6377	m424	WILDER	You know Vinovich?
L355176	u6367	m424	HARRY	Not the Walter Wilder?
L355175	u6377	m424	WILDER	You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
L355174	u6367	m424	HARRY	Was he taking a lot of risks?
L355173	u6377	m424	WILDER	What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
L355172	u6367	m424	HARRY	I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
L355171	u6377	m424	WILDER	I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
L355170	u6367	m424	HARRY	Harry D'Amour.
L355169	u6377	m424	WILDER	At birth.  I don't know you --
L355168	u6367	m424	HARRY	That.
L355167	u6377	m424	WILDER	What?
L355166	u6367	m424	HARRY	Where'd you learn that?
L355685	u6367	m424	HARRY	Try.
L355684	u6373	m424	SWANN	I don't know.
L355683	u6367	m424	HARRY	Can you do it?
L355682	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes?
L355681	u6367	m424	HARRY	He did something with the ground.
L355606	u6373	m424	SWANN	I can't... I can't go any further...
L355605	u6367	m424	HARRY	You didn't try hard enough.
L355604	u6373	m424	SWANN	This is where we killed him.
L355591	u6367	m424	HARRY	Fuck.
L355590	u6373	m424	SWANN	At a guess... they just resurrected him.
L355589	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
L355572	u6367	m424	HARRY	In my time, and nobody else's.
L355571	u6373	m424	SWANN	That's where we're all going.
L355570	u6373	m424	SWANN	You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
L355569	u6367	m424	HARRY	Nobody's better off this wav!
L355568	u6373	m424	SWANN	He's better off this way.
L355567	u6367	m424	HARRY	... no...
L355549	u6373	m424	SWANN	Looks that way.
L355548	u6367	m424	HARRY	They got here before us.
L355527	u6367	m424	HARRY	Jesus!
L355526	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355525	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who else did?  Did Valentin?
L355524	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.
L355523	u6367	m424	HARRY	Did she know where Nix was buried?
L355518	u6373	m424	SWANN	I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
L355517	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you believed him?
L355516	u6373	m424	SWANN	No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
L355515	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is that all?
L355514	u6373	m424	SWANN	He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
L355513	u6367	m424	HARRY	And he didn't have them?
L355512	u6373	m424	SWANN	Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
L355511	u6367	m424	HARRY	And you're not?
L355510	u6373	m424	SWANN	I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
L355509	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is that all?
L355508	u6373	m424	SWANN	I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
L355507	u6367	m424	HARRY	Didn't know you read minds.
L355506	u6373	m424	SWANN	You think I'm an asshole.
L355499	u6373	m424	SWANN	Will that do?  No?
L355498	u6367	m424	HARRY	Oh Jeez.
L355491	u6367	m424	HARRY	Help me.
L355490	u6373	m424	SWANN	I don't know what else to do.
L355489	u6367	m424	HARRY	And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
L355488	u6373	m424	SWANN	It's me betrayed him.
L355487	u6367	m424	HARRY	So Nix won't come looking for her?
L355486	u6373	m424	SWANN	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
L355485	u6367	m424	HARRY	Oh yeah?
L355484	u6373	m424	SWANN	I did it for Dorothea.
L355483	u6367	m424	HARRY	Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
L355482	u6373	m424	SWANN	He deserved it.
L355481	u6367	m424	HARRY	Or murdered, like Nix.
L355480	u6373	m424	SWANN	Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
L355479	u6367	m424	HARRY	You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
L355477	u6373	m424	SWANN	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
L355476	u6367	m424	HARRY	I don't think so.  You need me alive.
L355475	u6373	m424	SWANN	Now I'm going to have to kill you.
L355474	u6367	m424	HARRY	How the fuck do you do that?
L355473	u6373	m424	SWANN	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
L355472	u6367	m424	HARRY	Look, Ma, no wires.
L355471	u6373	m424	SWANN	They'll never find out.
L355470	u6367	m424	HARRY	A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
L355102	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Who is she?
L355101	u6367	m424	HARRY	What?
L355100	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	One question.
L355099	u6367	m424	HARRY	A couple of weeks.
L355098	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
L355097	u6367	m424	HARRY	There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
L355096	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	Call me tomorrow.
L355095	u6367	m424	HARRY	I got to go.  I'm late.
L355094	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
L355093	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
L355092	u6369	m424	LOOMIS	The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
L355307	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
L355306	u6367	m424	HARRY	And he's dead?
L355305	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Yes! Yes!
L355304	u6367	m424	HARRY	Is he the Puritan?
L355303	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Nix! Nix!
L355302	u6367	m424	HARRY	Who's not?
L355301	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	He's not!  He's not!
L355296	u6367	m424	HARRY	Swann?
L355295	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
L355294	u6367	m424	HARRY	What is?
L355293	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
L355292	u6367	m424	HARRY	Why's that?
L355291	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
L355290	u6367	m424	HARRY	What about Philip Swann?
L355289	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Maybe... I... don't...
L355288	u6367	m424	HARRY	Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
L355287	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
L355286	u6367	m424	HARRY	No.
L355285	u6368	m424	JENNIFER	Have we met before?
L355646	u6371	m424	NIX	Liar!
L355645	u6373	m424	SWANN	No!
L355644	u6371	m424	NIX	Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
L355643	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355642	u6371	m424	NIX	But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
L355641	u6373	m424	SWANN	Yes.
L355640	u6371	m424	NIX	You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
L355633	u6371	m424	NIX	The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
L355632	u6373	m424	SWANN	Not true.
L355631	u6371	m424	NIX	Because you've got nothing else to live for.
L355630	u6373	m424	SWANN	Why would I want to?
L355629	u6371	m424	NIX	You could still help me do that.
L355628	u6371	m424	NIX	I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
L355627	u6373	m424	SWANN	And?
L354908	u6373	m424	SWANN	Binding you.
L354907	u6371	m424	NIX	Swann?  What are you doing?
L354898	u6371	m424	NIX	You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
L354897	u6373	m424	SWANN	Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
L354884	u6373	m424	SWANN	No!
L354883	u6371	m424	NIX	You don't think I've got it to give?
L354882	u6373	m424	SWANN	Fuck you.
L354881	u6371	m424	NIX	I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
L376243	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
L376242	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Dinner?  Again?
L376234	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Yeah, speak for yourself.
L376233	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Look who's talking.
L376182	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You think so?
L376181	u6544	m435	ALLISON	-- But he does seem very nice.
L376179	u6544	m435	ALLISON	...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
L376178	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
L376177	u6544	m435	ALLISON	...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
L375870	u6544	m435	ALLISON	And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
L375869	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's your name?
L375862	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
L375861	u6544	m435	ALLISON	You ate?
L375860	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
L375522	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
L375521	u6544	m435	ALLISON	I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
L376271	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
L376270	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
L375894	u6548	m435	DREW	Very.
L375893	u6544	m435	ALLISON	He's cute.
L375892	u6548	m435	DREW	That was 'Joe'.
L375828	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Love that name.
L375827	u6548	m435	DREW	Just plain 'Joe'?
L375823	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
L375822	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Daddy!  Come on, a name.
L375740	u6548	m435	DREW	Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
L375739	u6544	m435	ALLISON	His wife?
L375738	u6548	m435	DREW	He's coming.
L375737	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Did you speak to the Governor?
L376615	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Yes, it is.
L376614	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
L376612	u6544	m435	ALLISON	"But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, ""What does she want now?"""
L376611	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I wasn't going to say --
L376610	u6544	m435	ALLISON	That you've been to Susan?
L376609	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I haven't been the father to you that --
L376608	u6544	m435	ALLISON	They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
L376607	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
L376606	u6544	m435	ALLISON	I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
L376604	u6544	m435	ALLISON	-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
L376603	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do they, m'dear?
L376602	u6544	m435	ALLISON	The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
L376601	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
L376600	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
L376355	u6544	m435	ALLISON	'Goddam party'!
L376354	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh, the goddam party --
L376353	u6544	m435	ALLISON	It's for the party, Dad --
L376352	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't like cake.
L376351	u6544	m435	ALLISON	From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
L376350	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Who's Annie?
L376349	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Annie made them.
L376348	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is this?
L376200	u6544	m435	ALLISON	That's okay, Daddy.
L376199	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
L376198	u6544	m435	ALLISON	You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
L376197	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Of course.
L376196	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
L376195	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
L376194	u6544	m435	ALLISON	From the Korean War.
L376193	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Who?
L376192	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
L375882	u6552	m435	PARRISH	We've got some things to discuss.
L375881	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
L375836	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
L375835	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- Black.
L375819	u6552	m435	PARRISH	A name?
L375818	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
L375730	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
L375729	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
L375728	u6544	m435	ALLISON	And you could care less --
L375727	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know you do, darling.
L375726	u6544	m435	ALLISON	I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
L375725	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What, honey?
L375529	u6544	m435	ALLISON	No.
L375528	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
L375527	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
L375526	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I hate parties --
L375518	u6544	m435	ALLISON	But it's your birthday.
L375517	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
L375516	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
L375515	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
L375514	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Have you got a minute?
L375513	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hi, Allison --
L375512	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Daddy!
L376364	u6544	m435	ALLISON	What will I tell Annie?
L376363	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But what?
L376362	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Yeah, but --
L375845	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You know what I'm saying, Joe?
L375844	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Honey --!
L375843	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
L375842	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Paillarde of veal.
L375749	u6553	m435	QUINCE	No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
L375748	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
L375746	u6553	m435	QUINCE	He said he would be there with bells on.
L375745	u6544	m435	ALLISON	What about the Mayor?
L375567	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
L375566	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
L375565	u6544	m435	ALLISON	Honey, please.
L376620	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Both.
L376619	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	Red or white?
L376618	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
L376617	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
L375545	u6553	m435	QUINCE	9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
L375544	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
L375543	u6553	m435	QUINCE	What do you do that for?
L375542	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
L375541	u6553	m435	QUINCE	And that?
L375540	u6545	m435	AMBROSE	-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
L375539	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...This shit's not bad.
L375640	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
L375639	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I thought you were buying my company.
L375638	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
L375637	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry, I don't recall --
L375636	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
L375635	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
L375634	u6546	m435	BONTECOU	Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
L376251	u6547	m435	COYLE	Right away.
L376250	u6551	m435	JOE	Toast?  No...just the butter.
L376249	u6547	m435	COYLE	How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
L376248	u6551	m435	JOE	I would prefer some peanut butter.
L375934	u6547	m435	COYLE	I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
L375933	u6551	m435	JOE	'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
L375932	u6547	m435	COYLE	You mean this, sir?
L375931	u6551	m435	JOE	What are you eating.
L375930	u6547	m435	COYLE	Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
L375929	u6551	m435	JOE	Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
L375928	u6547	m435	COYLE	Yes, sir?
L376397	u6548	m435	DREW	So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
L376396	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
L376395	u6548	m435	DREW	Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
L376299	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah.  Goodnight.
L376298	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Well... goodnight.
L376297	u6548	m435	DREW	No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
L376296	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
L376295	u6548	m435	DREW	That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
L376294	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew, you're out of line.
L376293	u6548	m435	DREW	Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
L376292	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
L376291	u6548	m435	DREW	Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
L376290	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...See you tomorrow night.
L375884	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What 'business'?
L375883	u6548	m435	DREW	-- Did I hear 'business'?
L375548	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Hi.
L375547	u6548	m435	DREW	Hello, Beautiful.
L376446	u6554	m435	SLOANE	He'll wait --
L376445	u6548	m435	DREW	Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
L376444	u6554	m435	SLOANE	We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
L376337	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Hello, Quince.
L376336	u6548	m435	DREW	Thank you for coming.
L376334	u6548	m435	DREW	Am I not obligated to?
L376333	u6554	m435	SLOANE	You're taking this too far, Drew.
L376332	u6548	m435	DREW	Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
L376331	u6554	m435	SLOANE	And what would that be?
L376770	u6548	m435	DREW	The dagger --?
L376769	u6551	m435	JOE	I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
L376768	u6548	m435	DREW	I'm not stepping anywhere --
L376764	u6551	m435	JOE	-- And now you're going to pee some more.
L376763	u6548	m435	DREW	So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
L376392	u6548	m435	DREW	Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
L376391	u6551	m435	JOE	No, I don't --
L376273	u6548	m435	DREW	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
L376272	u6551	m435	JOE	Perhaps you could remind me.
L376268	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
L376267	u6548	m435	DREW	Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
L376266	u6551	m435	JOE	But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
L376265	u6548	m435	DREW	Who are we talking about?
L376231	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
L376230	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376155	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376154	u6548	m435	DREW	May I interrupting?
L376054	u6551	m435	JOE	Then why did you bring it up?
L376053	u6548	m435	DREW	It doesn't matter.
L376052	u6551	m435	JOE	Of whom?
L376051	u6548	m435	DREW	It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
L376050	u6551	m435	JOE	What an odd pairing.
L376049	u6548	m435	DREW	Yes.
L376048	u6551	m435	JOE	Death and Taxes?
L376047	u6548	m435	DREW	Yes.
L376038	u6548	m435	DREW	And a glass.
L376037	u6551	m435	JOE	Cold.
L376036	u6548	m435	DREW	Hot or cold.
L376035	u6551	m435	JOE	Why yes, thank you.
L376034	u6548	m435	DREW	Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
L376033	u6551	m435	JOE	Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
L376032	u6548	m435	DREW	The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
L376031	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you.
L376030	u6548	m435	DREW	Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
L375873	u6548	m435	DREW	'Here'?
L375872	u6551	m435	JOE	Here...
L375871	u6548	m435	DREW	Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
L375858	u6548	m435	DREW	Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
L375857	u6551	m435	JOE	I didn't say.
L375856	u6548	m435	DREW	What side of the industry did you say you were on?
L375855	u6551	m435	JOE	We have an arrangement now.
L376788	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
L376787	u6548	m435	DREW	You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
L376786	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You get not to go to jail.
L376785	u6548	m435	DREW	And what do I get?
L376784	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
L376783	u6548	m435	DREW	I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
L376761	u6548	m435	DREW	Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
L376760	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
L376759	u6548	m435	DREW	I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
L376452	u6548	m435	DREW	Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
L376451	u6552	m435	PARRISH	In English, please.
L376450	u6548	m435	DREW	But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
L376449	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
L376443	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Are you running this Board or am I?
L376442	u6548	m435	DREW	Certainly, Bill.
L376441	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
L376440	u6548	m435	DREW	So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
L376439	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
L376438	u6548	m435	DREW	Don't you want to hear the details?
L376437	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The answer is no, quick enough for you?
L376436	u6548	m435	DREW	Bontecou wants a quick response and --
L376435	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's it?
L376433	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't think so.  Do you?
L376432	u6548	m435	DREW	Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
L376388	u6548	m435	DREW	Certainly.  Goodnight.
L376387	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I think it's time you went home, Drew.
L376386	u6548	m435	DREW	I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
L376385	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
L376384	u6548	m435	DREW	Yours.
L376383	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Whose?
L376382	u6548	m435	DREW	With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
L376381	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't care.
L376380	u6548	m435	DREW	What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
L376379	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Over my dead body.
L376378	u6548	m435	DREW	If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
L376377	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What are their feelings?
L376376	u6548	m435	DREW	Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
L376375	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
L376279	u6548	m435	DREW	Sure.
L376278	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
L376277	u6548	m435	DREW	I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
L376259	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Please, Drew.
L376258	u6548	m435	DREW	Mind if I throw up?
L376226	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
L376225	u6548	m435	DREW	For how long?  And why?
L376224	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
L376223	u6548	m435	DREW	As much as Joe's?
L376222	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
L376167	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
L376166	u6548	m435	DREW	I thought this was practically a done deal --
L376165	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
L376163	u6548	m435	DREW	I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
L376162	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Why?
L376161	u6548	m435	DREW	How nice for you both.
L376160	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
L376159	u6548	m435	DREW	Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
L376158	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sit down, Drew.
L376157	u6548	m435	DREW	'Just kidding'?
L376156	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No.
L376059	u6548	m435	DREW	But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
L376058	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Shall we adjourn?
L376057	u6548	m435	DREW	Glad I could be of some help.
L376056	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I am now.
L376055	u6548	m435	DREW	"You're not familiar with the phrase, ""In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes""?"
L376045	u6548	m435	DREW	That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
L376044	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
L376043	u6548	m435	DREW	...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
L375854	u6548	m435	DREW	I get the feeling you've done some business before.
L375853	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No --
L375849	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Uh -- he's from out of town --
L375848	u6548	m435	DREW	Have we met?
L375834	u6548	m435	DREW	Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
L375833	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What do you mean?
L375832	u6548	m435	DREW	Is there any more to it?
L375831	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes.
L375830	u6548	m435	DREW	'Joe...'
L375825	u6548	m435	DREW	What?!
L375824	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
L375821	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
L375820	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah, something he goes by --
L375679	u6548	m435	DREW	Olympic.
L375678	u6552	m435	PARRISH	As close as a deal could be.
L375677	u6548	m435	DREW	So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
L375674	u6548	m435	DREW	You have a way with words.
L375673	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Like a marriage made in heaven?
L375672	u6548	m435	DREW	I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
L375671	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Me, too.
L375670	u6548	m435	DREW	I'm all excited --
L375633	u6548	m435	DREW	That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
L375632	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
L375630	u6548	m435	DREW	Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
L375629	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do you think I need a haircut?
L375628	u6548	m435	DREW	It's going to be great --
L375627	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sounds good.
L375626	u6548	m435	DREW	...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
L375615	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No no, not you.
L375614	u6548	m435	DREW	Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
L375613	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Did you just hear something?
L375612	u6548	m435	DREW	I was saying to Quince we won't need --
L375557	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
L375556	u6548	m435	DREW	'Yes' to the deal?
L375555	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Yes'.
L375554	u6548	m435	DREW	What'd it say?
L375553	u6552	m435	PARRISH	In my sleep.
L375552	u6548	m435	DREW	A voice?
L375551	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
L375550	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
L375549	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
L376753	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
L376752	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
L376751	u6548	m435	DREW	He said that?
L376750	u6553	m435	QUINCE	He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
L376749	u6548	m435	DREW	This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
L376469	u6548	m435	DREW	Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
L376468	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
L376467	u6548	m435	DREW	The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
L376466	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But I didn't mean to do it!
L376465	u6548	m435	DREW	Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
L376464	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I'm going to put a stop to this!
L376463	u6548	m435	DREW	That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
L376462	u6553	m435	QUINCE	What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
L376347	u6553	m435	QUINCE	That's what he said.
L376346	u6548	m435	DREW	'It's up to Joe'?
L376345	u6553	m435	QUINCE	The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
L376344	u6548	m435	DREW	-- But he was concerned about the timing?
L376343	u6553	m435	QUINCE	He was interested.
L376342	u6548	m435	DREW	How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
L376341	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
L376275	u6548	m435	DREW	You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
L376274	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
L376212	u6548	m435	DREW	Yeah.  Neat.
L376211	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
L376210	u6548	m435	DREW	Well, that's very interesting.
L376209	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah, that's what he said.
L376208	u6548	m435	DREW	'It's up to Joe', huh?
L376207	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah.
L376206	u6548	m435	DREW	'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
L376205	u6553	m435	QUINCE	We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
L376204	u6548	m435	DREW	Are you?
L376203	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
L376202	u6548	m435	DREW	Thanks, Quince.
L376201	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
L375868	u6548	m435	DREW	Joe, you do get around.
L375867	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Well, I guess he's found one.
L375755	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
L375754	u6548	m435	DREW	You're overthinking it --
L375609	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I know.  Gum up the works.
L375608	u6548	m435	DREW	Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
L375607	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
L376551	u6551	m435	JOE	Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
L376550	u6549	m435	EASTER	Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.

L376537	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.

L376535	u6551	m435	JOE	Nuthin'.

L376107	u6549	m435	EASTER	Obeah.
L376430	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Didn't you call a Board meeting?
L376429	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What?
L376428	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	The Board is waiting.
L376427	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning, Jennifer.
L376426	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
L376024	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
L376023	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Jennifer.
L376022	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Didn't the family get together last night --?
L376021	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
L375707	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Nothing?
L375706	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No.  Nothing.
L375705	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
L375704	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sure.
L375703	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
L375676	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hi, Jennifer.
L375675	u6550	m435	JENNIFER	Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
L376645	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376644	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
L376641	u6551	m435	JOE	Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
L376640	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You think so?  How do you know?
L376638	u6553	m435	QUINCE	What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
L376637	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
L376636	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.
L376635	u6551	m435	JOE	What do you mean 'free'?
L376634	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
L376633	u6551	m435	JOE	'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
L376632	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
L376631	u6551	m435	JOE	But she loves you?
L376630	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
L376629	u6551	m435	JOE	How did you meet?
L376628	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Oh yes, I do.
L376627	u6551	m435	JOE	You love Allison, don't you?
L376626	u6553	m435	QUINCE	'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
L376625	u6551	m435	JOE	Love.
L376624	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Confused, huh?  About what?
L376623	u6551	m435	JOE	Do I?  I'm a little confused.
L376622	u6553	m435	QUINCE	C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
L376373	u6551	m435	JOE	You're welcome.
L376372	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Thanks.
L376371	u6551	m435	JOE	And you're a nice man, Quince.
L376370	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
L376369	u6551	m435	JOE	On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
L376368	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I didn't know that.
L376367	u6551	m435	JOE	Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
L376191	u6553	m435	QUINCE	No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
L376190	u6551	m435	JOE	That's very gracious of you, Quince.
L375886	u6551	m435	JOE	It's so very nice to see you again.
L375885	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Don't bother asking, we already tried.
L375879	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Hey, this is fun.
L375878	u6551	m435	JOE	Black.
L375851	u6551	m435	JOE	As long as it takes.
L375850	u6553	m435	QUINCE	How long you here, Joe?
L375840	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you?
L375839	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
L375838	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes?
L375837	u6553	m435	QUINCE	'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
L376844	u6551	m435	JOE	Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
L376843	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You think so?
L376842	u6551	m435	JOE	Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
L376841	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's it?
L376738	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you for loving me.
L376737	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- Yes?
L376736	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan --
L376735	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Hold me --
L376734	u6551	m435	JOE	I love you now, I'll love you always --
L376733	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
L376732	u6555	m435	SUSAN	But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
L376731	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm still here.
L376726	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
L376725	u6551	m435	JOE	I - uh --
L376724	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
L376723	u6551	m435	JOE	The 'coffee shop' --
L376722	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
L376721	u6551	m435	JOE	Did I say that?
L376668	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes, that's why I said it.
L376667	u6551	m435	JOE	I believe that, don't you?
L376666	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It's a saying.
L376665	u6551	m435	JOE	'Love will find out the way'?
L376664	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'Love will find out the way'.
L376663	u6551	m435	JOE	What will we do?
L376662	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
L376661	u6551	m435	JOE	Will it?
L376660	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Don't.  That will come later.
L376659	u6551	m435	JOE	But there's so much to tell you --
L376658	u6555	m435	SUSAN	We know all that we need to know --
L376657	u6551	m435	JOE	We know so little about each other --
L376656	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Then don't.
L376655	u6551	m435	JOE	No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
L376654	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It gets worse.
L376653	u6551	m435	JOE	I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
L376652	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And you can't tell me who you are.
L376651	u6551	m435	JOE	Well -- I --
L376650	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where are you going?
L376649	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
L376648	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
L376647	u6551	m435	JOE	I love you in an evening gown.
L376646	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I like you in a black tie.
L376499	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh, I hope a long, long time.
L376498	u6555	m435	SUSAN	For how long?
L376497	u6551	m435	JOE	Nowhere?  I'm...here.
L376496	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where are you going?
L376495	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes!
L376494	u6555	m435	SUSAN	More than you love peanut butter?
L376493	u6551	m435	JOE	I loved it.
L376492	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Did you like making love to me?
L376489	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Maybe it's the draft through the door.
L376488	u6551	m435	JOE	...No.
L376486	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
L376485	u6555	m435	SUSAN	He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
L376484	u6551	m435	JOE	He's taking a nap.
L376482	u6551	m435	JOE	How beautiful.
L376481	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
L376480	u6551	m435	JOE	I am.
L376479	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're here?
L376418	u6551	m435	JOE	Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
L376417	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And is your heart beating strangely?
L376416	u6551	m435	JOE	Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
L376415	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I don't know who you are.
L376414	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes?
L376410	u6551	m435	JOE	Why, yes.  Thank you.
L376409	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
L376408	u6551	m435	JOE	-- Could you?
L376407	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It was everything.
L376406	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you.
L376405	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- I guess you haven't.
L376404	u6551	m435	JOE	I love your smell.
L376402	u6551	m435	JOE	Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
L376401	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry about --
L376399	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I said get out.
L376398	u6551	m435	JOE	Almost.
L376394	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why don't you get off his case?
L376393	u6551	m435	JOE	You first.
L376315	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.  I'm tired.
L376314	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'To bed'?
L376313	u6551	m435	JOE	To bed.
L376312	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where are you going?
L376309	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376308	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Gay?
L376307	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376306	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Girlfriend?
L376305	u6551	m435	JOE	No, I'm not.
L376304	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
L376303	u6551	m435	JOE	Why?
L376301	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
L376300	u6555	m435	SUSAN	How long have you been standing there?
L376264	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry to hear that.
L376263	u6555	m435	SUSAN	We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
L376262	u6551	m435	JOE	Has her pain abated?
L376261	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I am, too.
L376260	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
L376257	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes...I've found that it does.
L376256	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It comforts you, doesn't it?
L376255	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes...
L376254	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
L376253	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't know.
L376252	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why do you love peanut butter so much?
L376220	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And I appreciate you, too.
L376219	u6551	m435	JOE	I mean I appreciate that.
L376218	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Excuse me?
L376217	u6551	m435	JOE	I appreciate you --
L376216	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
L376215	u6551	m435	JOE	Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
L376214	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
L376213	u6551	m435	JOE	I wanted to apologize, Susan --
L376137	u6551	m435	JOE	Be sorry for nothing.
L376136	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
L376135	u6551	m435	JOE	Not now.
L376134	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Joe, I'm with Drew.
L376128	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes.
L376127	u6551	m435	JOE	She's in a great deal of pain.
L376093	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't mind --
L376092	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Patients have visitors, not doctors.
L376091	u6551	m435	JOE	And I'll be a visitor.
L376090	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
L376089	u6551	m435	JOE	Whatever you do.
L376088	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Watch me do what?
L376087	u6551	m435	JOE	Very well, I'll watch.
L376086	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
L376085	u6551	m435	JOE	I came to see you.
L376084	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Then why are you here, Joe?
L376083	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh goodness, no.
L376081	u6551	m435	JOE	How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
L376080	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Joe --
L375972	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
L375971	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes?
L375969	u6551	m435	JOE	Goodnight to you, Susan.
L375968	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Goodnight, Joe.
L375967	u6551	m435	JOE	Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
L375966	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes?
L375965	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan?
L375964	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
L375963	u6551	m435	JOE	I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
L375962	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes --?
L375960	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I can see why.
L375959	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't have any.
L375958	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I've got plenty of friends.
L375957	u6551	m435	JOE	I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
L375956	u6555	m435	SUSAN	No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
L375955	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
L375954	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
L375953	u6551	m435	JOE	When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
L375952	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Come again?
L375951	u6551	m435	JOE	Do you love Drew?
L375950	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- What kind of childhood did you have?
L375949	u6551	m435	JOE	I haven't.
L375948	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You act like you never had peanut butter before --
L375947	u6551	m435	JOE	Peanut butter.
L375946	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
L375945	u6551	m435	JOE	That is not my intention.
L375944	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
L375943	u6551	m435	JOE	I am Joe.
L375942	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
L375941	u6551	m435	JOE	'Big'?
L375939	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry.
L375938	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- Can't seem to escape you today.
L375937	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm lost.
L375936	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What are you doing here?
L376834	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's life.  What can I tell you?
L376833	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376829	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376828	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I guess you have your reasons.
L376827	u6551	m435	JOE	Not exactly.
L376826	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank you.
L376825	u6551	m435	JOE	Happy Birthday, Bill.
L376782	u6551	m435	JOE	An indictable offense.
L376781	u6552	m435	PARRISH	An offense --
L376780	u6551	m435	JOE	Undisclosed conflict of interest --
L376779	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
L376778	u6551	m435	JOE	And we're very grateful.
L376777	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
L376775	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- An IRS man.
L376774	u6551	m435	JOE	I'll take it from here --  I am --
L376773	u6552	m435	PARRISH	He is --
L376772	u6551	m435	JOE	Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
L376771	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I told you to shut up.
L376767	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
L376766	u6551	m435	JOE	It's time to put this person where he belongs.
L376765	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, don't do this --
L376746	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Get him in here.
L376745	u6551	m435	JOE	Okay.
L376715	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
L376714	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you threatening me?
L376713	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't expect you to.
L376712	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't like what you're saying.
L376711	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Does she know where she's going?
L376710	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376709	u6552	m435	PARRISH	With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
L376708	u6551	m435	JOE	Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
L376707	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, they're mine now.
L376706	u6551	m435	JOE	Those were my words, Bill.
L376705	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L376704	u6551	m435	JOE	So that's what love is?
L376703	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
L376702	u6551	m435	JOE	Which is what?
L376701	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
L376700	u6551	m435	JOE	Then what is it?
L376699	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
L376698	u6551	m435	JOE	I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
L376697	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
L376696	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry, Bill --
L376695	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
L376694	u6551	m435	JOE	I think you heard me, Bill.
L376693	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're what?
L376692	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
L376691	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Say again?
L376690	u6551	m435	JOE	-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
L376689	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
L376688	u6551	m435	JOE	I was just asking, Bill.
L376687	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What the hell do you care?
L376686	u6551	m435	JOE	Not at all.
L376685	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thanks.
L376588	u6551	m435	JOE	Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
L376587	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yeah.
L376586	u6551	m435	JOE	You are?
L376585	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What are you saying, that it's time to go?
L376584	u6551	m435	JOE	-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
L376583	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes?
L376582	u6551	m435	JOE	Uh --
L376525	u6551	m435	JOE	I told you, 'watch it'.
L376524	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
L376523	u6551	m435	JOE	May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
L376522	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And I don't give a shit.
L376521	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
L376520	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
L376519	u6551	m435	JOE	This universe?
L376518	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're violating the laws of the universe.
L376515	u6551	m435	JOE	I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
L376514	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
L376513	u6551	m435	JOE	'Spooning'?
L376512	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
L376511	u6551	m435	JOE	With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
L376510	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm her father!
L376509	u6551	m435	JOE	I'll be the judge of that.
L376508	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
L376507	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes, I saw you see me.
L376505	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry to hear that.
L376504	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I couldn't sleep.
L376478	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Then I can't help you.
L376477	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm not hungry.
L376476	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
L376475	u6551	m435	JOE	'Fish'?
L376474	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
L376473	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Just a manner of speaking.
L376472	u6551	m435	JOE	What's okay?
L376471	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's okay.
L376470	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sorry, Bill --
L376425	u6551	m435	JOE	Goodnight.
L376424	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Okay.  Goodnight.
L376423	u6551	m435	JOE	Um -- not right now.
L376422	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
L376421	u6551	m435	JOE	Hello, Bill.
L376289	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you going to fire me, Bill?
L376288	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
L376287	u6551	m435	JOE	You tell me, Bill.
L376286	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What way would you put it?
L376285	u6551	m435	JOE	I wouldn't put it that way.
L376284	u6552	m435	PARRISH	About Susan?
L376283	u6551	m435	JOE	I guess...
L376282	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You were just curious?
L376281	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't know.
L376280	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Why did you go to the hospital?
L376176	u6551	m435	JOE	Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
L376175	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
L376174	u6551	m435	JOE	Okay.
L376173	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
L376172	u6551	m435	JOE	Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
L376170	u6551	m435	JOE	Absolutely.
L376169	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Dinner?  Absolutely.
L376152	u6551	m435	JOE	This part I'm interested in.
L376151	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
L376150	u6551	m435	JOE	Well...I don't know.
L376149	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Why didn't you stop me?
L376148	u6551	m435	JOE	And more.
L376147	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
L376146	u6551	m435	JOE	Uh-huh.
L376145	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
L376144	u6551	m435	JOE	Truly - uh - splendid.
L376143	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
L376142	u6551	m435	JOE	Excellent.  What is it?
L376141	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's all yours.
L376140	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you going to eat your lunch
L376079	u6551	m435	JOE	No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
L376078	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
L376075	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh.  Okay.
L376074	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Now I'd like to be alone.
L376073	u6551	m435	JOE	Of course.
L376072	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
L376071	u6551	m435	JOE	You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
L376070	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
L376069	u6551	m435	JOE	Are you sad, Bill?
L376068	u6552	m435	PARRISH	...I'd like to be alone for a while.
L376067	u6551	m435	JOE	I don't understand.
L376066	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
L376040	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes.
L376039	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Would you like to sit down, Joe?
L376028	u6551	m435	JOE	I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
L376027	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
L376026	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L376025	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
L376016	u6551	m435	JOE	So can I.
L376015	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes.
L376014	u6551	m435	JOE	Can you keep a secret?
L376013	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What's it like where I'm going?
L376012	u6551	m435	JOE	What do you mean?
L376011	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What's it like?
L376010	u6551	m435	JOE	I understand.
L376009	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I want to live.
L376008	u6551	m435	JOE	That's what everybody says.
L376007	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm not everybody.
L376006	u6551	m435	JOE	That's what everybody says.
L376005	u6552	m435	PARRISH	-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
L376004	u6551	m435	JOE	Not this.
L376003	u6552	m435	PARRISH	There's one to every rule.
L376002	u6551	m435	JOE	Make an exception?
L376001	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How about giving a guy a break?
L376000	u6551	m435	JOE	Yes, Bill.
L375999	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe --?
L375998	u6551	m435	JOE	So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L375997	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Of course.
L375996	u6551	m435	JOE	So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
L375995	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I guess so.
L375994	u6551	m435	JOE	You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
L375993	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What do you mean?
L375992	u6551	m435	JOE	When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
L375989	u6551	m435	JOE	You've got a deal.
L375988	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes?
L375987	u6551	m435	JOE	Bill --
L375986	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
L375985	u6551	m435	JOE	A 'deal'?
L375984	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It is a deal?
L375983	u6551	m435	JOE	Sounds fair enough.
L375982	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And I won't tell anyone who you are.
L375981	u6551	m435	JOE	And what?
L375979	u6551	m435	JOE	Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
L375978	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
L375977	u6551	m435	JOE	'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
L375976	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How are you?  How're you feeling?
L375975	u6551	m435	JOE	Good morning, Bill.
L375974	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning.
L375922	u6551	m435	JOE	Good night to you, Bill.
L375921	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
L375920	u6551	m435	JOE	Not at all.
L375919	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, thank you for letting me know.
L375918	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Closer than that.
L375917	u6551	m435	JOE	I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
L375916	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No --
L375915	u6551	m435	JOE	Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
L375914	u6552	m435	PARRISH	...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
L375913	u6551	m435	JOE	That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
L375912	u6552	m435	PARRISH	When you go, I go.
L375911	u6551	m435	JOE	You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
L375910	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How long have I got?
L375909	u6551	m435	JOE	I won't.
L375908	u6552	m435	PARRISH	If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
L375907	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L375906	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
L375905	u6551	m435	JOE	What a good idea.
L375902	u6551	m435	JOE	It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
L375901	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
L375900	u6551	m435	JOE	No.
L375899	u6552	m435	PARRISH	So there's nothing between you and Susan?
L375898	u6551	m435	JOE	I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
L375897	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
L375896	u6551	m435	JOE	'Threw' you?  Where?
L375895	u6552	m435	PARRISH	...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
L375891	u6551	m435	JOE	Thank you.
L375890	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe, that's the kitchen.
L375847	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
L375846	u6551	m435	JOE	No --
L375811	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Then don't.
L375810	u6552	m435	PARRISH	When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
L375809	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Speak up, please.
L375808	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It just occurred to me --
L375807	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Of course.
L375806	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Excuse me?  Could I say something?
L375805	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
L375804	u6552	m435	PARRISH	This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
L375801	u6552	m435	PARRISH	And then --?
L375800	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You should hope quite a while.
L375799	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I do?  How long will you be staying?
L375798	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You fill the bill, Bill.
L375797	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You want me to be your guide --?
L375796	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
L375795	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
L375794	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	That's me.
L375793	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Death!
L375792	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Yes.
L375790	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	'...Yes --'
L375789	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You are --?
L375788	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
L375787	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I am not a dream.
L375786	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
L375783	u6556	m435	VOICE	Yes, Bill.  The question.
L375782	u6552	m435	PARRISH	The 'question' --
L375781	u6556	m435	VOICE	Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
L375780	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What question?
L375779	u6556	m435	VOICE	'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
L375778	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes what?
L375777	u6556	m435	VOICE	In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
L375776	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry --
L375775	u6556	m435	VOICE	Watch it!
L375774	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What the hell are you talking about?
L375773	u6556	m435	VOICE	Time.
L375772	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Get what?
L375771	u6556	m435	VOICE	Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
L375770	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'The one' to do what?
L375769	u6556	m435	VOICE	It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
L375768	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Take me'...?  Where?
L375767	u6556	m435	VOICE	I want to have a look around before I take you.
L375766	u6552	m435	PARRISH	About what?
L375765	u6556	m435	VOICE	Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
L375764	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What the hell is this?  Who are you?
L375763	u6556	m435	VOICE	The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
L375761	u6556	m435	VOICE	Quiet.
L375760	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
L375759	u6556	m435	VOICE	I'm here.
L375758	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Where are you?
L375701	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
L375700	u6556	m435	VOICE	I think you know --
L375699	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What do you mean?!
L375698	u6556	m435	VOICE	There's going to be plenty of time for that.
L375697	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Please.  Talk to me --
L375696	u6556	m435	VOICE	It's enough now.
L375695	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Where are you?  Are you there?
L375694	u6556	m435	VOICE	No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
L375693	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry, I --
L375692	u6556	m435	VOICE	Are you giving me orders?
L375690	u6556	m435	VOICE	What you were talking about.
L375689	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What are you talking about?
L375688	u6556	m435	VOICE	Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
L375687	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't!
L375686	u6556	m435	VOICE	I think you know --
L375684	u6556	m435	VOICE	I believe you did.
L375683	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I didn't ask any question.
L375682	u6556	m435	VOICE	'Yes' is the answer to your question.
L375681	u6552	m435	PARRISH	'Yes' what?
L375611	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What?
L375610	u6556	m435	VOICE	'...I know, it's none of my business.'
L376684	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Sir, I'll deliver the package.
L376683	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Quince, I've got confidence in you.
L376682	u6553	m435	QUINCE	You think Drew will go for it?
L376681	u6552	m435	PARRISH	All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
L376676	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, I believe I do.
L376675	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
L376674	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Sure.
L376673	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
L376671	u6552	m435	PARRISH	It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
L376670	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
L376366	u6553	m435	QUINCE	The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
L376365	u6552	m435	PARRISH	This one.
L376361	u6553	m435	QUINCE	See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
L376360	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yeah, I give a shit.
L376359	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
L376357	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
L376356	u6553	m435	QUINCE	This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
L376189	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
L376188	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
L376187	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Yeah.  Or the week after.
L376186	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Next week?
L376185	u6553	m435	QUINCE	But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
L376184	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank you, Quince.
L376183	u6553	m435	QUINCE	...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
L375564	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
L375563	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How's that, Quince?
L375562	u6553	m435	QUINCE	I am, this is it.  B Day.
L375561	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm doing great.  You ready?
L375560	u6553	m435	QUINCE	How're you doing--?
L375559	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Good morning, Quince.
L375558	u6553	m435	QUINCE	Hi, Bill --
L376793	u6554	m435	SLOANE	But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
L376792	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
L376756	u6554	m435	SLOANE	We're all ears.
L376755	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
L376754	u6554	m435	SLOANE	We're all here, Bill --
L376599	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
L376598	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
L376597	u6552	m435	PARRISH	If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
L376596	u6554	m435	SLOANE	No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
L376595	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
L376594	u6554	m435	SLOANE	The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
L376593	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
L376592	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
L376591	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Eddie?
L376461	u6554	m435	SLOANE	I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
L376460	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
L376459	u6554	m435	SLOANE	I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
L376458	u6552	m435	PARRISH	"Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"" shit."
L376457	u6554	m435	SLOANE	...It's not over, 'til it's over.
L376061	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
L376060	u6554	m435	SLOANE	Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
L376823	u6555	m435	SUSAN	The fireworks are about to start.
L376822	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What was that?
L376817	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
L376816	u6552	m435	PARRISH	If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
L376815	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Oh, yes --
L376814	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
L376810	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's why it's okay.
L376809	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I love you, Daddy --
L376808	u6552	m435	PARRISH	No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
L376807	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Daddy --
L376806	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
L376805	u6555	m435	SUSAN	But what?
L376804	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yes, but --
L376803	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Are you relieved?
L376802	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm sorry.
L376801	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
L376800	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I'm having a helluva time.
L376799	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What a night.
L376574	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
L376573	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I love him.
L376572	u6552	m435	PARRISH	In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
L376571	u6555	m435	SUSAN	C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
L376570	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't know, I can't say --
L376569	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where's he going?
L376568	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
L376567	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
L376566	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You don't know anything about Joe --
L376565	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
L376564	u6552	m435	PARRISH	This is crazy --
L376563	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
L376562	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't understand.
L376561	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
L376560	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't know.
L376559	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where is he?
L376558	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Joe?
L376557	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Where's Joe?
L376329	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It's something.
L376328	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Then what is it?
L376327	u6555	m435	SUSAN	When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
L376326	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Nothing.
L376325	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
L376324	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
L376323	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Then what will you say?
L376322	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
L376321	u6555	m435	SUSAN	"Well, remember how you told me about ""lightning striking""?  The nature of it's in there somewhere."
L376320	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
L376319	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Raise away.
L376318	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
L376317	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yeah, it's good to get together.
L376316	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That was wonderful.
L376239	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Will it?...
L376238	u6555	m435	SUSAN	It'll come back, Daddy.
L375888	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
L375887	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
L375877	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
L375876	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
L375866	u6555	m435	SUSAN	-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
L375865	u6552	m435	PARRISH	What?!
L375864	u6555	m435	SUSAN	We've met.
L375863	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You know each other?
L375625	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Yer damn right.
L375624	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Well, go get 'em, Pops.
L375623	u6552	m435	PARRISH	A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
L375622	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Are you okay?
L375620	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Nothing.
L375619	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What is it, Daddy --?
L375617	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Nothing.  I'm sorry.
L375616	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Daddy, what's the matter?
L375606	u6552	m435	PARRISH	He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
L375605	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Thank God.
L375604	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
L375603	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're terrible.
L375602	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
L375601	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
L375600	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
L375599	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
L375598	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Aw, you're tough.
L375597	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Bravo.
L375596	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
L375595	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
L375594	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
L375593	u6555	m435	SUSAN	That's all?
L375592	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
L375591	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Don't get dirty, Dad --
L375590	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
L375589	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're not listening --
L375588	u6552	m435	PARRISH	That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
L375587	u6555	m435	SUSAN	So what's wrong with that?
L375586	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
L375585	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What were you going to say?
L375584	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Well, I wasn't going to say that --
L375583	u6555	m435	SUSAN	And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
L375582	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
L375581	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Uh oh --
L375580	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Don't get carried away.
L375579	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Probably.
L375578	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
L375577	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You mean like you loved Mom?
L375576	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Do you love Drew?
L375574	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I know it's none of my business --
L375573	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...There's a start for a meeting.
L375572	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I am.  With you.
L375571	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I thought you were in a meeting--?
L375570	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
L375569	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You're only six-five once.
L375568	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Not my birthday again?
L375538	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...Then don't.
L375537	u6552	m435	PARRISH	I don't like to interfere.
L375536	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yeah.  I guess so.
L375535	u6552	m435	PARRISH	You like him, don't you?
L375534	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I hope so.
L375533	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Does Drew tell you everything?
L375532	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Drew told me.
L375531	u6552	m435	PARRISH	How did you know?
L375530	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
L375524	u6555	m435	SUSAN	He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
L375523	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Drew's aboard?
L375520	u6552	m435	PARRISH	Hi, honey.
L375519	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Good morning, Dad.
L376855	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	But we've got time.
L376854	u6555	m435	SUSAN	...We know so little about each other.
L376851	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Y'didn't?
L376850	u6555	m435	SUSAN	No --
L376849	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You said you liked me.
L375723	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
L375722	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Why not?
L375721	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
L375720	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
L375719	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Why?
L375718	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
L375717	u6555	m435	SUSAN	No, it was so right it scares me.
L375716	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Did I say something wrong?
L375715	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I've got to go --
L375714	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	You never know.  Lightning could strike.
L375713	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
L375712	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I would.
L375711	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
L375710	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
L375709	u6555	m435	SUSAN	'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
L375708	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	...It's kind of a pro bono job.
L375669	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
L375668	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I've got patients coming in --
L375667	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	How 'bout another cup of coffee?
L375666	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Not at all.
L375665	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
L375664	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
L375663	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	'Her'.
L375662	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I could be her.
L375661	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
L375660	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Me?  Internal medicine.
L375659	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
L375658	u6555	m435	SUSAN	How'd you know?
L375657	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
L375656	u6555	m435	SUSAN	So you're a one-girl guy?
L375655	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
L375654	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
L375653	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Why?
L375652	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I agree --
L375651	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Nothing lasts.
L375650	u6555	m435	SUSAN	What's the way?
L375649	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
L375648	u6555	m435	SUSAN	I'm sorry --
L375647	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
L375646	u6555	m435	SUSAN	You and 'Honey'?
L375645	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
L375644	u6555	m435	SUSAN	Not at all.  It was fascinating.
L375643	u6557	m435	YOUNG MAN	Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.

L415079	u6873	m459	SHOCK	Shock.
L415046	u6872	m459	SALLY	Experiments?
L415045	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	He's conducting experiments of his own.
L415044	u6872	m459	SALLY	When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
L415043	u6872	m459	SALLY	He stayed a long time.
L415042	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Uh-huh.
L414994	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
L414993	u6872	m459	SALLY	Can't you make other creations?
L414992	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
L414990	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
L414989	u6872	m459	SALLY	But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
L414987	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
L414986	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
L414985	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Why not?
L414984	u6872	m459	SALLY	No.

L414974	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Good.  I'm hungry.

L414932	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Just what?
L414931	u6872	m459	SALLY	That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
L414930	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
L414929	u6872	m459	SALLY	I know.
L414928	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
L414927	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
L414926	u6872	m459	SALLY	I can't help it.
L414925	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
L414924	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.

L414917	u6872	m459	SALLY	Yes.
L414916	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	For this.

L415075	u6871	m459	LOCK	We're here!  You sent for us!
L416759	u6878	m460	JESSE	Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
L416758	u6875	m460	DAD	Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
L416756	u6878	m460	JESSE	And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
L416755	u6875	m460	DAD	I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
L416744	u6875	m460	DAD	You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
L416743	u6878	m460	JESSE	What are you talking about?
L416742	u6875	m460	DAD	You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
L416734	u6875	m460	DAD	Don't tell me it's not the gas!
L416733	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's not the gas, Dad!
L416732	u6875	m460	DAD	Help me with this thing!
L416688	u6875	m460	DAD	No.  Upstairs.
L416687	u6878	m460	JESSE	Oh, come on Dad...
L416686	u6875	m460	DAD	I told you I want that room unpacked.
L416685	u6878	m460	JESSE	Just out for a while.
L416684	u6875	m460	DAD	Where are you going?
L416612	u6875	m460	DAD	Who's Lisa?
L416611	u6878	m460	JESSE	That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
L416606	u6875	m460	DAD	Don't be a smart ass.
L416605	u6878	m460	JESSE	Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
L416604	u6875	m460	DAD	I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
L416594	u6875	m460	DAD	We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
L416593	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's getting there.
L416592	u6875	m460	DAD	You got your room straightened out yet?
L416865	u6881	m460	MOM	I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
L416864	u6875	m460	DAD	Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
L416863	u6881	m460	MOM	He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
L416747	u6881	m460	MOM	Ken!
L416746	u6875	m460	DAD	Come back here!
L416739	u6875	m460	DAD	What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
L416738	u6881	m460	MOM	Oh, please...
L416737	u6875	m460	DAD	Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
L416736	u6881	m460	MOM	I wasn't sure, Ken...
L416735	u6875	m460	DAD	Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
L417039	u6876	m460	FREDDY	He'll die with me!
L417038	u6880	m460	LISA	He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
L417037	u6876	m460	FREDDY	I'll kill you now.
L417036	u6876	m460	FREDDY	He's dead, you bitch.
L417035	u6880	m460	LISA	I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
L417033	u6876	m460	FREDDY	Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
L417032	u6880	m460	LISA	I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
L417029	u6880	m460	LISA	I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
L417028	u6876	m460	FREDDY	There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
L417027	u6880	m460	LISA	Where's Jesse?
L417026	u6876	m460	FREDDY	Wanna join your little friend?
L417024	u6876	m460	FREDDY	Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
L417023	u6880	m460	LISA	Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
L417000	u6876	m460	FREDDY	I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
L416999	u6880	m460	LISA	Jesse, help!
L416962	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's happening again.
L416961	u6877	m460	GRADY	What?
L416950	u6878	m460	JESSE	Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
L416949	u6877	m460	GRADY	Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
L416948	u6878	m460	JESSE	No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
L416947	u6877	m460	GRADY	I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
L416946	u6878	m460	JESSE	Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
L416945	u6877	m460	GRADY	The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
L416944	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
L416943	u6877	m460	GRADY	You're fucked in the head.
L416937	u6878	m460	JESSE	Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
L416936	u6877	m460	GRADY	Are you nuts or something?
L416935	u6878	m460	JESSE	You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
L416934	u6877	m460	GRADY	What are you doing here?
L416933	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm sorry...
L416932	u6877	m460	GRADY	Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
L416893	u6878	m460	JESSE	Shut up, Grady.
L416892	u6877	m460	GRADY	You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
L416879	u6877	m460	GRADY	He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
L416878	u6878	m460	JESSE	Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
L416797	u6877	m460	GRADY	Only the wet ones.
L416796	u6878	m460	JESSE	You remember your dreams, Grady?
L416795	u6878	m460	JESSE	Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
L416794	u6877	m460	GRADY	Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
L416793	u6878	m460	JESSE	Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
L416792	u6877	m460	GRADY	No shit.
L416791	u6878	m460	JESSE	My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
L416790	u6877	m460	GRADY	Who told you to choke up that way?
L416789	u6878	m460	JESSE	It was okay.
L416788	u6877	m460	GRADY	You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
L416654	u6877	m460	GRADY	They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
L416653	u6878	m460	JESSE	What the hell are you talking about?
L416652	u6877	m460	GRADY	Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
L416651	u6878	m460	JESSE	Yeah, why?
L416650	u6877	m460	GRADY	Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
L416649	u6878	m460	JESSE	Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
L416648	u6877	m460	GRADY	So, you live around here.
L416646	u6877	m460	GRADY	Naw. Just killing time.
L416645	u6878	m460	JESSE	You got a problem with me, Grady?
L416644	u6877	m460	GRADY	She giving you any carfare for the ride?
L416643	u6878	m460	JESSE	She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
L416642	u6877	m460	GRADY	You two got a thing going, or what?
L416641	u6878	m460	JESSE	What about it?
L416640	u6877	m460	GRADY	So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
L416639	u6878	m460	JESSE	Get outa here.
L416638	u6877	m460	GRADY	Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
L416637	u6878	m460	JESSE	How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
L417044	u6880	m460	LISA	We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
L417043	u6878	m460	JESSE	What's so funny?
L417042	u6880	m460	LISA	Hi.
L417041	u6878	m460	JESSE	Hi.
L416990	u6878	m460	JESSE	I can't!
L416989	u6880	m460	LISA	You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
L416975	u6880	m460	LISA	No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
L416974	u6878	m460	JESSE	Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
L416973	u6880	m460	LISA	Who?  Who's doing this to you?
L416972	u6878	m460	JESSE	he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
L416971	u6880	m460	LISA	Who, Jesse?
L416970	u6878	m460	JESSE	I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
L416969	u6880	m460	LISA	Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
L416968	u6878	m460	JESSE	I killed him!  I killed him!
L416967	u6880	m460	LISA	Jesse, God - what happened?
L416925	u6880	m460	LISA	We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
L416924	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
L416922	u6878	m460	JESSE	What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
L416921	u6880	m460	LISA	You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
L416920	u6878	m460	JESSE	Will you leave me alone?  Please.
L416919	u6880	m460	LISA	Why won't you talk to me?
L416918	u6878	m460	JESSE	I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
L416891	u6878	m460	JESSE	There's nothing to figure out.
L416890	u6880	m460	LISA	I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
L416889	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm not hungry.
L416888	u6880	m460	LISA	You should eat something - you'll feel better.
L416874	u6878	m460	JESSE	My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
L416873	u6880	m460	LISA	You want to talk about it?
L416872	u6878	m460	JESSE	yeah, I had a bad night.
L416871	u6880	m460	LISA	you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
L416870	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
L416869	u6880	m460	LISA	Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
L416848	u6880	m460	LISA	Oh, Jesse...
L416847	u6878	m460	JESSE	It's gone now.
L416846	u6878	m460	JESSE	I don't know - a sharp pain.
L416845	u6880	m460	LISA	What is it?
L416844	u6878	m460	JESSE	Whoa!
L416843	u6880	m460	LISA	What is it - What's wrong?
L416842	u6880	m460	LISA	Ghostbusters are fearless.
L416841	u6878	m460	JESSE	Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
L416840	u6880	m460	LISA	Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
L416839	u6878	m460	JESSE	Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
L416838	u6880	m460	LISA	Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
L416837	u6878	m460	JESSE	Yeah?
L416835	u6880	m460	LISA	I'll get over it.
L416834	u6878	m460	JESSE	About not finding any bogey men?
L416833	u6880	m460	LISA	About what?
L416832	u6878	m460	JESSE	Disappointed?
L416831	u6878	m460	JESSE	Uh-uh.  Wait...
L416830	u6880	m460	LISA	Anything?
L416829	u6880	m460	LISA	Shhh.  Just concentrate.
L416828	u6878	m460	JESSE	I feel like a jerk.
L416827	u6880	m460	LISA	I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
L416826	u6878	m460	JESSE	Well, what am I supposed to do?
L416825	u6880	m460	LISA	C'mon, cut it out.
L416824	u6878	m460	JESSE	Any ghosts in here?
L416823	u6880	m460	LISA	I thought you might be able to make a connection.
L416822	u6878	m460	JESSE	What do you mean?
L416821	u6880	m460	LISA	So, you feeling anything?
L416817	u6878	m460	JESSE	What's this?
L416816	u6880	m460	LISA	Here.
L416815	u6880	m460	LISA	Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
L416814	u6878	m460	JESSE	What is this place?
L416813	u6880	m460	LISA	It's a surprise.
L416812	u6878	m460	JESSE	I don't know.  Where are we going?
L416811	u6880	m460	LISA	"What about ""essential energy"" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?"
L416810	u6880	m460	LISA	Make a left at this corner.
L416809	u6878	m460	JESSE	I don't know - into the air I suppose.
L416808	u6880	m460	LISA	And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
L416807	u6878	m460	JESSE	Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
L416806	u6880	m460	LISA	Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
L416805	u6880	m460	LISA	You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
L416804	u6878	m460	JESSE	Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
L416803	u6880	m460	LISA	"At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to ""the other world"" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals."
L416801	u6880	m460	LISA	Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
L416800	u6878	m460	JESSE	What's all this.
L416799	u6880	m460	LISA	I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
L416798	u6878	m460	JESSE	Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
L416773	u6880	m460	LISA	I don't know.
L416772	u6878	m460	JESSE	No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
L416770	u6878	m460	JESSE	Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
L416769	u6880	m460	LISA	Who?
L416768	u6878	m460	JESSE	That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
L416766	u6878	m460	JESSE	Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
L416765	u6880	m460	LISA	This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
L416725	u6880	m460	LISA	World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
L416724	u6878	m460	JESSE	Are you sure?
L416718	u6878	m460	JESSE	Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
L416717	u6880	m460	LISA	Are you okay.
L416716	u6880	m460	LISA	Wow...
L416715	u6878	m460	JESSE	Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!
L416709	u6878	m460	JESSE	That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
L416708	u6880	m460	LISA	March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love.
L416707	u6878	m460	JESSE	Traumas of a ten-year old.
L416706	u6880	m460	LISA	I think it's sad...
L416704	u6880	m460	LISA	Uh-uh.  Before my time.
L416703	u6878	m460	JESSE	You know her?
L416698	u6878	m460	JESSE	Yeah?
L416697	u6880	m460	LISA	I figured you might like some help.
L416696	u6880	m460	LISA	I know.
L416695	u6878	m460	JESSE	No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
L416664	u6878	m460	JESSE	Yeah.
L416663	u6880	m460	LISA	You mean a shithead.
L416662	u6878	m460	JESSE	Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
L416661	u6880	m460	LISA	You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
L416660	u6880	m460	LISA	Let me look at your eye...
L416659	u6878	m460	JESSE	Yeah, yeah, sure.
L416658	u6880	m460	LISA	You okay?
L416657	u6880	m460	LISA	That's okay, I wanted to.
L416656	u6878	m460	JESSE	Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
L416618	u6878	m460	JESSE	Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
L416617	u6880	m460	LISA	Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
L416616	u6878	m460	JESSE	Ah, nothing.
L416615	u6880	m460	LISA	How come?
L416614	u6878	m460	JESSE	your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
L416907	u6878	m460	JESSE	Fine.
L416906	u6881	m460	MOM	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
L416905	u6878	m460	JESSE	Morning.
L416862	u6878	m460	JESSE	I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
L416861	u6881	m460	MOM	Jesse, please, let's talk about this!

L416691	u6880	m460	LISA	Okay...thanks.
L416690	u6882	m460	MRS. POLETTI	There's a Jesse on the phone.
L417158	u6883	m461	ELAINE	First door up the stairs.
L417157	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
L417156	u6883	m461	ELAINE	The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
L417155	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'll need to take her things.
L417154	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
L417153	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'm sure you would.
L417152	u6883	m461	ELAINE	I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
L417151	u6889	m461	NANCY	Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
L417150	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
L417149	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'm serious.
L417148	u6883	m461	ELAINE	They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
L417147	u6889	m461	NANCY	Did she always have nightmares?
L417146	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
L417145	u6889	m461	NANCY	Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
L417558	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
L417557	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Can't it wait till morning?
L417556	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
L417553	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I had such an awful dream.
L417552	u6883	m461	ELAINE	What?
L417550	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
L417549	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I thought I'd wait for you.
L417548	u6883	m461	ELAINE	What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
L417547	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Mom?
L417546	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
L417059	u6883	m461	ELAINE	That's right.  I don't.
L417058	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	And you don't want to keep him waiting.
L417054	u6883	m461	ELAINE	I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
L417053	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	He's full of shit.
L417052	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
L417051	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
L417050	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
L417049	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I thought I'd wait for you.
L417048	u6883	m461	ELAINE	"Don't ""hi Mom"" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!"
L417047	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Hi Mom.
L417046	u6883	m461	ELAINE	Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
L417082	u6890	m461	NEIL	Don't hold your breath.
L417081	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
L417080	u6890	m461	NEIL	They're healing up nicely.
L417079	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
L417078	u6890	m461	NEIL	How's your hand?
L417077	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	Morning, Doctor Goldman.
L417076	u6890	m461	NEIL	Good morning, Jennifer.
L417325	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	Deal.  Thanks.
L417324	u6888	m461	MAX	If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
L417323	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
L417322	u6888	m461	MAX	Jennifer --
L417321	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	I gotta stay up, Max.
L417320	u6888	m461	MAX	If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
L417319	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	Wait and see.
L417318	u6888	m461	MAX	Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
L417317	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	Research.
L417316	u6888	m461	MAX	I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
L417315	u6884	m461	JENNIFER	Watching TV.
L417314	u6888	m461	MAX	Girl, what are you doing?
L417587	u6885	m461	KINCAID	YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
L417586	u6889	m461	NANCY	Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
L417540	u6885	m461	KINCAID	No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
L417539	u6889	m461	NANCY	You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
L417377	u6889	m461	NANCY	Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
L417376	u6885	m461	KINCAID	So what do we do about this creep?
L417368	u6889	m461	NANCY	He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
L417367	u6885	m461	KINCAID	Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
L417366	u6889	m461	NANCY	I know who's trying to kill you.
L417262	u6889	m461	NANCY	No, she's right.
L417261	u6885	m461	KINCAID	Horseshit.
L417646	u6890	m461	NEIL	Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
L417645	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Do you still...see each other?
L417644	u6890	m461	NEIL	It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
L417643	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	To old friends.
L417642	u6890	m461	NEIL	To old friends.  And your new dreams.
L417641	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
L417640	u6890	m461	NEIL	The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
L417639	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
L417638	u6890	m461	NEIL	I'm glad things have worked out for you.
L417415	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	He's close...
L417414	u6890	m461	NEIL	What's happening?
L417634	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
L417633	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
L417621	u6889	m461	NANCY	I think so.
L417620	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Are you okay?
L417611	u6889	m461	NANCY	Let's try this way.
L417610	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
L417609	u6889	m461	NANCY	Kristen, can you pull us out?
L417596	u6889	m461	NANCY	He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
L417595	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Nancy!
L417579	u6889	m461	NANCY	I don't know.
L417578	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	What's that?
L417542	u6889	m461	NANCY	How do we find him, Kristen?
L417541	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
L417417	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	He's heavy in the halls...
L417416	u6889	m461	NANCY	Freddy?
L417383	u6889	m461	NANCY	You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
L417382	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	That was different.
L417381	u6889	m461	NANCY	You did it the other night.
L417380	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
L417329	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Yeah, but I was really not good.
L417328	u6889	m461	NANCY	We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
L417327	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
L417326	u6889	m461	NANCY	You like gymnastics?
L417297	u6889	m461	NANCY	Sure.
L417296	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
L417179	u6889	m461	NANCY	He's real.
L417178	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
L417177	u6889	m461	NANCY	It's an amazing gift.
L417176	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
L417175	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
L417174	u6889	m461	NANCY	Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
L417173	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
L417172	u6889	m461	NANCY	I used to live in this house.
L417164	u6886	m461	KRISTEN	I -- I think so!
L417163	u6889	m461	NANCY	You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
L417313	u6893	m461	TARYN	Fuck off.
L417312	u6887	m461	LORENZO	Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
L417311	u6893	m461	TARYN	Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
L417310	u6887	m461	LORENZO	Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
L417309	u6893	m461	TARYN	Those are ancient history.
L417308	u6887	m461	LORENZO	What are these, beauty marks?
L417307	u6893	m461	TARYN	I don't do that shit.
L417306	u6887	m461	LORENZO	The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
L417305	u6893	m461	TARYN	What?
L417304	u6887	m461	LORENZO	So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
L417303	u6893	m461	TARYN	So?
L417302	u6887	m461	LORENZO	Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
L417301	u6893	m461	TARYN	Can't be good news coming from you.
L417300	u6887	m461	LORENZO	Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
L417510	u6889	m461	NANCY	Thank you.
L417509	u6888	m461	MAX	You got five minutes.
L417508	u6889	m461	NANCY	It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
L417507	u6888	m461	MAX	I don't know...
L417504	u6889	m461	NANCY	But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
L417503	u6888	m461	MAX	Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
L417299	u6889	m461	NANCY	Thanks, Max.
L417298	u6888	m461	MAX	You need me, I'll be here all night.
L417295	u6888	m461	MAX	Restless.  Very restless.
L417294	u6889	m461	NANCY	I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
L417293	u6888	m461	MAX	Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
L417171	u6888	m461	MAX	She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
L417170	u6889	m461	NANCY	Max, where's Kristen?
L417130	u6889	m461	NANCY	Why is that?
L417129	u6888	m461	MAX	This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
L417128	u6888	m461	MAX	I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
L417127	u6889	m461	NANCY	A little basic, but nice.
L417126	u6888	m461	MAX	The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
L417075	u6888	m461	MAX	Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
L417074	u6890	m461	NEIL	It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
L417073	u6888	m461	MAX	Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
L417072	u6890	m461	NEIL	Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
L417071	u6888	m461	MAX	Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
L417070	u6890	m461	NEIL	Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
L417626	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
L417625	u6889	m461	NANCY	Crossed over?
L417623	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Nancy...
L417622	u6889	m461	NANCY	It's over.  It's over.
L417480	u6889	m461	NANCY	People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
L417479	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
L417478	u6889	m461	NANCY	I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
L417475	u6889	m461	NANCY	You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
L417474	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
L417473	u6889	m461	NANCY	That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
L417472	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
L417471	u6889	m461	NANCY	It's been a long time.
L417470	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
L417493	u6890	m461	NEIL	Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
L417492	u6889	m461	NANCY	Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
L417487	u6889	m461	NANCY	No...
L417486	u6890	m461	NEIL	Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
L417482	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
L417481	u6890	m461	NEIL	Nancy...
L417464	u6889	m461	NANCY	There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
L417463	u6890	m461	NEIL	Who would know where they were hidden?
L417462	u6889	m461	NANCY	They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
L417461	u6890	m461	NEIL	The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
L417460	u6889	m461	NANCY	All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
L417459	u6890	m461	NEIL	I've heard crazier things this week.
L417458	u6889	m461	NANCY	Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
L417457	u6890	m461	NEIL	Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
L417456	u6889	m461	NANCY	Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
L417455	u6890	m461	NEIL	You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
L417437	u6890	m461	NEIL	There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
L417436	u6889	m461	NANCY	What are we going to do?
L417408	u6890	m461	NEIL	Anything?
L417407	u6889	m461	NANCY	Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
L417400	u6890	m461	NEIL	This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
L417399	u6889	m461	NANCY	We made it.  Neil, we made it!
L417391	u6890	m461	NEIL	Everybody take five.
L417390	u6889	m461	NANCY	We can try again.
L417388	u6890	m461	NEIL	Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
L417387	u6889	m461	NANCY	Take us there, Kristen.
L417386	u6890	m461	NEIL	Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
L417385	u6889	m461	NANCY	Remember -- open mind.
L417384	u6890	m461	NEIL	You sound like Peter Pan.
L417360	u6890	m461	NEIL	I can do that.
L417359	u6889	m461	NANCY	Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
L417358	u6890	m461	NEIL	Try me.
L417357	u6889	m461	NANCY	The truth.
L417356	u6890	m461	NEIL	For what?
L417355	u6889	m461	NANCY	Then maybe you're ready.
L417354	u6890	m461	NEIL	I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
L417353	u6889	m461	NANCY	Stop blaming yourself.
L417351	u6889	m461	NANCY	C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
L417350	u6890	m461	NEIL	Doesn't matter.
L417349	u6889	m461	NANCY	To who?
L417291	u6890	m461	NEIL	We're gonna try.
L417290	u6889	m461	NANCY	Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
L417289	u6890	m461	NEIL	I can't believe I just did that.
L417244	u6890	m461	NEIL	I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
L417243	u6889	m461	NANCY	Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
L417242	u6890	m461	NEIL	So do I.
L417241	u6889	m461	NANCY	I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
L417240	u6890	m461	NEIL	Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
L417239	u6889	m461	NANCY	Just until we get things under control.
L417238	u6890	m461	NEIL	You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
L417237	u6889	m461	NANCY	That's right.
L417236	u6890	m461	NEIL	With Hypnocyl?
L417235	u6889	m461	NANCY	All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
L417234	u6890	m461	NEIL	The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
L417233	u6889	m461	NANCY	That's what I know.
L417232	u6890	m461	NEIL	That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
L417231	u6889	m461	NANCY	What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
L417230	u6890	m461	NEIL	Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
L417229	u6889	m461	NANCY	I'm serious.
L417228	u6890	m461	NEIL	I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
L417227	u6889	m461	NANCY	It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
L417226	u6890	m461	NEIL	Sounds like a rough time.
L417225	u6889	m461	NANCY	My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
L417224	u6890	m461	NEIL	Sorry.
L417223	u6889	m461	NANCY	My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
L417222	u6890	m461	NEIL	Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
L417221	u6889	m461	NANCY	Must have opened while I was away at school.
L417220	u6890	m461	NEIL	Never been here before?
L417219	u6889	m461	NANCY	This is nice.
L417202	u6889	m461	NANCY	All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
L417201	u6890	m461	NEIL	Yes, tell us, Nancy.
L417169	u6890	m461	NEIL	Well, we've got --
L417168	u6889	m461	NANCY	Didn't get much sleep.
L417167	u6890	m461	NEIL	You're late.
L417125	u6889	m461	NANCY	Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
L417124	u6890	m461	NEIL	Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
L417123	u6889	m461	NANCY	Call me Nancy.
L417122	u6890	m461	NEIL	Ms. Thompson.
L417120	u6890	m461	NEIL	Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
L417119	u6889	m461	NANCY	Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
L417118	u6890	m461	NEIL	So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
L417117	u6889	m461	NANCY	I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
L417116	u6890	m461	NEIL	What's that supposed to mean?
L417115	u6889	m461	NANCY	I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
L417114	u6890	m461	NEIL	Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
L417113	u6889	m461	NANCY	Oh God.
L417112	u6890	m461	NEIL	We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
L417111	u6889	m461	NANCY	Anything?
L417110	u6890	m461	NEIL	"Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a ""boogeyman"" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep."
L417109	u6889	m461	NANCY	But nightmares are the common thread?
L417108	u6890	m461	NEIL	You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
L417107	u6889	m461	NANCY	Tell me about the kids.
L417522	u6889	m461	NANCY	We can't get to her.  I've tried.
L417521	u6893	m461	TARYN	What about Kristen?
L417520	u6889	m461	NANCY	Okay, straight talk only in here.
L417512	u6889	m461	NANCY	Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
L417511	u6893	m461	TARYN	What'd you do, take the scenic route?
L417370	u6889	m461	NANCY	Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
L417369	u6893	m461	TARYN	Who is he?
L417192	u6893	m461	TARYN	Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
L417191	u6889	m461	NANCY	Your dreams?
L417190	u6893	m461	TARYN	I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
L417282	u6889	m461	NANCY	Neil, please --
L417281	u6892	m461	SIMMS	That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
L417280	u6889	m461	NANCY	You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
L417279	u6892	m461	SIMMS	We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
L417198	u6892	m461	SIMMS	The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
L417197	u6889	m461	NANCY	And what are they?
L417196	u6892	m461	SIMMS	And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
L417605	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	No.  We're alone.
L417604	u6890	m461	NEIL	Somebody else is out here.
L417603	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	Listen.
L417602	u6890	m461	NEIL	What?
L417601	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	What was that?
L417535	u6890	m461	NEIL	You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
L417534	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	What are you talking about?
L417533	u6890	m461	NEIL	We've got work to do.
L417517	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	They used to keep a spare key.
L417516	u6890	m461	NEIL	How do we get in?
L417515	u6894	m461	THOMPSON	In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
L417450	u6891	m461	NUN	You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
L417449	u6890	m461	NEIL	You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
L417448	u6891	m461	NUN	The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
L417447	u6890	m461	NEIL	Freddy.
L417446	u6891	m461	NUN	That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
L417445	u6890	m461	NEIL	My God.
L417444	u6891	m461	NUN	A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
L417443	u6890	m461	NEIL	The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
L417442	u6891	m461	NUN	Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
L417441	u6890	m461	NEIL	This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
L417346	u6890	m461	NEIL	I beg your pardon?
L417345	u6891	m461	NUN	Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
L417344	u6890	m461	NEIL	I could've saved them.
L417343	u6891	m461	NUN	I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
L417342	u6890	m461	NEIL	You do volunteer work at the hospital?
L417341	u6891	m461	NUN	Mary Helena.
L417340	u6890	m461	NEIL	There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
L417339	u6891	m461	NUN	A sad choice.
L417338	u6890	m461	NEIL	Science...I suppose.
L417435	u6892	m461	SIMMS	Of course.
L417434	u6890	m461	NEIL	For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
L417433	u6892	m461	SIMMS	I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
L417287	u6890	m461	NEIL	I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
L417286	u6892	m461	SIMMS	I won't allow it.
L417285	u6890	m461	NEIL	Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
L417284	u6892	m461	SIMMS	I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
L417283	u6890	m461	NEIL	Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
L417273	u6892	m461	SIMMS	There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
L417272	u6890	m461	NEIL	That's enough, Kincaid.
L417181	u6892	m461	SIMMS	Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
L417180	u6890	m461	NEIL	Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
L417093	u6890	m461	NEIL	Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
L417092	u6892	m461	SIMMS	She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
L417091	u6890	m461	NEIL	Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
L417090	u6892	m461	SIMMS	What did you think?
L417087	u6890	m461	NEIL	Don't worry, it won't come to that.
L417086	u6892	m461	SIMMS	If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
L417085	u6890	m461	NEIL	Cooling down.
L417084	u6892	m461	SIMMS	How is he?
L417526	u6893	m461	TARYN	Me too.
L417525	u6895	m461	WILL	I'm in.
L417395	u6893	m461	TARYN	Where...here?
L417394	u6895	m461	WILL	We're here.
L417375	u6893	m461	TARYN	"Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  ""Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."""
L417374	u6895	m461	WILL	Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
L417372	u6893	m461	TARYN	Yeah?  What did we ever do?
L417371	u6895	m461	WILL	Why is he after us?
L417211	u6893	m461	TARYN	I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
L417210	u6895	m461	WILL	Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
L417209	u6893	m461	TARYN	In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
L417208	u6895	m461	WILL	C'mon.
L417207	u6893	m461	TARYN	This is stupid.
L417206	u6895	m461	WILL	Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
L417205	u6893	m461	TARYN	Uh, fourteen.
L417204	u6895	m461	WILL	Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
L417184	u6893	m461	TARYN	Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
L417183	u6895	m461	WILL	I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
L432327	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I do not joke in my proposal.
L432326	u6968	m466	BOB	Leave her alone, I tell you!
L432325	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
L432324	u6968	m466	BOB	If I could get my hands on you...
L432323	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
L432322	u6968	m466	BOB	Leave her alone, you fiend!
L432391	u6968	m466	BOB	Of course I do.
L432390	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	You love me then?
L432389	u6968	m466	BOB	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
L432388	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
L432339	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Maybe so.
L432338	u6968	m466	BOB	<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
L432337	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
L432336	u6968	m466	BOB	All right.  Put it on heavy.
L432335	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
L432334	u6968	m466	BOB	I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
L432333	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What can we do against them?
L432332	u6968	m466	BOB	I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
L432311	u6968	m466	BOB	...And I thought you loved me.
L432310	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
L432309	u6968	m466	BOB	That sudden?
L432308	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I should hope not.  I hate you!
L432307	u6968	m466	BOB	They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
L432306	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
L432305	u6968	m466	BOB	You're talking nonsense.
L432304	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Yes I feel it in my bones.
L432303	u6968	m466	BOB	You do?
L432302	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
L432301	u6968	m466	BOB	Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
L432300	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
L432299	u6968	m466	BOB	My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
L432298	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Nothing is worth your life.
L432297	u6968	m466	BOB	I am--It's our only chance.
L432296	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Be careful!
L432295	u6968	m466	BOB	The ropes are coming loose.
L432237	u6968	m466	BOB	Whatever you do, don't do that.
L432236	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm afraid I'll faint.
L432235	u6968	m466	BOB	Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
L432234	u6968	m466	BOB	I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
L432233	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What can we do?
L432232	u6968	m466	BOB	Don't let them hear you.
L432231	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Those creatures..!
L432230	u6968	m466	BOB	You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
L432229	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm so frightened.
L432207	u6968	m466	BOB	Be careful!--They'll see you.
L432206	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Look!
L432204	u6968	m466	BOB	I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
L432203	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What do you mean?
L432202	u6968	m466	BOB	I'm not sure...
L432201	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Can't we get out of here?
L432200	u6968	m466	BOB	It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
L432199	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Could it be some kind of college initiation?
L432198	u6968	m466	BOB	Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
L432197	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
L432196	u6968	m466	BOB	Not dead?  In a cemetery?
L432195	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
L432194	u6968	m466	BOB	All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
L432193	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
L432192	u6968	m466	BOB	Something's making that music.
L432191	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
L432190	u6968	m466	BOB	That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
L432189	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Then..then what's that music?
L432188	u6968	m466	BOB	Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
L432187	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	It frightens me.
L432186	u6968	m466	BOB	In there.
L432185	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Where?
L432184	u6968	m466	BOB	Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
L432171	u6968	m466	BOB	Okay.
L432170	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
L432169	u6968	m466	BOB	There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
L432168	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
L432167	u6968	m466	BOB	All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
L432166	u6968	m466	BOB	Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
L432165	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	That's life.  My kisses are alive.
L432164	u6968	m466	BOB	Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
L432162	u6968	m466	BOB	Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
L432161	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
L432160	u6968	m466	BOB	Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
L432159	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
L432158	u6968	m466	BOB	You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
L432157	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	But does it have to be in a cemetery?
L432156	u6968	m466	BOB	No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
L432155	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
L432376	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
L432375	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
L432374	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You better hope there is.
L432373	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Is there time?
L432372	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You may take her now.
L432371	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	You mean...!
L432370	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Your pleasures of course!
L432369	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	For what!?!
L432368	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	The time...is short.
L432367	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
L432366	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
L432365	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Oh, if there is only time!
L432364	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
L432363	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
L432362	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Then cancel my order.
L432361	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
L432360	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I will decide the conclusion.
L432359	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
L432356	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Well then let us proceed.
L432355	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	There are others.
L432354	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
L432353	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	I understand, Master
L432352	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
L432351	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	I would have time for my own pleasures!
L432350	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
L432349	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
L432348	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, there is yet time.
L432347	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	The moon is almost gone!
L432346	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
L432345	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	When!?
L432344	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, she will be yours.
L432343	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Well?
L432329	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
L432328	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
L432291	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
L432290	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	It would seem so, Master
L432289	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
L432288	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
L432287	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Yes, yes yes I know all that.
L432262	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	As you wish, Master
L432261	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
L432260	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
L432251	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	It would seem so, Master.
L432250	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
L432249	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
L432248	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	She was?
L432246	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Her dance has pleased me.
L432245	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
L432244	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
L432243	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
L432242	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	What kind of symbol?
L432241	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	A symbol, Master.
L432240	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	...And what is this?
L432223	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	Tie them that they may watch.
L432222	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	A situation easily remedied.
L432221	u6970	m466	PRINCESS OF DARKNESS	But they are not yet one of us.
L432294	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Yes, sir, Master.
L432293	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
L432292	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
L432284	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
L432283	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Then it is some service you desire of us.
L432282	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Aaaahhhh.
L432281	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
L432280	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
L432279	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Then why do you shake so?
L432278	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	We don't know of anything, Master...
L432277	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You know better than that.
L432276	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
L432218	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
L432217	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Live ones where only the dead should be?
L432216	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Yes, Master.
L432215	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	They are live ones?
L432331	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
L432330	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	No. No! No!
L432321	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
L432320	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
L432319	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
L432318	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
L432183	u6971	m466	SHIRLEY	I'm so frightened.
L432182	u6969	m466	CRISWELL	Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
L432342	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Without the snake, of course.
L432341	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
L432340	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	I could make her another Cleopatra...
L432271	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
L432270	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aannnnaahhnn.
L432269	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
L432268	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aannnnaahhnn.
L432267	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
L432266	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
L432265	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	What do you suppose for?
L432264	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
L432263	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	He wants us.
L432259	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaarrrgggaahh.
L432258	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
L432257	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
L432256	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
L432255	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
L432254	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
L432253	u6973	m466	THE WOLF MAN	Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
L432252	u6972	m466	THE MUMMY	I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
L439323	u7014	m469	BARNEY	It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
L439322	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
L439309	u7014	m469	BARNEY	I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
L439308	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	I'm not telling.
L439307	u7014	m469	BARNEY	What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy?five? Eighty?
L439300	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
L439299	u7014	m469	BARNEY	Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
L439298	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	Peggy Sue!
L439297	u7014	m469	BARNEY	Hello, Lilla!
L439342	u7014	m469	BARNEY	It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
L439341	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Do you have to wear that hat?
L439333	u7014	m469	BARNEY	The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
L439332	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
L439331	u7014	m469	BARNEY	I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
L439330	u7014	m469	BARNEY	Stag movies. Smokers.
L439329	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
L439327	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Good?bye, Grandma.
L439326	u7014	m469	BARNEY	Let's go.
L439321	u7014	m469	BARNEY	I'd take better care of my teeth.
L439320	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
L439319	u7014	m469	BARNEY	It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
L439318	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
L439317	u7014	m469	BARNEY	It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
L439312	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
L439311	u7014	m469	BARNEY	Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
L439310	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Do you believe in all of that?
L438434	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
L438433	u7015	m469	BETH	Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
L438432	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
L438431	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
L438430	u7015	m469	BETH	Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
L438429	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
L438428	u7015	m469	BETH	Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
L438427	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
L438426	u7015	m469	BETH	Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
L438425	u7025	m469	PEGGY	But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
L438413	u7015	m469	BETH	It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
L438412	u7025	m469	PEGGY	How do you like my hair?
L438411	u7015	m469	BETH	r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
L438410	u7025	m469	PEGGY	This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
L438409	u7015	m469	BETH	Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
L439263	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
L439262	u7016	m469	CAROL	What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
L439261	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Welcome to the singles' scene.
L439260	u7016	m469	CAROL	After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
L439259	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What happened?
L439258	u7016	m469	CAROL	It's that jerk Walter.
L439257	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What's the matter?
L439093	u7016	m469	CAROL	Aren't we a little old for that?
L439092	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
L439084	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That loud?mouthed little bitch~
L439083	u7016	m469	CAROL	I bet Dolores told Charlie.
L439080	u7016	m469	CAROL	Come on. What's with you and Michael?
L439079	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
L439078	u7016	m469	CAROL	Just what you underlined.
L439077	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
L439071	u7025	m469	PEGGY	On what?
L439070	u7016	m469	CAROL	All right. What's the scoop?
L438880	u7025	m469	PEGGY	He does?
L438879	u7016	m469	CAROL	Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
L438878	u7025	m469	PEGGY	He is kind of cute, isn't he?
L438713	u7016	m469	CAROL	That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
L438712	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I don't get it.
L438577	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yes. Let's stay in touch.
L438576	u7016	m469	CAROL	I'll call you Later.
L438575	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
L438574	u7016	m469	CAROL	We're going to take you home.
L438573	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
L438572	u7016	m469	CAROL	Were taking you back to the nurse.
L438571	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Where is it?
L438553	u7016	m469	CAROL	Go on. You can do it.
L438552	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I can't. It's all too much.
L438551	u7016	m469	CAROL	They're waiting. Come on.
L438525	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Well, besides Charlie, of course.
L438524	u7016	m469	CAROL	The only one?
L438515	u7016	m469	CAROL	Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
L438514	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
L438475	u7016	m469	CAROL	Wouldn't we all.
L438474	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
L438473	u7016	m469	CAROL	After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
L438472	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
L438471	u7016	m469	CAROL	You should have left here years ago, like I did.
L438470	u7016	m469	CAROL	So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
L438469	u7025	m469	PEGGY	We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
L438468	u7016	m469	CAROL	You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
L438467	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
L438466	u7016	m469	CAROL	Welcome to the singles scene.
L438408	u7016	m469	CAROL	You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
L438407	u7025	m469	PEGGY	1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
L438405	u7016	m469	CAROL	Peggy Sue!
L438404	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Carol!
L439091	u7020	m469	MADDY	Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
L439090	u7016	m469	CAROL	Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
L439086	u7016	m469	CAROL	You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
L439085	u7020	m469	MADDY	Peggy Sue!
L439076	u7016	m469	CAROL	") Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that ""the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it"". Page eighty?six."
L439075	u7020	m469	MADDY	That's disgusting!
L439074	u7016	m469	CAROL	I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
L438875	u7020	m469	MADDY	Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
L438874	u7016	m469	CAROL	Charlie really has a great voice.
L438860	u7016	m469	CAROL	Why do guys do such stupid things?
L438859	u7020	m469	MADDY	Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
L438519	u7020	m469	MADDY	Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
L438518	u7016	m469	CAROL	Lucky lady. Hi.
L439412	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
L439411	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
L439410	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
L439409	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Then hold me.
L439408	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I'll never give up.
L439407	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
L439406	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Oh, God, Dion.
L439405	u7025	m469	PEGGY	"Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing ""I Wonder Why""."
L439404	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I'll just set it right here.
L439403	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
L439400	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
L439399	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What about Janet?
L439398	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
L439397	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
L439396	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
L439395	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
L439394	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I thought you were...for a while.
L439393	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie? Was I dead?
L439392	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
L439388	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm trying.
L439387	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Come back to me.
L439386	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
L439385	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	But I love you. I'll love you forever.
L439384	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I've got to go now.
L439383	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
L439382	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What the hell is that?
L439381	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
L439380	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
L439379	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I know.
L439378	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I love you.
L439374	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	It opens, too. Look inside.
L439373	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh, Charlie.
L439371	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Of course.
L439370	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Will you take me back to my grandparents?
L439368	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
L439367	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
L439366	u7025	m469	PEGGY	"You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, ""Peggy, you're scared."" Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless."
L439365	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What?
L439364	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
L439362	u7025	m469	PEGGY	How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
L439361	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
L439360	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Right here. Now sit down.
L439359	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Let me got! Where are you taking me?
L439357	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You're going to listen to me.
L439356	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
L439355	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
L439354	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
L439293	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
L439292	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Forget it, it'll never work.
L439255	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
L439254	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It means I care about you and what happens to you.
L439253	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Does this mean you like me again?
L439252	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
L439251	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Just take a look at it. 
L439250	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
L439249	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
L439248	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
L439247	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
L439246	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	That's real big of you.
L439245	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
L439244	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
L439243	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
L439242	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
L439241	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
L439240	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	How'd you know about that?
L439239	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
L439238	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
L439237	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
L439236	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
L439235	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
L439234	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What're you doing here?
L439129	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
L439128	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
L439127	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
L439126	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
L439125	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	But what has to be different?
L439124	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
L439123	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
L439122	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I just can't trust you anymore.
L439121	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
L439120	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
L439119	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
L439118	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
L439117	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
L439116	u7025	m469	PEGGY	And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
L439115	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
L439114	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
L439113	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	"Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did ""Book of Love ?? Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..."" I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?"
L439112	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
L439111	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
L439110	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Let's go down to the basement.
L439109	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What are you doing here?
L439108	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I have to talk to you..
L439107	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
L439040	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
L439039	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What am I going to do with you?
L439038	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
L439037	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Why?
L439036	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
L439035	u7025	m469	PEGGY	But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
L439034	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
L439033	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie. About last nights..
L439032	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Nothing.. Selling is selling.
L439031	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What do you know about classical music?
L438915	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Save it.
L438914	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm sorry Charlie.
L438913	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
L438912	u7025	m469	PEGGY	This is a mistake. We better forget it.
L438910	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
L438909	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
L438908	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Who?
L438907	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
L438906	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
L438905	u7025	m469	PEGGY	A lot's happened since last weekend.
L438904	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
L438903	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie, let's make love.
L438902	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
L438901	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You really love me, don't you?
L438900	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
L438899	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
L438896	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
L438895	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You're pretty charming when you want to be.
L438894	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
L438892	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Come on, let's dance.
L438891	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
L438890	u7025	m469	PEGGY	He's trying.
L438889	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
L438888	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
L438841	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
L438840	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
L438839	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie, how are you?
L438838	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Is this slow enough for you?
L438837	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Right. I promised my mother.
L438836	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
L438835	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
L438834	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Great, isn't it?
L438833	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Where did you get that sweater?
L438743	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Good.
L438742	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Yeah. Like that.
L438741	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Rejected, worthless, miserable.
L438740	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
L438739	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I thought it had a lot of merit.
L438738	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
L438737	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Thanks.
L438736	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Looking good out there.
L438683	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Would I?!! Why I oughta...
L438682	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Would you?
L438681	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Want me to drive you home later?
L438679	u7025	m469	PEGGY	They'll learn to live with it.
L438678	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
L438677	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Why wait?
L438676	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
L438675	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
L438674	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Maybe I blocked it out.
L438673	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
L438672	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Refresh my memory.
L438671	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
L438670	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh yeah?
L438669	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
L438668	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I call this the staccato. 
L438667	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You drive like a maniac!
L438666	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
L438665	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
L438663	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Pretty strange.
L438662	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	How do you feel?
L438558	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
L438557	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie! Am I dead?
L438556	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
L438392	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I'm not going.
L438391	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
L438390	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
L438389	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I know. Put Scott through college.
L438388	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
L438387	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
L438386	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	You got a Tab?
L438384	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
L438383	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
L438382	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
L438381	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
L438380	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
L438379	u7025	m469	PEGGY	There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
L438369	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	And nothing will ever change that.
L438368	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
L438367	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	But you love me don't you?
L438366	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
L438365	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
L438364	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
L438363	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Charlie...
L438362	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	We're here on the sofa bed...
L438361	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Don't say that...
L438360	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	And we're here on the couch...
L438832	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Of course.
L438831	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
L438830	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	What would that be, sir?
L438829	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
L438821	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Yes, sir. Trust is a two?way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
L438820	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
L438819	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
L438817	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
L438816	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Yes, sir.
L438813	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
L438812	u7017	m469	CHARLIE	Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
L438811	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Hello, Charlie.
L439273	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Have a nice day.
L439272	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Take a long walk on a short pier.
L439271	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I beg your pardon?
L439270	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
L439269	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
L438886	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Touchy, touchy!
L438885	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Are you for real?
L438884	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
L438883	u7018	m469	DOLORES	God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
L438882	u7025	m469	PEGGY	First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
L438881	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
L438689	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Test?
L438688	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Did you study for the test?
L438939	u7018	m469	DOLORES	First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
L438938	u7028	m469	TERRY	That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
L438937	u7018	m469	DOLORES	There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
L438936	u7028	m469	TERRY	What, why?
L438935	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Terry! Slow down.
L438934	u7028	m469	TERRY	Okay.
L438933	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Terry, slow down.
L438898	u7028	m469	TERRY	What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
L438897	u7018	m469	DOLORES	Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
L439325	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
L439324	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
L439316	u7025	m469	PEGGY	My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
L439315	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
L439314	u7025	m469	PEGGY	But I'm remembering the future.
L439313	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
L439306	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
L439305	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I wish she hadn't.
L439304	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
L439302	u7019	m469	ELIZABETH	That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
L439301	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
L439089	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
L439088	u7020	m469	MADDY	But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
L439087	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
L439082	u7025	m469	PEGGY	He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
L439081	u7020	m469	MADDY	Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
L439073	u7025	m469	PEGGY	She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
L439072	u7020	m469	MADDY	How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
L438877	u7020	m469	MADDY	Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
L438876	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Don't get your hopes up.
L438442	u7020	m469	MADDY	It must run in the family.
L438441	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
L438438	u7020	m469	MADDY	I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
L438437	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It was Beth's idea.
L439222	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
L439221	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What?
L439220	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
L439219	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Can we split now?
L439218	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I thought I knew everything about him.
L439217	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
L439216	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Ssh. He's great.
L439213	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	What a treat.
L439212	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's Charlie!
L439211	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
L439210	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
L439209	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	You think so?
L439208	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
L439207	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
L439206	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
L439205	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
L439203	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I hate chickens.
L439202	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
L439201	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I can't do that.
L439200	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
L439199	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
L439198	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
L439197	u7025	m469	PEGGY	For everyone.
L439196	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
L439194	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
L439193	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
L438955	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
L438954	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'd love to.
L438953	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
L438952	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Is that one of your poems?
L438951	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
L438949	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
L438948	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
L438947	u7025	m469	PEGGY	They care about you. They're just a different generation.
L438946	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
L438945	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Don't you get along with your parents?
L438944	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell?O for me, Mom.'
L438943	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What are you shooting for?
L438942	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
L438941	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
L438940	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	This is great reefer.
L438932	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
L438931	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
L438930	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Coffee and a donut.
L438929	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	What're you doing here anyway?
L438928	u7025	m469	PEGGY	The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
L438927	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
L438926	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
L438925	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author ? fat, violent, drunk...
L438924	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You don't?
L438923	u7021	m469	MICHAEL	Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
L438922	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
L439232	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
L439231	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh, you're both so naive.
L439226	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
L439225	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh no!
L439224	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
L439223	u7025	m469	PEGGY	How did it go with the pantyhose?
L439106	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
L439105	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
L439102	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
L439101	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
L439096	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
L439095	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
L439059	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
L439058	u7025	m469	PEGGY	He'll win.
L439057	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
L439056	u7025	m469	PEGGY	But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
L439055	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
L439054	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yes.
L439053	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
L439052	u7025	m469	PEGGY	The hat business is in trouble.
L439051	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	This morning was good.
L439050	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Quiet today?
L439049	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
L439048	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I wanted to apologize for this morning.
L439047	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
L439046	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I closed my Christmas club.
L439044	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Open it.
L439043	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	For me?
L439042	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Doing some shopping?
L439041	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Hi, Dad.
L438980	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Evelyn, take her to her room!
L438979	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
L438978	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
L438977	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
L438976	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
L438975	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I think they're going to deregulate it.
L438974	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
L438973	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
L438972	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	All right. But this better be good.
L438971	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
L438970	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
L438969	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
L438968	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Thank God for that.
L438967	u7025	m469	PEGGY	At my age? Don't be silly.
L438966	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
L438965	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's not Charlie. It's me.
L438964	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Damn that Charlie I
L438647	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I think I'm way ahead of them.
L438646	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
L438643	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Mom, is there any coffee left?
L438642	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
L438641	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That would be impossible.
L438640	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
L438626	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Evelyn, put her to bed.
L438625	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
L438622	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
L438621	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
L438620	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Just a little. I've had a tough day.
L438619	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Young lady, you're drunk!
L439230	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
L439229	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
L439068	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	We'll make it, we'll be fine.
L439067	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Jack, I was just trying to help.
L439066	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
L439065	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Does everybody have to hear?
L439063	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Please don't shout.
L439062	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -?how could you do that?
L438631	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
L438630	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
L438629	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	A new car. We can't afford a new car.
L438624	u7022	m469	MR. KELCHER	This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
L438623	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light?headed.
L439228	u7025	m469	PEGGY	He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
L439227	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
L439180	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
L439179	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
L439178	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
L439177	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	What does Charlie think about that?
L439176	u7025	m469	PEGGY	No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell?O.
L439173	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
L439172	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
L439104	u7025	m469	PEGGY	We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
L439103	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Isn't that awfully forward?
L439098	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
L439097	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Would they go over my girdle or under?
L438982	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Way to go, Mom!
L438981	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	I'm not the maid!
L438963	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
L438962	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Where have you been?
L438827	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
L438826	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I don't feel very festive.
L438825	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Maddy's party.
L438824	u7025	m469	PEGGY	For what?
L438823	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
L438810	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
L438809	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What do you mean?
L438808	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
L438807	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
L438806	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
L438805	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
L438804	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
L438803	u7025	m469	PEGGY	She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
L438802	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
L438801	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I had a dream that Grandma died.
L438800	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	What happened to you?
L438798	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
L438797	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
L438796	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Sure, Mom.  Hello.
L438795	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Would you get that, dear?
L438794	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
L438793	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
L438792	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Who was that man?
L438661	u7025	m469	PEGGY	The house payments.
L438660	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	What about?
L438659	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Sort of.
L438658	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
L438657	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
L438644	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	When did you start drinking coffee?
L438639	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
L438638	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
L438637	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh. I forgot.
L438636	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
L438628	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
L438627	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
L438590	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm home now.
L438589	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Of course, dear. You're home now.
L438588	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
L438587	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Mom!
L438586	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	Why don't you go lie down for a while.
L438585	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm excused.
L438584	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	How do you feel?
L438583	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I have a note.
L438582	u7023	m469	MRS. KELCHER	The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
L438581	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Mom!
L439061	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
L439060	u7024	m469	NANCY	You think this'll cheer Dad up?
L438654	u7024	m469	NANCY	Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
L438653	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
L438650	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
L438649	u7024	m469	NANCY	And the butter.
L438605	u7025	m469	PEGGY	They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
L438604	u7024	m469	NANCY	Why not? They're my favorite.
L438603	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Don't eat the red ones.
L438602	u7024	m469	NANCY	Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
L438601	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
L438600	u7024	m469	NANCY	Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
L438599	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
L438598	u7024	m469	NANCY	Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
L438597	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
L438596	u7024	m469	NANCY	Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
L438595	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm just happy to see you.
L438594	u7024	m469	NANCY	What are you doing?
L439283	u7027	m469	ROSALIE	You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
L439282	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
L439281	u7027	m469	ROSALIE	Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
L439280	u7025	m469	PEGGY	But accidents can happen.
L439279	u7027	m469	ROSALIE	I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
L439278	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
L439277	u7027	m469	ROSALIE	Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
L439276	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
L439275	u7027	m469	ROSALIE	What's up?
L438485	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You have an incredible memory.
L438484	u7027	m469	ROSALIE	I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
L438483	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Rosalie Testa!
L438482	u7027	m469	ROSALIE	I remember that dress.
L439429	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
L439428	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Wait! I'll go with you!
L439427	u7025	m469	PEGGY	No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
L439426	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
L439425	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
L439424	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Did you break up with Charlie?
L439423	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
L439422	u7026	m469	RICHARD	So are you. You've got a vision.
L439421	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
L439420	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
L439419	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I came to say goodbye.
L439287	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
L439286	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
L439285	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
L439284	u7026	m469	RICHARD	What's the matter?
L439171	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
L439170	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
L439169	u7025	m469	PEGGY	God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
L439168	u7026	m469	RICHARD	I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
L439167	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
L439166	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
L439165	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
L439164	u7026	m469	RICHARD	One... two... three.  You are now awake.
L439163	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I couldn't help it ?? I loved him.
L439162	u7026	m469	RICHARD	No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
L439160	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
L439159	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Will you take of f your blouse?
L439158	u7025	m469	PEGGY	No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
L439157	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
L439156	u7025	m469	PEGGY	No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
L439155	u7026	m469	RICHARD	In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
L439154	u7025	m469	PEGGY	We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
L439153	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Silicon is from sand.
L439152	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
L439151	u7026	m469	RICHARD	What will they be made of?
L439150	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
L439149	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
L439148	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
L439147	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
L439146	u7026	m469	RICHARD	No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
L439145	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
L439144	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
L439143	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What do you know about hypnosis?
L439142	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
L439141	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Like what?
L439140	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
L439139	u7025	m469	PEGGY	For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
L439138	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
L439137	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
L439136	u7026	m469	RICHARD	That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
L439135	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
L439134	u7026	m469	RICHARD	That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
L439133	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
L439132	u7026	m469	RICHARD	What are you doing?
L439131	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Hi, Richard.
L439020	u7026	m469	RICHARD	High tech. I like the sound of that.
L439019	u7025	m469	PEGGY	The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
L439018	u7026	m469	RICHARD	What are you talking about?
L439017	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
L439014	u7026	m469	RICHARD	All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
L439013	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
L439010	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
L439009	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
L439008	u7025	m469	PEGGY	There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life?styles.
L439007	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Come on. You can't be serious.
L439006	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
L439000	u7025	m469	PEGGY	When do we start?
L438999	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You're taking advantage of a minor.
L438996	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Sixty?forty.
L438995	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty?fifty.
L438994	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Wbat're you talking about?
L438993	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
L438992	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Give me some credit, will you?
L438991	u7026	m469	RICHARD	I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
L438990	u7025	m469	PEGGY	How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
L438989	u7026	m469	RICHARD	No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
L438988	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Richard, take it easy.
L438987	u7026	m469	RICHARD	I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
L438986	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
L438985	u7026	m469	RICHARD	But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
L438984	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
L438983	u7026	m469	RICHARD	The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
L438790	u7026	m469	RICHARD	What if you're not here tomorrow?
L438789	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
L438788	u7026	m469	RICHARD	All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
L438787	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
L438786	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
L438783	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
L438782	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
L438779	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
L438778	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What're you doing?
L438777	u7026	m469	RICHARD	There's one way to find out.
L438776	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Am I dead or not?
L438775	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You're giving me the creeps.
L438774	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
L438773	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You look pretty good for a corpse.
L438772	u7025	m469	PEGGY	That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
L438771	u7026	m469	RICHARD	I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
L438770	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I don't know.
L438769	u7026	m469	RICHARD	But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
L438768	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
L438767	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
L438766	u7026	m469	RICHARD	How, did you know about my grandfather?
L438765	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
L438762	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
L438761	u7025	m469	PEGGY	This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
L438760	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Okay. I promise.
L438759	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
L438758	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
L438757	u7025	m469	PEGGY	So you think time travel is possible? For people?
L438756	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
L438755	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What's inside?
L438754	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
L438752	u7026	m469	RICHARD	That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
L438751	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What's that?
L438750	u7026	m469	RICHARD	And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
L438749	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
L438748	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Sort of.
L438747	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Are you doing some kind of science project?
L438746	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
L438745	u7026	m469	RICHARD	I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
L438744	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What a great kite.
L438729	u7026	m469	RICHARD	All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four?thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
L438728	u7025	m469	PEGGY	It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
L438727	u7026	m469	RICHARD	I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
L438726	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I have to talk to you. It's very important.
L438723	u7026	m469	RICHARD	It really wasn't that difficult.
L438722	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
L438538	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
L438537	u7026	m469	RICHARD	I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
L438536	u7025	m469	PEGGY	You're a sweet man, Richard.
L438535	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Dancing with you.
L438534	u7025	m469	PEGGY	What was?
L438533	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
L438532	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
L438531	u7026	m469	RICHARD	The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four?eyed worm.
L438457	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
L438456	u7025	m469	PEGGY	He's not here. We're getting divorced.
L438455	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
L438454	u7025	m469	PEGGY	Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
L438451	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
L438450	u7026	m469	RICHARD	You look exactly the same.
L438449	u7025	m469	PEGGY	I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
L438448	u7026	m469	RICHARD	Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
L451722	u7143	m480	ALBINO	You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
L451721	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	You don't believe me?
L451719	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	So it's to be torture.
L451718	u7143	m480	ALBINO	The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
L451717	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then why bother curing me?
L451716	u7143	m480	ALBINO	Till they kill you. Yeah.
L451715	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then I'm here till I die?
L451714	u7143	m480	ALBINO	Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
L451993	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
L451992	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I killed him myself.
L451969	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I do not marry tonight.
L451968	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Brides often are, I'm told.
L451967	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Should I be?
L451966	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
L451824	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
L451823	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
L451822	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
L451821	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	You're a silly girl.
L451820	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
L451818	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
L451817	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Every ship but the four you sent.
L451816	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
L451815	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
L451770	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Of course.
L451769	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	He will come for me.
L451749	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
L451748	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	My Westley will always come for me.
L451703	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I swear it will be done.
L451702	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"He is a sailor on the pirate ship ""Revenge."" Promise to return him to his ship."
L451701	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
L451700	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
L451645	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
L451644	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	... as ... you ... wish...
L451642	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
L451641	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
L451640	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	And what am I?
L451639	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	"I asked him what was so important for him. ""True love,"" he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are."
L451638	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	"He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, ""Please. Please, I need to live."" It was the ""please"" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53."
L451637	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Nothing you can say will upset me.
L451636	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Does it bother you to hear?
L451635	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
L451634	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You mock my pain!
L451633	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
L451632	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
L451628	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
L451627	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
L451626	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	With pride. What can I do for you?
L451625	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
L451624	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
L451623	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Rest, Highness.
L451619	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
L451618	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Are not capable of love is what you mean.
L451617	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	He knows I do not love him.
L451616	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
L451615	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
L451614	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
L451613	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
L451612	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
L451611	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
L451610	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Catch your breath.
L451607	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
L451606	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
L451605	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
L451604	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Who are you?
L452050	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
L452049	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
L452048	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"Did you say, ""I do""?"
L452047	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"But it did. I was there. This old man said, ""Man and wife."""
L452046	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
L452045	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	What?
L452044	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It never happened.
L452043	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
L452042	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	What hideous sin have you committed lately?
L452041	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
L452023	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Gently!!
L452022	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	"At a time like this that's all you can think to say? ""Gently?"""
L452021	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Gently.
L452020	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
L451687	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
L451686	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We did it.
L451683	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
L451682	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
L451681	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
L451680	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	No. No. We have already succeeded.
L451679	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
L451674	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	What? -- go on --
L451673	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, ""All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" Three years he said that. ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened."
L451671	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
L451670	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
L451669	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship ""Revenge"" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts."
L451667	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
L451666	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Singed a bit, were you?
L451663	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
L451662	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	We'll never survive.
L451654	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	There will never be a need.
L451653	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I will never doubt again.
L451652	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
L451651	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Well ... you were dead.
L451650	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	"I told you, ""I would always come for you."" Why didn't you wait for me?"
L451649	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
L451648	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Can you move at all?
L451358	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	This is true love. You think this happens every day?
L451357	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But how can you be sure?
L451356	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Hear this now: I will come for you.
L451355	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	But what if something happens to you?
L451354	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Of course you will.
L451353	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	I fear I'll never see you again.
L451339	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	As you wish.
L451338	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
L451336	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	As you wish.
L451335	u7144	m480	BUTTERCUP	Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
L451549	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
L451548	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Why should that make such a difference?
L451546	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
L451545	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Why is that, do you think?
L451542	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
L451541	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And a good thing too.
L451540	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You're quick.
L451539	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
L451538	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
L451537	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
L451536	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
L451535	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I could kill you now.
L451534	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
L451533	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
L451532	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I believe you -- So what happens now?
L451531	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
L451527	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
L451526	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Finish him, finish him. Your way.
L451525	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	What do I do?
L451524	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
L451457	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'm waiting!
L451456	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
L451445	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
L451444	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
L451443	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
L451442	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
L451441	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I thought I was going faster.
L451440	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Faster!
L451413	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Veer left. Left. Left!
L451412	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I only dog paddle.
L451397	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Anybody want a peanut?
L451396	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	No more rhymes now, I mean it.
L451382	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	"Am I going mad or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass."
L451381	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
L451380	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
L451379	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You never said anything about killing anyone.
L451378	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
L451377	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
L451376	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Who's Guilder?
L451375	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
L452009	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I'll be right back.
L452008	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
L451965	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I hope we win...
L451964	u7148	m480	INIGO	What?
L451963	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Inigo.
L451962	u7148	m480	INIGO	Right, right, sorry.
L451961	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
L451955	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
L451954	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where did you get that?
L451953	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Will this do?
L451950	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Over the Albino, I think.
L451949	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
L451934	u7148	m480	INIGO	We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
L451933	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You've been mostly dead all day.
L451928	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
L451927	u7148	m480	INIGO	Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
L451926	u7148	m480	INIGO	We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
L451925	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Has it been fifteen minutes?
L451924	u7148	m480	INIGO	What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
L451923	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
L451861	u7148	m480	INIGO	I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
L451860	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I have a little.
L451859	u7148	m480	INIGO	Have you any money?
L451858	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	The body?
L451857	u7148	m480	INIGO	Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
L451835	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Everybody ... MOVE!!
L451834	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- Fezzik, please --
L451832	u7148	m480	INIGO	His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
L451831	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	The Man in Black?
L451808	u7148	m480	INIGO	Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
L451807	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	But you don't know where he is.
L451806	u7148	m480	INIGO	To find the Man in Black, obviously.
L451805	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	-- where?
L451804	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
L451803	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	-- what? --
L451802	u7148	m480	INIGO	No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
L451800	u7148	m480	INIGO	That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
L451799	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	I don't think more than ten.
L451798	u7148	m480	INIGO	How many could you handle?
L451797	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
L451793	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Yeah?
L451792	u7148	m480	INIGO	Perhaps not. I feel fine.
L451791	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
L451790	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	True!
L451789	u7148	m480	INIGO	It's you.
L451788	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Hello.
L451395	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	If there are, we'll all be dead.
L451394	u7148	m480	INIGO	FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
L451392	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	Yes, some of the time. 
L451391	u7148	m480	INIGO	Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
L451390	u7145	m480	FEZZIK	He's really very short on charm.
L451389	u7148	m480	INIGO	Probably he means no harm.
L452098	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	As you wish...
L452097	u7153	m480	THE KID	Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
L452095	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
L452094	u7153	m480	THE KID	Okay.
L452093	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
L452090	u7153	m480	THE KID	I don't mind so much.
L452089	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
L452088	u7153	m480	THE KID	What? What?
L451856	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
L451855	u7153	m480	THE KID	No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
L451852	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
L451851	u7153	m480	THE KID	Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
L451850	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	I don't understand.
L451849	u7153	m480	THE KID	Who gets Humperdinck?
L451848	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	You want me to read this or not?
L451847	u7153	m480	THE KID	Westley's only faking, right?
L451743	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
L451742	u7153	m480	THE KID	See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
L451741	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
L451734	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
L451733	u7153	m480	THE KID	Yes.
L451732	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Do you want me to go on with this?
L451731	u7153	m480	THE KID	I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
L451730	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
L451729	u7153	m480	THE KID	You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
L451660	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
L451659	u7153	m480	THE KID	Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
L451658	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Someday, you may not mind so much.
L451657	u7153	m480	THE KID	They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
L451656	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
L451655	u7153	m480	THE KID	Oh no. No, please.
L451422	u7153	m480	THE KID	No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
L451421	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Because I can stop now if you want.
L451420	u7153	m480	THE KID	Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
L451419	u7153	m480	THE KID	Well, I wasn't nervous.
L451418	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
L451417	u7153	m480	THE KID	What?
L451360	u7153	m480	THE KID	-- murdered by pirates is good --
L451359	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
L451352	u7153	m480	THE KID	I don't be-leeve this.
L451351	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
L451349	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
L451348	u7153	m480	THE KID	-- well, when does it get good?
L451347	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	-- wait, just wait --
L451346	u7153	m480	THE KID	What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
L451345	u7153	m480	THE KID	-hold it, hold it-
L451333	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
L451332	u7153	m480	THE KID	Yeah. It's really good.
L451331	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
L451330	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
L451329	u7153	m480	THE KID	It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
L451327	u7153	m480	THE KID	Has it got any sports in it?
L451326	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
L451325	u7153	m480	THE KID	A book?
L451324	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	Open it up.
L451323	u7153	m480	THE KID	What is it?
L451322	u7146	m480	GRANDFATHER	I brought you a special present.
L451814	u7157	m480	YELLIN	The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
L451813	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Double it. My Princess must be safe.
L451812	u7157	m480	YELLIN	The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
L451811	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Rise and report.
L451775	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Try ruling the world sometime.
L451774	u7157	m480	YELLIN	It won't be easy, Sire.
L451773	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
L451772	u7157	m480	YELLIN	Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
L451771	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
L451766	u7157	m480	YELLIN	My spy network has heard no such news.
L451765	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
L451764	u7157	m480	YELLIN	Sire.
L451763	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Yellin.
L452061	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
L452060	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
L452059	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
L452058	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
L452055	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
L452054	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
L452053	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
L452052	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	No.  To the pain.
L452051	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
L451696	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	DEATH FIRST!!
L451695	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	For the last time -- SURRENDER!
L451693	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	It will not happen!
L451692	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I tell you once again -- surrender!
L451691	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
L451690	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
L451689	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
L451754	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
L451753	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
L451752	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
L451751	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
L451747	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
L451746	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Yes.
L451745	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
L451724	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Of course.
L451723	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
L451705	u7152	m480	RUGEN	I swear it will be done.
L451704	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
L451557	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
L451556	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Could this be a trap?
L451555	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
L451554	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Shall we track them both?
L451553	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
L451552	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Who won? How did it end?
L451551	u7147	m480	HUMPERDINCK	There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
L452086	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
L452085	u7148	m480	INIGO	You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
L452073	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	In that case --
L452072	u7148	m480	INIGO	No.
L452071	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I thought he was with you.
L452070	u7148	m480	INIGO	Where's Fezzik?
L451981	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Light him.
L451980	u7148	m480	INIGO	Now?
L451978	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Not yet.
L451977	u7148	m480	INIGO	Now?
L451960	u7148	m480	INIGO	I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
L451959	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
L451958	u7148	m480	INIGO	Why? You can't even lift one.
L451952	u7148	m480	INIGO	There we cannot help you.
L451951	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
L451944	u7148	m480	INIGO	Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
L451943	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	And our assets?
L451942	u7148	m480	INIGO	And it is guarded by sixty men.
L451938	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
L451937	u7148	m480	INIGO	Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
L451936	u7148	m480	INIGO	Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
L451935	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
L451930	u7156	m480	WESTLEY	I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
L451929	u7148	m480	INIGO	Your guess is as good as mine --
L452039	u7148	m480	INIGO	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
L452038	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- anything you want --
L452037	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- offer me everything I ask for --
L452036	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- all that I have and more please --
L452035	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- power too -- promise me that --
L452034	u7152	m480	RUGEN	-- yes --
L452033	u7148	m480	INIGO	-- offer me money --
L452032	u7152	m480	RUGEN	No --
L452030	u7152	m480	RUGEN	Stop saying that!
L452029	u7148	m480	INIGO	Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
L451917	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
L451916	u7148	m480	INIGO	Thank you for everything.
L451910	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
L451909	u7148	m480	INIGO	Humiliations galore!
L451892	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	"Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said ""to blave."" And, as we all know, ""to blave"" means ""to bluff."" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated"
L451891	u7148	m480	INIGO	True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
L451887	u7148	m480	INIGO	What's that?
L451886	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
L451885	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
L451884	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's dead. He can't talk.
L451883	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
L451882	u7148	m480	INIGO	I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
L451881	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Are you a rotten liar.
L451880	u7148	m480	INIGO	This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
L451879	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
L451878	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sixty-five.
L451877	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
L451876	u7148	m480	INIGO	We're really in a terrible rush.
L451875	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Hah?
L451874	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sir. Sir.
L451872	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
L451871	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's already dead.
L451870	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
L451865	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
L451864	u7148	m480	INIGO	Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
L451863	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	What? What?
L451521	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
L451520	u7148	m480	INIGO	Kill me quickly.
L451518	u7148	m480	INIGO	Okay.
L451517	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Get used to disappointment.
L451516	u7148	m480	INIGO	I must know.
L451515	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	No one of consequence.
L451514	u7148	m480	INIGO	Who are you?!
L451513	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I am not left-handed either.
L451512	u7148	m480	INIGO	Tell me.
L451511	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	There's something I ought to tell you.
L451510	u7148	m480	INIGO	I ought to be after twenty years.
L451509	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're amazing!
L451507	u7148	m480	INIGO	I am not left-handed.
L451506	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	And what is that?
L451505	u7148	m480	INIGO	Because I know something you don't know.
L451504	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Then why are you smiling?
L451503	u7148	m480	INIGO	I admit it -- you are better than I am.
L451502	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
L451501	u7148	m480	INIGO	You are wonderful!
L451497	u7148	m480	INIGO	Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
L451496	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
L451494	u7148	m480	INIGO	Begin!
L451493	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
L451492	u7148	m480	INIGO	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
L451491	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
L451490	u7148	m480	INIGO	You are ready, then?
L451489	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
L451488	u7148	m480	INIGO	More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
L451487	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You've done nothing but study swordplay?
L451486	u7148	m480	INIGO	"I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."""
L451485	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	How old were you?
L451481	u7148	m480	INIGO	My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
L451480	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Do you always begin conversations this way?
L451478	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Again. Thank you.
L451477	u7148	m480	INIGO	We'll wait until you're ready.
L451473	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Nothing comes to mind.
L451472	u7148	m480	INIGO	You don't know any way you'll trust me?
L451471	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
L451470	u7148	m480	INIGO	I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
L451469	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
L451468	u7148	m480	INIGO	But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
L451467	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	That does put a damper on our relationship.
L451466	u7148	m480	INIGO	I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
L451465	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
L451464	u7148	m480	INIGO	I do not suppose you could speed things up?
L451463	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Thank you.
L451462	u7148	m480	INIGO	Sorry.
L451461	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
L451460	u7148	m480	INIGO	Slow going?
L451455	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Oh, have it your way.
L451454	u7148	m480	INIGO	Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
L451453	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You know what a hurry we're in.
L451452	u7148	m480	INIGO	I want to duel him left-handed.
L451450	u7148	m480	INIGO	You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
L451449	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
L451438	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Inconceivable!
L451437	u7148	m480	INIGO	He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
L451435	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
L451434	u7148	m480	INIGO	Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
L451411	u7148	m480	INIGO	I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
L451410	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Go in, get after her!
L451408	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	What?
L451407	u7148	m480	INIGO	No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
L451406	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
L451405	u7148	m480	INIGO	You're sure nobody's following us?
L451404	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
L451401	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	That would be inconceivable.
L451400	u7148	m480	INIGO	Making sure nobody's following us.
L451601	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
L451600	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You guessed wrong.
L451599	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
L451598	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	What's so funny?
L451593	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I will. And I choose --
L451592	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Then make your choice.
L451591	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
L451590	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
L451589	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
L451588	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're just stalling now.
L451587	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
L451586	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Australia.
L451585	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Wait till I get going! Where was I?
L451584	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
L451583	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
L451582	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You've made your decision then7
L451581	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
L451578	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Hmm.
L451577	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
L451576	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I smell nothing.
L451575	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Inhale this, but do not touch.
L451574	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Good. Then pour the wine.
L451573	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I accept.
L451571	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	For the Princess?
L451570	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
L451569	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Morons.
L451568	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Yes.
L451567	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
L451566	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	You're that smart?
L451565	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
L451564	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
L451563	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
L451562	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
L451561	u7155	m480	VIZZINI	-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
L451560	u7149	m480	MAN IN BLACK	Let me explain-
L451922	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Bye.
L451921	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	It would take a miracle. Bye!
L451920	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Think it'll work?
L451919	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Have fun storming the castle.
L451918	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Bye-bye, boys.
L451915	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	A good hour. Yeah.
L451914	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Yeah, an hour.
L451913	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	An hour.
L451912	u7154	m480	VALERIE	The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
L451905	u7154	m480	VALERIE	Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
L451904	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Nobody's hearing nothing!
L451903	u7154	m480	VALERIE	A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
L451902	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	I'm not listening.
L451901	u7154	m480	VALERIE	What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
L451900	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
L451899	u7154	m480	VALERIE	He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
L451898	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	Don't say another word, Valerie.
L451897	u7154	m480	VALERIE	"True love. He said, ""true love,"" Max. My God --"
L451896	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
L451895	u7154	m480	VALERIE	I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
L451894	u7150	m480	MIRACLE MAX	-- get back, witch --
L451319	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Maybe he won't.
L451318	u7153	m480	THE KID	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
L451317	u7151	m480	MOTHER	You are sick, that's why he's here.
L451316	u7153	m480	THE KID	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
L451315	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Your grandfather's here.
L451314	u7153	m480	THE KID	What?
L451313	u7151	m480	MOTHER	Guess what.
L451312	u7153	m480	THE KID	A little bit.
L451311	u7151	m480	MOTHER	You feeling any better?
L457450	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
L457449	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	Yes!
L457448	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	You're losing your blood?
L457447	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	I'm losing my blood!
L457446	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	What is it now?
L457443	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	Go to sleep!
L457442	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	The wound is bleeding!
L457441	u7194	m484	DOCTOR	What is it?
L457396	u7198	m484	NURSE	The master ... is asleep!
L457395	u7195	m484	LONE	Yes!
L457394	u7198	m484	NURSE	Your father?
L457376	u7198	m484	NURSE	What did it say?
L457375	u7195	m484	LONE	That called ... commanded ...
L457374	u7198	m484	NURSE	That spoke to you?
L457373	u7195	m484	LONE	A voice ...
L457372	u7198	m484	NURSE	What were you dreaming about?
L457332	u7196	m484	MARC	No!  Good night!
L457331	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	No?
L457330	u7196	m484	MARC	There's no child here, and no dogs either.
L457329	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	But ... the dogs...
L457328	u7196	m484	MARC	There's no child here.
L457327	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	Yes.
L457326	u7196	m484	MARC	The child!
L457325	u7197	m484	NIKOLAS	Yes, the child ...
L457324	u7196	m484	MARC	Did you hear?
L457434	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Lone.
L457433	u7199	m484	THE DRAWING-ROOM	Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
L457432	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
L457431	u7199	m484	THE DRAWING-ROOM	Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
L457430	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
L457429	u7199	m484	THE DRAWING-ROOM	Joseph returns from the room where Gis?le is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
L457428	u7200	m484	THE SICK-ROOM	By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
L467152	u7247	m489	LANDO	We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
L467151	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
L467109	u7247	m489	LANDO	We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
L467108	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
L467101	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
L467100	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
L467099	u7247	m489	LANDO	You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
L467098	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
L467022	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right. Stand by.
L467021	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
L467019	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
L467018	u7247	m489	LANDO	Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
L466818	u7242	m489	BEN	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
L466817	u7249	m489	LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
L466816	u7242	m489	BEN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
L466815	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
L466814	u7242	m489	BEN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
L466813	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I have no sister.
L466812	u7242	m489	BEN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
L466811	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
L466810	u7242	m489	BEN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
L466809	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
L466808	u7242	m489	BEN	To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
L466807	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I had to help my friends.
L466806	u7242	m489	BEN	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
L466805	u7249	m489	LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
L466804	u7242	m489	BEN	You cannot escape your destiny.
L466803	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it, Ben.
L466802	u7242	m489	BEN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
L466801	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's still good in him.
L466796	u7242	m489	BEN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
L466795	u7249	m489	LUKE	You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
L466793	u7242	m489	BEN	Yoda will always be with you.
L466792	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
L466672	u7245	m489	HAN	Who are you?
L466671	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
L466670	u7245	m489	HAN	Where am I?
L466669	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Your eyesight will return in time.
L466668	u7245	m489	HAN	I can't see.
L466667	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
L467037	u7252	m489	VADER	His lightsaber.
L467036	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
L466915	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
L466914	u7252	m489	VADER	They are clear, my Master.
L466913	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
L466912	u7252	m489	VADER	I have felt him, my Master.
L466911	u7252	m489	VADER	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
L466910	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	I told you to remain on the command ship.
L466857	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes, my Master.
L466856	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
L466855	u7252	m489	VADER	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
L466854	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
L466853	u7252	m489	VADER	What is thy bidding, my Master?
L466772	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
L466771	u7252	m489	VADER	As you wish.
L466770	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
L466769	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes, my Master.
L466768	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
L466767	u7252	m489	VADER	The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
L466950	u7249	m489	LUKE	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
L466949	u7245	m489	HAN	Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
L466930	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han, don't. It'll be all right.
L466929	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey!
L466926	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah, sure.
L466925	u7249	m489	LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
L466924	u7245	m489	HAN	Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
L466893	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
L466892	u7245	m489	HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
L466890	u7249	m489	LUKE	We got separated.
L466889	u7245	m489	HAN	I thought she was with you.
L466879	u7249	m489	LUKE	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
L466878	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
L466867	u7245	m489	HAN	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
L466866	u7249	m489	LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
L466865	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know.  Fly casual.
L466864	u7245	m489	HAN	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
L466863	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
L466850	u7249	m489	LUKE	All set.
L466849	u7245	m489	HAN	Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
L466845	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yeah, she's comin' up.
L466844	u7245	m489	HAN	You got her warmed?
L466837	u7249	m489	LUKE	Hi, Han... Chewie.
L466836	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke.
L466759	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
L466758	u7245	m489	HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
L466721	u7245	m489	HAN	Oh... great!
L466720	u7249	m489	LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
L466719	u7245	m489	HAN	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
L466718	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
L466717	u7245	m489	HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
L466709	u7245	m489	HAN	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
L466708	u7249	m489	LUKE	The same as always.
L466707	u7245	m489	HAN	How are we doing?
L466706	u7249	m489	LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
L466705	u7245	m489	HAN	Fine. Together again, huh?
L466704	u7249	m489	LUKE	Are you all right?
L466703	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke!
L466702	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han!
L467183	u7245	m489	HAN	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
L467182	u7248	m489	LEIA	Yes.
L467181	u7245	m489	HAN	You love him, don't you?
L467180	u7248	m489	LEIA	He wasn't. I can feel it.
L467179	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
L467081	u7245	m489	HAN	Here's the terminal.
L467080	u7248	m489	LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
L467048	u7245	m489	HAN	Charges!  Come on, come on!
L467047	u7248	m489	LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
L467015	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
L467014	u7248	m489	LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
L466995	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hold me.
L466994	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sorry.
L466993	u7245	m489	HAN	Ahhh...
L466992	u7248	m489	LEIA	I...
L466960	u7248	m489	LEIA	I don't know.
L466959	u7245	m489	HAN	What's going on?
L466877	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
L466876	u7248	m489	LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
L466862	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
L466861	u7248	m489	LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
L466848	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
L466847	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hey, are you awake?
L466756	u7248	m489	LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
L466755	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
L466675	u7248	m489	LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
L466674	u7245	m489	HAN	Leia!
L466673	u7248	m489	LEIA	Someone who loves you.
L466843	u7245	m489	HAN	You, too.
L466842	u7247	m489	LANDO	Good luck.
L466840	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
L466839	u7245	m489	HAN	Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
L466820	u7247	m489	LANDO	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
L466819	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, look at you, a general, huh?
L466761	u7247	m489	LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
L466760	u7245	m489	HAN	Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
L466746	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
L466745	u7245	m489	HAN	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
L466744	u7247	m489	LANDO	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
L466743	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
L466737	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm trying!
L466736	u7247	m489	LANDO	Lower it!
L466735	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando, grab it!
L466733	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando!
L466732	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han! Chewie?
L467118	u7245	m489	HAN	Let's see.
L467117	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
L467106	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
L467105	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
L467104	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, Artoo, hurry!
L467103	u7245	m489	HAN	Come on! Come on!
L467102	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	We're coming!
L466945	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
L466944	u7245	m489	HAN	What did he say?
L466940	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
L466939	u7245	m489	HAN	Proper?!
L466938	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
L466937	u7245	m489	HAN	Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
L466936	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
L466935	u7245	m489	HAN	What are you telling them?
L466852	u7245	m489	HAN	All right, hang on.
L466851	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Here we go again.
L466715	u7245	m489	HAN	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
L466714	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
L466713	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
L466712	u7245	m489	HAN	Good, I hate long waits.
L466711	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
L466619	u7252	m489	VADER	I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
L466618	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	We shall double our efforts.
L466617	u7252	m489	VADER	That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
L466616	u7252	m489	VADER	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
L466615	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
L466614	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
L466613	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
L466612	u7252	m489	VADER	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
L466611	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
L466610	u7252	m489	VADER	You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
L466609	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
L467176	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
L467175	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
L467174	u7253	m489	WEDGE	There it is!
L467160	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
L467159	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
L467158	u7247	m489	LANDO	Here goes nothing.
L467157	u7253	m489	WEDGE	I'm going in.
L467137	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
L467136	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Good shot, Red Two.
L467052	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Red Leader standing by.
L467051	u7247	m489	LANDO	All wings report in.
L467028	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh, no.
L467027	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
L467026	u7248	m489	LEIA	Quiet.
L467025	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
L467017	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
L467016	u7248	m489	LEIA	What's he saying?
L466947	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Your Royal Highness.
L466946	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh!
L466682	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
L466681	u7248	m489	LEIA	Ugh!
L466988	u7249	m489	LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
L466987	u7248	m489	LEIA	But, why must you confront him?
L466986	u7249	m489	LUKE	No, you don't. You've always been strong.
L466985	u7248	m489	LEIA	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
L466984	u7249	m489	LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
L466983	u7248	m489	LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
L466982	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes. It's you Leia.
L466981	u7249	m489	LUKE	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
L466980	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
L466979	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
L466978	u7248	m489	LEIA	Your father?
L466977	u7249	m489	LUKE	He's my father.
L466974	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
L466973	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
L466972	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
L466971	u7248	m489	LEIA	She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
L466970	u7249	m489	LUKE	Tell me.
L466969	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just...images, really. Feelings.
L466968	u7249	m489	LUKE	What do you remember?
L466967	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
L466966	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
L466882	u7249	m489	LUKE	I see them. Wait, Leia!
L466881	u7248	m489	LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
L467146	u7249	m489	LUKE	Never-r-r!
L467145	u7252	m489	VADER	Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
L467144	u7252	m489	VADER	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
L467143	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you.
L467142	u7252	m489	VADER	You cannot hide forever, Luke.
L467133	u7252	m489	VADER	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
L467132	u7249	m489	LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
L467131	u7252	m489	VADER	There is no conflict.
L467130	u7249	m489	LUKE	Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
L467128	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you, father.
L467127	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
L467012	u7252	m489	VADER	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
L467011	u7249	m489	LUKE	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
L467010	u7252	m489	VADER	If that is your destiny.
L467009	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
L467008	u7252	m489	VADER	You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
L467007	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
L467006	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come with me.
L467002	u7252	m489	VADER	So, you have accepted the truth.
L467001	u7249	m489	LUKE	I know, father.
L467000	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor has been expecting you.
L466790	u7254	m489	YODA	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
L466789	u7249	m489	LUKE	Well, I'm sorry.
L466788	u7249	m489	LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
L466787	u7254	m489	YODA	Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
L466786	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes.
L466785	u7254	m489	YODA	Told you, did he?
L466784	u7254	m489	YODA	Your father he is.
L466783	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda, I must know.
L466779	u7254	m489	YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
L466778	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
L466777	u7254	m489	YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
L466776	u7249	m489	LUKE	Master Yoda, you can't die.
L466653	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Disintegrated?
L466652	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
L466651	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
L466650	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
L466649	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh. Well, yes.
L466648	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
L466647	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
L466646	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
L470995	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	So what's your next move, Valiant?
L470994	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Well, I'll be...
L470993	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
L470981	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
L470980	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Oh, a ladies man, huh?
L470973	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah...
L470972	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You serve martinis, doncha?
L470971	u7288	m492	DOLORES	We don't serve formula. Snookums.
L470992	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
L470991	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
L470988	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
L470987	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it then?
L470986	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
L470983	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
L470982	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
L470978	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
L470977	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
L470976	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
L470975	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
L470974	u7285	m492	BABY HERMAN	Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
L470863	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
L470862	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
L470861	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
L470860	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Shoulda guessed.
L470859	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
L470858	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
L470857	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
L470856	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
L470855	u7286	m492	BETTY BOOP	Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
L470788	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
L470787	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
L470786	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
L470785	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
L470783	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
L470782	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A tweeting bird?
L470781	u7287	m492	DIRECTOR	What's this, Roger?
L471319	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
L471318	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
L471317	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
L471316	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
L471315	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
L471314	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'll bet.
L471313	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
L471208	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, no...
L471207	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Sounds like singin'.
L471206	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's that comin' from the bar?
L471205	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
L471204	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
L471203	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
L471202	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon, right?
L471201	u7288	m492	DOLORES	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
L471200	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
L471199	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
L471198	u7295	m492	VALIANT	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
L471197	u7288	m492	DOLORES	What was <u>that</u>?
L471083	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
L471082	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
L471079	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
L471078	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
L471073	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
L471072	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So what's the scam, Eddie?
L471066	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
L471065	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
L471057	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
L471056	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you decided to help him after all?
L471055	u7288	m492	DOLORES	It's all yours.
L471054	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
L471053	u7288	m492	DOLORES	He's a riot.
L471048	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
L471047	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
L470998	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's a Toon... who cares?
L470997	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
L470990	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
L470989	u7288	m492	DOLORES	The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
L470985	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L470984	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
L470969	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
L470968	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Do you think the rabbit did it?
L470962	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Bastards put him on notice.
L470961	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
L470960	u7288	m492	DOLORES	A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
L470957	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
L470956	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
L470835	u7288	m492	DOLORES	R.K. Maroon.
L470834	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Check the scrawl.
L470833	u7288	m492	DOLORES	Is this paper even good?
L470832	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
L470831	u7288	m492	DOLORES	This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
L470830	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
L470829	u7288	m492	DOLORES	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
L471487	u7289	m492	DOOM	That's right, me.
L471486	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You?
L471483	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
L471482	u7289	m492	DOOM	Surprised?
L471481	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
L471447	u7289	m492	DOOM	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
L471446	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
L471445	u7289	m492	DOOM	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
L471444	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell's a freeway?
L471443	u7289	m492	DOOM	Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
L471441	u7289	m492	DOOM	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
L471440	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
L471427	u7289	m492	DOOM	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
L471426	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
L471425	u7289	m492	DOOM	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
L471424	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So you're Cloverleaf?
L471423	u7289	m492	DOOM	No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
L471411	u7289	m492	DOOM	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
L471410	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
L471409	u7289	m492	DOOM	These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
L471258	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
L471257	u7289	m492	DOOM	Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
L471253	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
L471252	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
L471145	u7289	m492	DOOM	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
L471144	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
L471143	u7289	m492	DOOM	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
L471142	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
L471141	u7289	m492	DOOM	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
L471140	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
L471139	u7289	m492	DOOM	Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
L471138	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
L471137	u7289	m492	DOOM	They?
L471136	u7295	m492	VALIANT	They must've taken it off me.
L471132	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
L471131	u7289	m492	DOOM	Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
L471128	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Ask her...
L471127	u7289	m492	DOOM	Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
L470933	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
L470932	u7289	m492	DOOM	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
L470931	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
L470930	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
L470929	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
L470925	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
L470924	u7289	m492	DOOM	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
L470923	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
L471160	u7290	m492	EARL	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
L471159	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
L471158	u7290	m492	EARL	Does it hurt?
L471157	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No...
L471156	u7290	m492	EARL	You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
L471155	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What am I, Earl?
L471154	u7290	m492	EARL	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
L471153	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Toon cops worked me over.
L471152	u7290	m492	EARL	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
L471151	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
L471150	u7290	m492	EARL	Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
L471406	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Eddie, come on.
L471405	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hold on a second.
L471397	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	He made me laugh.
L471396	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
L471395	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
L471394	u7295	m492	VALIANT	A joker to the end.
L471393	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
L471392	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So where is it?
L471391	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
L471390	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How did you get onto Doom?
L471387	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He's right here in the...
L471386	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Where is he?
L471385	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
L471384	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I didn't know who I could trust.
L471383	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why didn't you tell me?
L471382	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
L471379	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
L471378	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
L471377	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
L471376	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You shot Roger.
L471187	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
L471186	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
L471185	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
L471184	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So altruistic.
L471182	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
L471181	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
L471180	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
L471179	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
L471178	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
L471177	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	No, no, no... I love my husband.
L471176	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
L471175	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
L471174	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
L471173	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Toons aren't given imperfections.
L471172	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
L471170	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
L471169	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
L471168	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's because I don't have a doorbell.
L471167	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
L471130	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
L471129	u7291	m492	JESSICA RABBIT	Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
L471493	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
L471492	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Doom.
L471491	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	What the hell is that?
L470951	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
L470950	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What's with the dip?
L470940	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
L470939	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
L470910	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Wait here...
L470909	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What a gasser.
L470908	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
L470906	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
L470905	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Now what?
L470903	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's what you woke me up for?
L470902	u7292	m492	LT. SANTINO	Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
L471349	u7293	m492	MAROON	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
L471348	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Take it easy.
L471347	u7293	m492	MAROON	You tricked me, damn you!
L471346	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, I don't.
L471345	u7293	m492	MAROON	You got the will in there, don't ya?
L471343	u7293	m492	MAROON	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
L471342	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
L471341	u7293	m492	MAROON	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
L471340	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
L471339	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That was the idea.
L471338	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant!  You surprised me.
L471324	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Stop what?
L471323	u7293	m492	MAROON	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
L471322	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maybe.  Why?
L471321	u7293	m492	MAROON	Have you got the will?
L471320	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
L471099	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
L471098	u7293	m492	MAROON	I've already seen your photographs.
L471097	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
L471096	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
L471095	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
L470894	u7293	m492	MAROON	Sure, Valiant, sure...
L470893	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
L470888	u7293	m492	MAROON	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
L470887	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
L470820	u7295	m492	VALIANT	As soon as is humanly possible.
L470819	u7293	m492	MAROON	When will I hear from you?
L470818	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aren't you the lucky one...
L470817	u7293	m492	MAROON	I got him on loan from Disney.
L470813	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So's the job.
L470812	u7293	m492	MAROON	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
L470811	u7295	m492	VALIANT	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
L470810	u7293	m492	MAROON	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
L470809	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I don't work in Toontown.
L470808	u7293	m492	MAROON	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
L470807	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So what do you want me to do?
L470806	u7293	m492	MAROON	"Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up."
L470805	u7293	m492	MAROON	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
L470804	u7295	m492	VALIANT	One too many safes dropped on his head?
L470803	u7293	m492	MAROON	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
L470802	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
L470801	u7293	m492	MAROON	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
L470795	u7293	m492	MAROON	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
L470794	u7295	m492	VALIANT	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
L470793	u7293	m492	MAROON	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
L471518	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	From this box here...
L471517	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
L471516	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Only time will tell.
L471515	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
L471514	u7295	m492	VALIANT	By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
L471512	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
L471511	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, kid, you're a real hero.
L471508	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
L471507	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Keep reading...
L471505	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Good idea.
L471504	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you oughta read it to her.
L471503	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471502	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
L471498	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah...
L471497	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
L471496	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
L471456	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
L471455	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
L471369	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
L471368	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin' in there?
L471335	u7295	m492	VALIANT	... I'd head for Cucamonga.
L471334	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
L471333	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I don't make it back here by ten...
L471332	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I rest my case.
L471331	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Two bits.
L471330	u7295	m492	VALIANT	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
L471329	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
L471328	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Forget it.
L471327	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
L471326	u7295	m492	VALIANT	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
L471325	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
L471311	u7295	m492	VALIANT	No, it's not.
L471310	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Wrong number?
L471309	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Get away from there.
L471308	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I'll get it.
L471307	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
L471306	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Safe?
L471305	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
L471304	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
L471303	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
L471302	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A Toon?  Noooo.
L471301	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
L471300	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
L471299	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
L471296	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What is this, Twenty Questions?
L471295	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
L471294	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Me.
L471293	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Say, who's this guy laughin'?
L471291	u7295	m492	VALIANT	We can't do anything till it's dark.
L471290	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
L471289	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My brother.  Get inside.
L471288	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
L471264	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
L471263	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
L471261	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
L471260	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
L471259	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
L471256	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
L471255	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
L471254	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
L471225	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
L471224	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
L471223	u7295	m492	VALIANT	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
L471222	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
L471221	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
L471220	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
L471219	u7295	m492	VALIANT	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
L471218	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
L471217	u7295	m492	VALIANT	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
L471216	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
L471215	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
L471214	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Hey, don't I get an encore?
L471081	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
L471080	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
L471077	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
L471076	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	How do you know that?
L471075	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
L471074	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	The habeus corpus is thickening.
L471071	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
L471070	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
L471069	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
L471064	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
L471063	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
L471062	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
L471061	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
L471060	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
L471059	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Yeah, that's better.
L471058	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Does this help?
L471039	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Don't ever forget that.
L471038	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
L471037	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
L471034	u7295	m492	VALIANT	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
L471033	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
L471019	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
L471018	u7295	m492	VALIANT	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
L471017	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
L471016	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
L471008	u7295	m492	VALIANT	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
L471007	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
L471006	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
L471005	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
L471004	u7295	m492	VALIANT	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
L471003	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
L471002	u7295	m492	VALIANT	What the hell are you doin'?
L471001	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Aah!
L471000	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Aah!
L470897	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Divorce?  Never!
L470896	u7295	m492	VALIANT	My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
L470882	u7295	m492	VALIANT	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
L470881	u7294	m492	ROGER RABBIT	Pattycake!  Pattycake!
L511748	u7643	m517	BALTUS	He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
L511747	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	How did you hear this?
L511746	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
L511595	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
L511594	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
L511363	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
L511362	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Hail, Constable.  How are you?
L511339	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
L511338	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
L511337	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Who took the meat?
L511285	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
L511284	u7643	m517	BALTUS	Many have.
L511283	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
L511260	u7643	m517	BALTUS	This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
L511259	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If we could speak alone.
L511554	u7644	m517	BROM	I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
L511553	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I hit him square.
L511552	u7644	m517	BROM	You must have missed your mark.
L511551	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
L511550	u7644	m517	BROM	Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
L511447	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Two days... ?  For murder?
L511446	u7644	m517	BROM	They spend two days in chains.
L511345	u7644	m517	BROM	Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
L511344	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
L511343	u7644	m517	BROM	What the hell are you doing?
L511254	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
L511253	u7644	m517	BROM	We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
L511250	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
L511249	u7644	m517	BROM	Certainly not.
L511843	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
L511842	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	What?
L511841	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
L511838	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	What of it?
L511837	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Stains of blood.
L511836	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
L511835	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
L511815	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You will stay at her side?
L511814	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
L511666	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	You need rest.
L511665	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Bring him.
L511664	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	You need to sleep.
L511663	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Bring Young Masbath here.
L511662	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
L511661	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	... Brom Bones...
L511660	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
L511392	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
L511391	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
L511390	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
L511368	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	A diseased monster.
L511367	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He is a behemoth.
L511366	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
L511365	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What are you spying on?
L511364	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	We must be a curious sight to him.
L511354	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
L511353	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	What is that?
L511352	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No bleeding.
L511342	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	To place it inside its coffin.
L511341	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why did you move the body, Doctor?
L511267	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	I was afraid of this.
L511266	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
L511265	u7645	m517	DOCTOR LANCASTER	Excuse me?
L511264	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
L511767	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
L511766	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
L511765	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
L511764	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
L511763	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
L511762	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Wallowing quite literally in blood.
L511761	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	They need guidance.
L511760	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Wallowing in sin and lust...
L511759	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	I am the Lord's voice in this town.
L511758	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
L511757	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
L511756	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
L511755	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
L511754	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
L511449	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Does that look like an animal hanging?
L511448	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
L511382	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
L511381	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Your superiors are two days away!
L511380	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Protest to my superiors if you like.
L511379	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	I will not allow it.  I will not!
L511377	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
L511376	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	It is sacrilege!
L511272	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
L511271	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
L511270	u7646	m517	FATHER STEENWYCK	Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
L511694	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Well... that might be... helpful.
L511693	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
L511692	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Master Hardenbrook...
L511691	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Damn... damn... damn...
L511688	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	A fine idea.
L511687	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Maybe you should take this.
L511686	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
L511685	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	May we look at them now?
L511684	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Hmm?  See them?
L511683	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
L511681	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
L511680	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
L511679	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Do you have these persons' wills?
L511280	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
L511279	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
L511274	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Pardon me?
L511273	u7647	m517	HARDENBROOK	Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
L511240	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
L511239	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I shall, gladly.
L511238	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
L511237	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Not for lack of trying.
L511236	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	"These ""methods"" of yours... there has been no practical application."
L511235	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Chosen me?
L511234	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
L511232	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
L511231	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
L511230	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
L511229	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Very few, if any.
L511228	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
L511227	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
L511226	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
L511225	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Have they nothing to fear presently?
L511224	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
L511221	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
L511220	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
L511219	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
L511218	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
L511217	u7648	m517	HIGH CONSTABLE	He drowned.  Anyone could see.
L511216	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
L511386	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
L511385	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Is that all you say?  Look at her.
L511384	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	The Widow Windsor.
L511374	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
L511373	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
L511372	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
L511371	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
L511370	u7651	m517	KILLIAN	Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
L511426	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	At times I do.
L511425	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
L511424	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Listen to what you say....
L511421	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I know it.
L511420	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
L511419	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
L511418	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
L511334	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Well... so much for common sense.
L511333	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
L511332	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is that you wear?
L511328	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Believe?
L511327	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
L511325	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
L511324	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
L511323	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	And now Jonathan Masbath.
L511322	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
L511269	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The militia?
L511268	u7654	m517	PHILIPSE	Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
L511936	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Tired.
L511935	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	How are you?
L511902	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I doubt that's the end.
L511901	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What now?
L511893	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Take the reins.
L511892	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What can we do?
L511883	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I know.  Hold on.
L511882	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Lady Van Tassel...
L511881	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Climb up!
L511825	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
L511824	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
L511823	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	This is farewell.
L511821	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
L511820	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Why... why are you like this?
L511819	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
L511818	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
L511817	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
L511816	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
L511752	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
L511751	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What now?  Where is she?
L511728	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
L511727	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
L511726	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What books?
L511725	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
L511724	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
L511720	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	No.  They are all missing.
L511719	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
L511718	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What was she doing?
L511717	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Lady Van Tassel.
L511716	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I was getting worried.  Who was it?
L511714	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  ""Paasch, James"" ""Pieter, Thomas"" ""Pos, William."""
L511713	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
L511709	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
L511708	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Did your father take a loan?
L511707	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Baltus Van Tassel.
L511706	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
L511705	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What does it mean?
L511704	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
L511703	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	In test... what?
L511702	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
L511701	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
L511700	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
L511697	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Yes.
L511696	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
L511695	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
L511690	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
L511689	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What good is this?
L511672	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
L511671	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
L511670	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
L511669	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	All I saw was their lantern.
L511668	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Man or woman?
L511667	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
L511623	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why this tree?
L511622	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	We should go.
L511621	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
L511616	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Stay back.
L511615	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What is it?
L511602	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
L511601	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
L511600	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	True enough.
L511599	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
L511598	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
L511597	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
L511529	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"Let loose his silent shrieking. Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  ""He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand."" Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives."
L511528	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
L511527	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
L511526	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Should we go back?
L511525	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We should not go much further in this murk.
L511524	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"How could something named ""the tree of the dead"" fail to draw attention?"
L511523	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
L511522	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What happened?
L511521	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We are leaving.
L511497	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
L511496	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I hear nothing.
L511495	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Listen.
L511494	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is it?
L511474	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Witches do not exist.  However...
L511473	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Father said witches live there.
L511472	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
L511471	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
L511470	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Thank you.
L511469	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I have others.  All I need is this.
L511468	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	No, I couldn't...
L511467	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
L511466	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	It's spectacular.
L511465	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
L511464	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	What kind of nuts?
L511463	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Are you familiar with magnets?
L511461	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Look again.
L511460	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	The Western Woods.
L511459	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Out there.  What do you see?
L511458	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
L511457	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is it?
L511456	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Up.
L511455	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Where are we going?
L511454	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
L511453	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	How could he?
L511452	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
L511389	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
L511388	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I'm sure I don't know.
L511387	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What is the common thread between these victims?
L511361	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I did not ask you to, did I?
L511360	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
L511359	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
L511358	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I manage fine alone.
L511357	u7658	m517	YOUNG MASBATH	Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
L511356	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
L511921	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	We have no choice.
L511920	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I... I can't do this.
L511919	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
L511917	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
L511916	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Quickly, close it.
L511913	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Keep climbing.  I will follow...
L511912	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Ichabod...
L511906	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	His horse.
L511905	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What was that?
L511904	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He moves too fast.
L511903	u7650	m517	KATRINA	The church.
L511887	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I do not know.  Away.
L511886	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Where are we going?
L511790	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
L511789	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Katrina...
L511788	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
L511787	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
L511786	u7650	m517	KATRINA	If you think I am behind this, say it.
L511785	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What would you have me believe?
L511784	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
L511783	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
L511782	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I have not been able to face him yet.
L511781	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What did he say, Katrina?
L511780	u7650	m517	KATRINA	He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
L511779	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	And, what did he say?
L511778	u7650	m517	KATRINA	When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
L511777	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It was you there?
L511776	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
L511772	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Come with me.
L511771	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What is so urgent?
L511659	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
L511658	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What... what are you doing... ?
L511629	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
L511628	u7650	m517	KATRINA	The skull is gone.
L511627	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
L511620	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
L511619	u7650	m517	KATRINA	My God... what has happened?
L511618	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Just... keep where you are.
L511617	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What are you doing?
L511614	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What did you say?
L511613	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Blood.
L511610	u7650	m517	KATRINA	But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
L511609	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
L511608	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I apologize if I worried you.
L511607	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Katrina.  Why do you follow?
L511606	u7650	m517	KATRINA	It is only me.
L511586	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
L511585	u7650	m517	KATRINA	If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
L511584	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
L511583	u7650	m517	KATRINA	She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
L511582	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
L511581	u7650	m517	KATRINA	No, but... why do you ask that?
L511580	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	She is not your birth mother, is she?
L511579	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What?
L511578	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
L511577	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What has happened?
L511576	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
L511575	u7650	m517	KATRINA	The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
L511574	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What troubles you?
L511573	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
L511493	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
L511492	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
L511491	u7650	m517	KATRINA	But, why?  Tell me why.
L511490	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	To avenge his father, and the others.
L511489	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
L511488	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
L511487	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
L511486	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It was not butchery.
L511485	u7650	m517	KATRINA	And this gives worth to butchery?
L511484	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
L511483	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Must I hear this?
L511482	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
L511481	u7650	m517	KATRINA	What are you on about?
L511480	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
L511479	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
L511478	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
L511477	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Why would you do such a thing?
L511442	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
L511441	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	They have done nothing of the sort.
L511440	u7650	m517	KATRINA	People have put their trust in you.
L511439	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
L511438	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You promised justice.
L511417	u7650	m517	KATRINA	That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
L511416	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
L511415	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I insist that you have it.
L511414	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Thank you.  No.  Here...
L511413	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
L511412	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	If you want.  But...
L511411	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
L511410	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
L511409	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
L511408	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You made this, and the drawings?
L511407	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
L511406	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Yes, he does.  May I try?
L511405	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
L511404	u7650	m517	KATRINA	It would be interesting to find out.
L511403	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
L511402	u7650	m517	KATRINA	These scars.  How did you get them?
L511400	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
L511399	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
L511398	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
L511397	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
L511319	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You are funny.
L511318	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
L511317	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
L511316	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There is no such thing as magic.
L511315	u7650	m517	KATRINA	To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
L511314	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Are you so superstitious?
L511313	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
L511311	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
L511310	u7650	m517	KATRINA	I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
L511309	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was ""no"" at least once."
L511308	u7650	m517	KATRINA	He has proposed to me twice.
L511307	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	"The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call ""friend,"" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy."
L511306	u7650	m517	KATRINA	My suitor?
L511305	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
L511304	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
L511303	u7650	m517	KATRINA	It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
L511302	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Small talk.
L511301	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Other people?
L511300	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
L511299	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
L511298	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
L511297	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
L511296	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
L511295	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
L511252	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
L511251	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Forgive me, I didn't know.
L511931	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Yes... yes.  I think I will...
L511930	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Let her go!
L511929	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	You cannot kill what is already dead.
L511742	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What... ?
L511741	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	I know you saw me.
L511740	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is fine.  Now, I must...
L511739	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
L511738	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It appears well.  It has already clotted.
L511736	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Very little.  I must be going...
L511735	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
L511734	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Where?
L511733	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	No.  She has gone out.
L511732	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
L511592	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
L511591	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
L511590	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Use caution.
L511589	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Yes, actually.
L511588	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Returning to the Western Woods?
L511330	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
L511329	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
L511852	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	Yes.  Here...
L511851	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
L511831	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Turn around.  Now!
L511830	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	What did you say?
L511829	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
L511351	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	I didn't see none.
L511350	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	There was not much blood, was there?
L511349	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
L511348	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
L511347	u7656	m517	VAN RIPPER	I can show exactly.
L511346	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
L511513	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
L511512	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	What... what are you doing?
L511511	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
L511510	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Can you help?
L511509	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	Sit.
L511508	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Horseman.  Yes.
L511507	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
L511503	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
L511502	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
L511501	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	In a way, yes.
L511500	u7653	m517	OLD CRONE	You are from the Hollow?
L511499	u7649	m517	ICHABOD	Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
L511867	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
L511866	u7650	m517	KATRINA	No one will believe your lies, whore.
L511865	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
L511862	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
L511861	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Father saw you die.
L511860	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	He rides tonight.
L511857	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
L511856	u7650	m517	KATRINA	You... you are alive.
L511657	u7652	m517	LADY VAN TASSEL	Doctor, he is awake.
L511656	u7650	m517	KATRINA	Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
L511569	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
L511568	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	No.
L511567	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	She has confessed.
L511566	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	No, sir, please... she is innocent...
L511565	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	She is guilty.
L511564	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	She did not do it... please listen...
L511563	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
L511562	u7657	m517	YOUNG ICHABOD	May I see my mother?
L511561	u7655	m517	THIRD MAN	Go home.
L542275	u7816	m529	BEN	May the Force be with you.
L542274	u7821	m529	HAN	We'll be back before you are, old man.
L542273	u7816	m529	BEN	That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
L542257	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not going out there.
L542256	u7816	m529	BEN	There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
L542255	u7821	m529	HAN	Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
L542251	u7816	m529	BEN	It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
L542250	u7821	m529	HAN	Is that good or bad?
L542249	u7816	m529	BEN	Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
L542224	u7821	m529	HAN	What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
L542223	u7816	m529	BEN	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
L542222	u7821	m529	HAN	I'll get the information.
L542221	u7816	m529	BEN	All right then, we'll use your plan.
L542220	u7821	m529	HAN	We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
L542219	u7816	m529	BEN	Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
L542218	u7821	m529	HAN	We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
L542206	u7821	m529	HAN	Not bad.
L542205	u7816	m529	BEN	You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
L542202	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not afraid of anything...
L542201	u7816	m529	BEN	Fear is their greatest weapon.
L542200	u7821	m529	HAN	Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
L542198	u7821	m529	HAN	This isn't a game, you know.
L542197	u7816	m529	BEN	Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
L542186	u7821	m529	HAN	Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
L542185	u7816	m529	BEN	A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
L542184	u7821	m529	HAN	How much do you think she's talking about?
L542183	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm beginning not to like you.
L542182	u7816	m529	BEN	I think there are some things we should talk about.
L542181	u7821	m529	HAN	Who's going to pay me then?
L542180	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
L542177	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
L542176	u7816	m529	BEN	No, not anymore.
L542175	u7821	m529	HAN	Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
L542174	u7816	m529	BEN	We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
L542173	u7821	m529	HAN	Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
L542172	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
L542171	u7821	m529	HAN	The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
L542170	u7816	m529	BEN	The Empire must have gotten here first.
L542162	u7821	m529	HAN	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
L542161	u7816	m529	BEN	Well, we'll see...
L542090	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
L542089	u7821	m529	HAN	I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
L542433	u7816	m529	BEN	Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
L542432	u7824	m529	LUKE	The Kiber Crystal.
L542254	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm not going alone!
L542253	u7816	m529	BEN	You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
L542252	u7824	m529	LUKE	What about the princess?
L542216	u7824	m529	LUKE	I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
L542215	u7816	m529	BEN	See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
L542214	u7816	m529	BEN	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
L542213	u7824	m529	LUKE	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
L542212	u7816	m529	BEN	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
L542211	u7824	m529	LUKE	I can't see!  How can I fight?
L542192	u7816	m529	BEN	I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
L542191	u7824	m529	LUKE	You mean we should go after her!...
L542190	u7816	m529	BEN	But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
L542165	u7824	m529	LUKE	He can't find Organa Major.
L542164	u7816	m529	BEN	What is it?
L542157	u7816	m529	BEN	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
L542156	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do I do?
L542155	u7816	m529	BEN	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
L542154	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you sure you don't need it?
L542142	u7816	m529	BEN	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
L542141	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you all right?
L542140	u7816	m529	BEN	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
L542139	u7824	m529	LUKE	What's wrong?  What's happening?
L542138	u7816	m529	BEN	These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
L542137	u7824	m529	LUKE	But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
L542136	u7816	m529	BEN	I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
L542135	u7824	m529	LUKE	When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
L542117	u7816	m529	BEN	He's bluffing...
L542116	u7824	m529	LUKE	This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
L542094	u7816	m529	BEN	Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
L542093	u7824	m529	LUKE	We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
L542061	u7816	m529	BEN	There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
L542060	u7824	m529	LUKE	Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
L542059	u7816	m529	BEN	They use the Bogan Force.
L542058	u7824	m529	LUKE	Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
L542057	u7816	m529	BEN	Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
L542056	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's where my father was killed.
L542055	u7816	m529	BEN	I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
L542054	u7824	m529	LUKE	Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
L542053	u7816	m529	BEN	When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
L542052	u7824	m529	LUKE	How can you store an energy field within you?
L542051	u7816	m529	BEN	A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
L542050	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
L542049	u7816	m529	BEN	Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
L542047	u7816	m529	BEN	It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
L542046	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do you mean?
L542045	u7816	m529	BEN	That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
L542044	u7824	m529	LUKE	Could I learn to feel it?
L542043	u7816	m529	BEN	It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
L542042	u7824	m529	LUKE	You mean I generate an energy field?
L542041	u7816	m529	BEN	Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
L542040	u7824	m529	LUKE	My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
L542039	u7816	m529	BEN	You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
L542034	u7816	m529	BEN	Not any more!
L542033	u7824	m529	LUKE	But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
L542032	u7816	m529	BEN	I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
L542031	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
L542030	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
L542028	u7824	m529	LUKE	My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
L542027	u7816	m529	BEN	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
L542026	u7824	m529	LUKE	I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
L542025	u7816	m529	BEN	You could put it that way.
L542024	u7824	m529	LUKE	You saw through me?
L542023	u7816	m529	BEN	I know that.
L542022	u7824	m529	LUKE	I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
L542021	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
L542020	u7816	m529	BEN	I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
L542019	u7824	m529	LUKE	I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
L542018	u7816	m529	BEN	I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
L542016	u7816	m529	BEN	I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
L542015	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
L542014	u7816	m529	BEN	You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
L542013	u7824	m529	LUKE	Who are you anyway?
L542009	u7824	m529	LUKE	Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
L542008	u7816	m529	BEN	Oh, so you're a warrior then?
L542007	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
L542000	u7816	m529	BEN	You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
L541999	u7824	m529	LUKE	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
L541998	u7816	m529	BEN	Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
L541996	u7816	m529	BEN	All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
L541995	u7824	m529	LUKE	What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
L541994	u7816	m529	BEN	Good morning!
L541933	u7817	m529	BIGGS	Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
L541932	u7824	m529	LUKE	At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
L541931	u7817	m529	BIGGS	The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
L541930	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
L541929	u7817	m529	BIGGS	I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
L541910	u7824	m529	LUKE	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
L541909	u7817	m529	BIGGS	That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
L541905	u7824	m529	LUKE	You look great!  The uniform and everything!
L541904	u7817	m529	BIGGS	Of course, where you been kid?
L542494	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Forget it, son.
L542493	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir, but I can get him...
L542492	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
L542491	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	What's that?
L542490	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
L542464	u7824	m529	LUKE	I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
L542463	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
L542452	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.
L542451	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
L542450	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
L542449	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	Have you been checked out?
L542448	u7824	m529	LUKE	Yes, sir.
L542447	u7818	m529	BLUE LEADER	You're Starkiller?
L542233	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
L542232	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
L542230	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	Send one squad up.
L542229	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
L542228	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	I'll make a report later.
L542227	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	Should we alert the Sith Lords?
L542226	u7819	m529	COMMANDER	Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
L542225	u7820	m529	CONTROLLER	No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
L542421	u7823	m529	LEIA	I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
L542420	u7821	m529	HAN	What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
L542413	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
L542412	u7823	m529	LEIA	We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
L542411	u7823	m529	LEIA	Did it occur to you they might find us?
L542410	u7821	m529	HAN	I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
L542401	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd better go see how he's doing.
L542400	u7823	m529	LEIA	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
L542399	u7821	m529	HAN	Where are you taking us now anyway?
L542398	u7823	m529	LEIA	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
L542397	u7823	m529	LEIA	The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
L542396	u7821	m529	HAN	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
L542395	u7823	m529	LEIA	When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
L542394	u7821	m529	HAN	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
L542393	u7823	m529	LEIA	All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
L542389	u7821	m529	HAN	Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
L542388	u7823	m529	LEIA	There are only three or four left.
L542386	u7821	m529	HAN	Was this trip really necessary?
L542385	u7823	m529	LEIA	Here come six more... grid two!
L542363	u7823	m529	LEIA	It could be worse...
L542362	u7821	m529	HAN	Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
L542361	u7823	m529	LEIA	Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
L542511	u7824	m529	LUKE	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
L542510	u7821	m529	HAN	I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
L542429	u7821	m529	HAN	I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
L542428	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
L542408	u7821	m529	HAN	Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
L542407	u7824	m529	LUKE	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
L542406	u7821	m529	HAN	I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
L542349	u7824	m529	LUKE	Come back here... Where are you going?
L542348	u7821	m529	HAN	Get to the ship!
L542328	u7821	m529	HAN	Move out of the way!
L542327	u7824	m529	LUKE	It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
L542323	u7824	m529	LUKE	Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
L542322	u7821	m529	HAN	Watch it!  Move back.
L542320	u7821	m529	HAN	No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
L542319	u7824	m529	LUKE	Is he afraid of the water?
L542314	u7821	m529	HAN	Not if this tunnel deadends.
L542313	u7824	m529	LUKE	I think she's going to be all right.
L542308	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
L542307	u7821	m529	HAN	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
L542306	u7824	m529	LUKE	Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
L542282	u7821	m529	HAN	I think I did.
L542281	u7824	m529	LUKE	Why didn't you say so before.
L542280	u7821	m529	HAN	This isn't going to work.
L542268	u7821	m529	HAN	Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
L542267	u7824	m529	LUKE	Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
L542209	u7824	m529	LUKE	I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
L542208	u7821	m529	HAN	You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
L542207	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, I practice a lot...
L542196	u7821	m529	HAN	Don't you believe it.
L542195	u7824	m529	LUKE	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
L542194	u7821	m529	HAN	No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
L542188	u7821	m529	HAN	All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
L542187	u7824	m529	LUKE	Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
L542179	u7821	m529	HAN	Why?
L542178	u7824	m529	LUKE	You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
L542167	u7824	m529	LUKE	What are you saying?
L542166	u7821	m529	HAN	I found it... It's just not there.
L542160	u7821	m529	HAN	Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
L542159	u7824	m529	LUKE	You don't believe in the Force?
L542158	u7821	m529	HAN	I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
L542151	u7821	m529	HAN	It's automatic.
L542150	u7824	m529	LUKE	Who's the pilot?
L542097	u7824	m529	LUKE	We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
L542096	u7821	m529	HAN	You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
L542092	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
L542091	u7821	m529	HAN	Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
L542292	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	Who is this?  What's your operating...
L542291	u7824	m529	LUKE	The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
L542290	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	With four casualties?!
L542289	u7824	m529	LUKE	No need, everything's under control.
L542288	u7822	m529	INTERCOM VOICE	We'll send a squad up.
L542287	u7824	m529	LUKE	A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
L542148	u7827	m529	VADER	It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
L542147	u7823	m529	LEIA	No!...
L542146	u7827	m529	VADER	It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
L542145	u7823	m529	LEIA	They'll find its weakness.
L542144	u7827	m529	VADER	The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
L541922	u7827	m529	VADER	It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
L541921	u7823	m529	LEIA	You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
L541920	u7827	m529	VADER	Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
L542426	u7823	m529	LEIA	If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
L542425	u7824	m529	LUKE	I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
L542424	u7823	m529	LEIA	And you?
L542405	u7823	m529	LEIA	He'll be well cared for.
L542404	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
L542333	u7823	m529	LEIA	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
L542332	u7824	m529	LUKE	I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
L542317	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
L542316	u7823	m529	LEIA	What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
L541955	u7825	m529	OWEN	Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
L541954	u7824	m529	LUKE	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
L541953	u7825	m529	OWEN	I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
L541952	u7824	m529	LUKE	But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
L541951	u7825	m529	OWEN	You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
L541950	u7824	m529	LUKE	I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
L541949	u7825	m529	OWEN	First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
L542438	u7824	m529	LUKE	I'd consider it an honor.
L542437	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
L542369	u7824	m529	LUKE	Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
L542368	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Are you there, sir?  We're going...
L542367	u7824	m529	LUKE	Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
L542352	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio!  Do you copy?
L542351	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
L542346	u7824	m529	LUKE	Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
L542345	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
L542344	u7824	m529	LUKE	Are you safe?
L542343	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
L542342	u7824	m529	LUKE	You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
L542341	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I read you sir.
L542340	u7824	m529	LUKE	See Threepio... do you copy?
L542272	u7824	m529	LUKE	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
L542271	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
L542153	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
L542152	u7824	m529	LUKE	Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
L542113	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
L542112	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
L542111	u7824	m529	LUKE	I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
L542005	u7824	m529	LUKE	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
L542004	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
L542003	u7824	m529	LUKE	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
L542002	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
L541988	u7824	m529	LUKE	Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
L541987	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
L541986	u7824	m529	LUKE	According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
L541969	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
L541968	u7824	m529	LUKE	Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
L541967	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
L541966	u7824	m529	LUKE	You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
L541965	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
L541964	u7824	m529	LUKE	There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
L541963	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
L541962	u7824	m529	LUKE	That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
L541961	u7826	m529	THREEPIO	I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
L541960	u7824	m529	LUKE	Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.

L544951	u7849	m531	KIRK	Where is Lt. Ilia?
L544949	u7849	m531	KIRK	Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
L544948	u7845	m531	ILIA	V'ger is that which programmed me.
L544947	u7849	m531	KIRK	Who is...'V'ger'...?
L545236	u7845	m531	ILIA	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
L545235	u7847	m531	DECKER	And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
L545108	u7847	m531	DECKER	It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
L545107	u7845	m531	ILIA	'To learn all that is learnable.'
L545106	u7847	m531	DECKER	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
L545105	u7845	m531	ILIA	As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
L545093	u7845	m531	ILIA	To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
L545092	u7847	m531	DECKER	To join, and become One with the Creator?
L545091	u7845	m531	ILIA	By the Creator.
L545090	u7847	m531	DECKER	A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
L545038	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is how V'ger will survive.
L545037	u7847	m531	DECKER	You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
L545035	u7845	m531	ILIA	The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
L545034	u7847	m531	DECKER	Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
L545012	u7845	m531	ILIA	That is logical. You may procede.
L545011	u7847	m531	DECKER	Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
L545010	u7845	m531	ILIA	When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
L545009	u7847	m531	DECKER	What does that mean?
L545008	u7845	m531	ILIA	More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
L545007	u7847	m531	DECKER	Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
L545006	u7845	m531	ILIA	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
L545005	u7847	m531	DECKER	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
L545004	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
L545003	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes.
L545002	u7845	m531	ILIA	Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
L545001	u7847	m531	DECKER	The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
L545203	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
L545202	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
L545170	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering...
L545169	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
L545168	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
L545017	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
L545016	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
L544944	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
L544943	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
L544763	u7849	m531	KIRK	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
L544762	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
L544682	u7846	m531	CHEKOV	Departure angle.
L544681	u7849	m531	KIRK	Departure angle on viewer.
L545253	u7849	m531	KIRK	Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
L545252	u7847	m531	DECKER	And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
L545251	u7849	m531	KIRK	Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
L545250	u7847	m531	DECKER	The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
L545221	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain... I'd like to go along...
L545220	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
L545209	u7849	m531	KIRK	No!
L545208	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
L545207	u7849	m531	KIRK	    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
L545167	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
L545166	u7849	m531	KIRK	Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
L545163	u7849	m531	KIRK	The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
L545162	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, what's the next move?
L544923	u7849	m531	KIRK	They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
L544922	u7847	m531	DECKER	Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
L544909	u7849	m531	KIRK	Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
L544908	u7847	m531	DECKER	The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
L544901	u7849	m531	KIRK	It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
L544900	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's taken control of the computer...!
L544899	u7849	m531	KIRK	<U>Computer off</U>!
L544868	u7847	m531	DECKER	You asked my opinion, sir.
L544867	u7849	m531	KIRK	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
L544866	u7847	m531	DECKER	That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
L544865	u7849	m531	KIRK	That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
L544864	u7847	m531	DECKER	I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
L544819	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr Decker....
L544818	u7847	m531	DECKER	Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
L544815	u7849	m531	KIRK	No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
L544814	u7847	m531	DECKER	Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
L544774	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
L544773	u7847	m531	DECKER	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
L544772	u7849	m531	KIRK	If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
L544748	u7847	m531	DECKER	Yes, sir, I'll do that.
L544747	u7849	m531	KIRK	I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
L544746	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
L544745	u7849	m531	KIRK	Granted.
L544744	u7847	m531	DECKER	Permission to speak freely, sir?
L544743	u7849	m531	KIRK	Stop competing with me, Decker!
L544742	u7847	m531	DECKER	I'm aware of that, sir.
L544741	u7849	m531	KIRK	You saved the ship.
L544740	u7847	m531	DECKER	Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
L544739	u7849	m531	KIRK	Then you acted properly, of course.
L544738	u7847	m531	DECKER	Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
L544737	u7849	m531	KIRK	Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
L544692	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
L544691	u7847	m531	DECKER	... but I still recommend further simulation study.
L544690	u7847	m531	DECKER	Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
L544689	u7849	m531	KIRK	Programming ready?
L544618	u7849	m531	KIRK	You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
L544617	u7847	m531	DECKER	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
L544616	u7849	m531	KIRK	We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
L544599	u7847	m531	DECKER	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
L544598	u7849	m531	KIRK	That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
L544596	u7847	m531	DECKER	Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
L544595	u7849	m531	KIRK	My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
L544594	u7847	m531	DECKER	May I ask Why?
L544593	u7849	m531	KIRK	Yes.
L544592	u7847	m531	DECKER	-- You, personally, are assuming command?
L544591	u7849	m531	KIRK	You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
L544590	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
L544589	u7847	m531	DECKER	You are what...?
L544588	u7849	m531	KIRK	I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
L545255	u7847	m531	DECKER	You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
L545254	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
L545217	u7847	m531	DECKER	   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
L545216	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
L545193	u7853	m531	SPOCK	V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
L545192	u7847	m531	DECKER	Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
L545161	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A tractor beam...
L545160	u7847	m531	DECKER	Forward motion, Captain...!
L545126	u7847	m531	DECKER	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
L545125	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
L544980	u7847	m531	DECKER	That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
L544979	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
L544975	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
L544974	u7847	m531	DECKER	It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
L544973	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
L544903	u7853	m531	SPOCK	This served the purpose.
L544902	u7847	m531	DECKER	We could have cut it off at the main computer...
L544858	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
L544857	u7847	m531	DECKER	They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
L544754	u7848	m531	ILIA	No.
L544753	u7847	m531	DECKER	If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
L544752	u7848	m531	ILIA	That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
L544751	u7847	m531	DECKER	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
L544750	u7848	m531	ILIA	Was he difficult?
L544712	u7847	m531	DECKER	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
L544711	u7848	m531	ILIA	Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
L544709	u7848	m531	ILIA	Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
L544708	u7847	m531	DECKER	Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
L544656	u7848	m531	ILIA	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
L544655	u7847	m531	DECKER	I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
L544642	u7848	m531	ILIA	Decker....!
L544641	u7847	m531	DECKER	Hello, Ilia.
L544870	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer, standard ahead.
L544869	u7848	m531	ILIA	Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
L544861	u7849	m531	KIRK	Opinion, Mister. Spock?
L544860	u7848	m531	ILIA	Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
L544846	u7848	m531	ILIA	Ten seconds....
L544845	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
L544844	u7848	m531	ILIA	Impact in fifteen seconds...
L544843	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Spock?
L544824	u7849	m531	KIRK	I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
L544823	u7848	m531	ILIA	Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
L544715	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
L544714	u7848	m531	ILIA	Twelve seconds...!
L544713	u7849	m531	KIRK	Time to impact...?
L544648	u7848	m531	ILIA	My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
L544647	u7849	m531	KIRK	And in you, too, Lieutenant.
L544645	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our Exec and Science Officer...
L544644	u7848	m531	ILIA	'Commander' Decker?
L544640	u7849	m531	KIRK	Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
L544639	u7848	m531	ILIA	Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
L545142	u7849	m531	KIRK	That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
L545141	u7854	m531	SULU	Clear the bridge, Captain...?
L544936	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station keeping...
L544935	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station...!
L544932	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters ahead, one third.
L544931	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
L544930	u7854	m531	SULU	Viewer ahead, sir.
L544929	u7849	m531	KIRK	Viewer ahead.
L544890	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold relative position here...
L544889	u7854	m531	SULU	One hundred kilometers...
L544888	u7849	m531	KIRK	Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
L544887	u7854	m531	SULU	We're already two settings below that, sir.
L544886	u7849	m531	KIRK	Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
L544872	u7854	m531	SULU	Aye, sir.
L544871	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
L544700	u7854	m531	SULU	Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
L544699	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
L544676	u7854	m531	SULU	Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
L544675	u7849	m531	KIRK	Hold station.
L544674	u7854	m531	SULU	Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
L544673	u7849	m531	KIRK	Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
L544575	u7854	m531	SULU	He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
L544574	u7849	m531	KIRK	I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
L544608	u7849	m531	KIRK	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
L544607	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're losing the pattern...!
L544562	u7849	m531	KIRK	Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
L544561	u7850	m531	SCOTT	The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
L544558	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
L544557	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
L544556	u7849	m531	KIRK	See that it is.  Take me over, please.
L544555	u7850	m531	SCOTT	We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
L544554	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
L544553	u7850	m531	SCOTT	Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
L545260	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
L545259	u7849	m531	KIRK	... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
L545258	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
L545257	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
L545238	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
L545237	u7849	m531	KIRK	There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
L545224	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
L545223	u7849	m531	KIRK	V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
L545206	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
L545205	u7849	m531	KIRK	The point... 
L545204	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
L545191	u7849	m531	KIRK	There is no alternative.
L545190	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
L545187	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
L545186	u7849	m531	KIRK	Not for us?
L545158	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Precisely.
L545157	u7849	m531	KIRK	The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
L545131	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
L545130	u7849	m531	KIRK	Child...!?
L545113	u7849	m531	KIRK	High mag, Mr. Sulu!
L545112	u7853	m531	SPOCK	These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
L545078	u7853	m531	SPOCK	'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
L545077	u7849	m531	KIRK	What answers?
L545076	u7853	m531	SPOCK	No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
L545075	u7849	m531	KIRK	What should you have known?
L545069	u7853	m531	SPOCK	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
L545068	u7849	m531	KIRK	Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
L545059	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
L545058	u7849	m531	KIRK	If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
L545057	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
L545056	u7849	m531	KIRK	Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
L545054	u7853	m531	SPOCK	New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
L545053	u7849	m531	KIRK	And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
L545052	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
L545050	u7849	m531	KIRK	Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
L545049	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am seeking answers, Captain.
L545048	u7849	m531	KIRK	Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
L544988	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
L544987	u7849	m531	KIRK	Spock? Concerned about his chances?
L544978	u7849	m531	KIRK	Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
L544977	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
L544976	u7849	m531	KIRK	They had a pattern to follow...
L544940	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
L544939	u7849	m531	KIRK	Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
L544915	u7849	m531	KIRK	Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
L544914	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
L544911	u7849	m531	KIRK	Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
L544910	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
L544881	u7849	m531	KIRK	Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
L544880	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
L544874	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
L544873	u7849	m531	KIRK	No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
L544863	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker... ?
L544862	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Recommend we proceede, Captain.
L544856	u7849	m531	KIRK	But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
L544855	u7853	m531	SPOCK	We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
L544854	u7849	m531	KIRK	Our... 'insignificance'?
L544853	u7853	m531	SPOCK	The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
L544850	u7849	m531	KIRK	Any reply from them?
L544849	u7853	m531	SPOCK	It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
L544827	u7849	m531	KIRK	Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
L544826	u7853	m531	SPOCK	They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
L544821	u7849	m531	KIRK	Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
L544820	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
L544810	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
L544809	u7849	m531	KIRK	Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
L544801	u7849	m531	KIRK	I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
L544800	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
L544799	u7849	m531	KIRK	Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
L544798	u7853	m531	SPOCK	... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
L544797	u7849	m531	KIRK	And whatever you sensed out here....
L544796	u7853	m531	SPOCK	I still contain fragments of my human half.
L544793	u7853	m531	SPOCK	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
L544792	u7849	m531	KIRK	Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
L544791	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
L544790	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
L544789	u7849	m531	KIRK	I want him here.  Sit down!
L544788	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
L544787	u7849	m531	KIRK	Sit down, please.
L544786	u7853	m531	SPOCK	Reporting as ordered, Captain.
L544552	u7849	m531	KIRK	I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
L544551	u7852	m531	SONAK	To you, sir?
L544550	u7849	m531	KIRK	Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
L544549	u7852	m531	SONAK	Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
L544548	u7849	m531	KIRK	Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
L544547	u7852	m531	SONAK	Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
L544546	u7849	m531	KIRK	Why aren't you on board?
L544545	u7852	m531	SONAK	Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
L544544	u7849	m531	KIRK	You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
L545201	u7849	m531	KIRK	Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
L545200	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	We're ready, sir.
L545199	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
L544732	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
L544731	u7849	m531	KIRK	That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
L544730	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
L544729	u7849	m531	KIRK	Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
L544694	u7849	m531	KIRK	Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
L544693	u7851	m531	SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE	Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
L545182	u7854	m531	SULU	Tractor beam remains constant...
L545181	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
L545115	u7855	m531	UHURA	<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
L545114	u7854	m531	SULU	The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
L545015	u7854	m531	SULU	Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
L545014	u7855	m531	UHURA	Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
L544706	u7855	m531	UHURA	Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
L544705	u7854	m531	SULU	Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
L544670	u7854	m531	SULU	Helm ready, sir.
L544669	u7855	m531	UHURA	Dock control reports ready, sir.
L544634	u7854	m531	SULU	Dock signals clear, Captain.
L544633	u7855	m531	UHURA	Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
L556913	u7982	m541	BRAD	Nope.  Never. 
L556912	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
L556910	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
L556909	u7982	m541	BRAD	No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
L556908	u7986	m541	GUS	Brad?
L556907	u7982	m541	BRAD	Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
L556906	u7986	m541	GUS	Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
L556905	u7982	m541	BRAD	Brad.
L556904	u7986	m541	GUS	Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
L556901	u7986	m541	GUS	What? What did you tell me?
L556900	u7982	m541	BRAD	Aha! What'd I tell ya!
L556899	u7986	m541	GUS	There's no vodka in it.
L556898	u7982	m541	BRAD	Not enough vodka in it.
L556897	u7986	m541	GUS	Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
L556896	u7982	m541	BRAD	S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
L556894	u7986	m541	GUS	TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
L556893	u7982	m541	BRAD	Tuesday.
L556892	u7986	m541	GUS	Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
L556891	u7982	m541	BRAD	Mr. Roebush?
L556890	u7986	m541	GUS	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
L556889	u7982	m541	BRAD	What are you talkin' about?
L556888	u7986	m541	GUS	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
L556887	u7982	m541	BRAD	What?
L556886	u7986	m541	GUS	Buddy, are we in trouble.
L556885	u7982	m541	BRAD	Yeah? What do you want?
L556720	u7983	m541	CLARK	The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
L556719	u7982	m541	BRAD	The kid needs a man to show him --
L556718	u7983	m541	CLARK	I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
L556717	u7982	m541	BRAD	For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
L556716	u7983	m541	CLARK	Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
L556711	u7982	m541	BRAD	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
L556710	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
L556709	u7982	m541	BRAD	All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
L556708	u7983	m541	CLARK	I seem to be.
L556707	u7982	m541	BRAD	Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
L556636	u7982	m541	BRAD	"Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  ""See"" I mean,  Hahaha!"
L556635	u7983	m541	CLARK	Brad Wilson.
L556634	u7982	m541	BRAD	Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
L557316	u7988	m541	LANA	Anyday...
L557315	u7983	m541	CLARK	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
L557314	u7988	m541	LANA	I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
L557031	u7988	m541	LANA	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
L557030	u7983	m541	CLARK	No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
L556932	u7988	m541	LANA	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
L556931	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I always loved porch swings.
L556883	u7983	m541	CLARK	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
L556882	u7988	m541	LANA	Well, aren't you excited?
L556881	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh-huh.
L556880	u7988	m541	LANA	He really was!
L556861	u7983	m541	CLARK	Can I help?
L556860	u7988	m541	LANA	The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
L556855	u7988	m541	LANA	Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
L556854	u7983	m541	CLARK	Call me.
L556853	u7988	m541	LANA	No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
L556852	u7983	m541	CLARK	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
L556851	u7988	m541	LANA	That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
L556850	u7988	m541	LANA	No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
L556849	u7983	m541	CLARK	Old ties are hard to cut.
L556848	u7988	m541	LANA	I can never get a way from it.
L556846	u7983	m541	CLARK	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
L556845	u7988	m541	LANA	So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
L556844	u7983	m541	CLARK	Me neither...
L556843	u7988	m541	LANA	Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
L556842	u7988	m541	LANA	Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
L556841	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
L556840	u7988	m541	LANA	No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
L556839	u7983	m541	CLARK	No, thanks.
L556838	u7988	m541	LANA	Peanut butter and jelly.
L556835	u7983	m541	CLARK	I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
L556834	u7988	m541	LANA	No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
L556833	u7983	m541	CLARK	There's a lot of choices here.
L556832	u7988	m541	LANA	And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
L556827	u7988	m541	LANA	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
L556826	u7983	m541	CLARK	Me??
L556825	u7988	m541	LANA	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
L556824	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
L556823	u7988	m541	LANA	Some people don't think it's healthy.
L556822	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I haven't done this in years.
L556706	u7988	m541	LANA	I mean him.
L556705	u7983	m541	CLARK	But all he had was chocolate milk.
L556704	u7988	m541	LANA	It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
L556703	u7983	m541	CLARK	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
L556702	u7988	m541	LANA	I just can't stand this.
L556671	u7988	m541	LANA	"I thought ""Clark Kent has a really nice voice."" You didn't even know I was there."
L556670	u7983	m541	CLARK	You thought that?
L556669	u7988	m541	LANA	That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
L556667	u7983	m541	CLARK	Oh...I came close once.
L556666	u7988	m541	LANA	You...um...you never got married?
L556663	u7988	m541	LANA	Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
L556662	u7983	m541	CLARK	Who?
L556661	u7988	m541	LANA	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
L556660	u7983	m541	CLARK	But Lana, you could --
L556659	u7988	m541	LANA	No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
L556658	u7983	m541	CLARK	I didn't --
L556657	u7988	m541	LANA	Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
L556656	u7983	m541	CLARK	Too much mayonnaise?
L556655	u7988	m541	LANA	You know what's the problem?
L556654	u7988	m541	LANA	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
L556653	u7983	m541	CLARK	It sure is.
L556652	u7988	m541	LANA	And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
L556647	u7983	m541	CLARK	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
L556646	u7988	m541	LANA	You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
L556638	u7983	m541	CLARK	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
L556637	u7988	m541	LANA	"I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  ""Would you dance with me?"""
L556625	u7988	m541	LANA	For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
L556624	u7983	m541	CLARK	You're welcome...??
L556623	u7988	m541	LANA	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
L556622	u7983	m541	CLARK	You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
L556619	u7983	m541	CLARK	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
L556618	u7988	m541	LANA	You look wonderful.
L556617	u7988	m541	LANA	Clark.
L556616	u7983	m541	CLARK	Lana Lang. How great to see you.
L557351	u7983	m541	CLARK	I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
L557350	u7992	m541	PERRY	Kent!
L557349	u7983	m541	CLARK	Uh...excuse me, folks...
L556529	u7983	m541	CLARK	Oh. You're going away.
L556528	u7992	m541	PERRY	-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
L556517	u7983	m541	CLARK	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
L556516	u7992	m541	PERRY	I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
L556501	u7992	m541	PERRY	Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
L556500	u7983	m541	CLARK	Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
L556493	u7992	m541	PERRY	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
L556492	u7983	m541	CLARK	Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
L557313	u7983	m541	CLARK	Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
L557312	u7993	m541	RICKY	Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
L556940	u7993	m541	RICKY	Could you get me Superman's autograph?
L556939	u7983	m541	CLARK	Sure.
L556938	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
L556937	u7983	m541	CLARK	We get together sometimes.
L556936	u7993	m541	RICKY	Do you really know Superman?
L556879	u7983	m541	CLARK	What!
L556878	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
L556830	u7993	m541	RICKY	Mom and I do this all the time.
L556829	u7983	m541	CLARK	Well...  Not quite like this.
L557336	u7989	m541	LOIS	Oh?
L557335	u7983	m541	CLARK	Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
L557334	u7989	m541	LOIS	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
L557333	u7983	m541	CLARK	You're the best, Lois.
L556519	u7989	m541	LOIS	Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
L556518	u7983	m541	CLARK	So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
L556511	u7983	m541	CLARK	Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
L556510	u7989	m541	LOIS	Say!
L556509	u7983	m541	CLARK	Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
L556577	u7987	m541	JIMMY	You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
L556576	u7983	m541	CLARK	What are you doing?
L556575	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
L556564	u7983	m541	CLARK	At one o'clock in the morning?
L556563	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
L556562	u7983	m541	CLARK	What's that?
L556561	u7987	m541	JIMMY	The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
L556560	u7983	m541	CLARK	Mmmmm . . .
L556559	u7987	m541	JIMMY	But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
L556506	u7987	m541	JIMMY	I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
L556505	u7983	m541	CLARK	It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
L556462	u7986	m541	GUS	What about this week's check?
L556461	u7984	m541	CLERK	You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
L556460	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
L556459	u7984	m541	CLERK	Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
L556458	u7986	m541	GUS	I know, I'm the fault.
L556457	u7984	m541	CLERK	Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
L556456	u7986	m541	GUS	"Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? ""Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!"" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet."
L556455	u7984	m541	CLERK	The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
L556454	u7986	m541	GUS	Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
L556453	u7984	m541	CLERK	A television set?
L556452	u7986	m541	GUS	They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
L556451	u7984	m541	CLERK	Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
L556450	u7986	m541	GUS	Thirty-five.
L556449	u7984	m541	CLERK	Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
L556448	u7986	m541	GUS	Nope, but --
L556447	u7984	m541	CLERK	Dishwasher? Any luck?
L556446	u7986	m541	GUS	Kitchen. . . Technician
L556445	u7984	m541	CLERK	What kind?
L556444	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah.
L556443	u7984	m541	CLERK	Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
L556442	u7986	m541	GUS	Gus Gorman.
L556441	u7984	m541	CLERK	Name?
L556726	u7986	m541	GUS	Say who?
L556725	u7985	m541	FRED	The boss wants to see you.
L556724	u7986	m541	GUS	Say what?
L556723	u7985	m541	FRED	Gus?
L556555	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah. A raise . .
L556554	u7985	m541	FRED	Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
L556553	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
L556552	u7985	m541	FRED	Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
L556550	u7986	m541	GUS	One.  And a half.
L556549	u7985	m541	FRED	How many sugars?
L556548	u7985	m541	FRED	They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
L556547	u7986	m541	GUS	So where is all them half-centses?
L556546	u7985	m541	FRED	No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
L556545	u7986	m541	GUS	Who gets it, the company?
L556544	u7985	m541	FRED	They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
L556543	u7986	m541	GUS	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
L556542	u7985	m541	FRED	Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
L556541	u7986	m541	GUS	I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
L556540	u7985	m541	FRED	That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
L556539	u7986	m541	GUS	First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
L556538	u7985	m541	FRED	First paycheck?
L556537	u7986	m541	GUS	Sonofagun! Look at this here!
L557240	u7994	m541	ROSS	Join the party, genius! Come on up!
L557239	u7986	m541	GUS	Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
L557211	u7994	m541	ROSS	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
L557210	u7986	m541	GUS	You want to mess with Superman?
L557168	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
L557167	u7994	m541	ROSS	Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
L557166	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
L557165	u7994	m541	ROSS	Can you do that?
L557164	u7986	m541	GUS	Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
L557163	u7994	m541	ROSS	But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
L557162	u7994	m541	ROSS	Exactly. Stoned mother.
L557161	u7986	m541	GUS	Stone mutha.
L557160	u7994	m541	ROSS	"Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking ""get-down hot-cha daddy-o"" whatever you called it."
L557159	u7986	m541	GUS	I told you it wasn't no jive.
L557158	u7994	m541	ROSS	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
L557157	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah? How's it look?
L557126	u7994	m541	ROSS	Tell me more...
L557125	u7986	m541	GUS	Anything.
L557124	u7994	m541	ROSS	What will it get me?
L557123	u7986	m541	GUS	Everything.
L557122	u7994	m541	ROSS	What will it do?
L557121	u7986	m541	GUS	I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
L557120	u7994	m541	ROSS	You designed it?
L557119	u7986	m541	GUS	Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
L557118	u7994	m541	ROSS	We've already got some.
L557117	u7986	m541	GUS	A computer.
L557116	u7994	m541	ROSS	For what?
L557115	u7994	m541	ROSS	A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
L557114	u7994	m541	ROSS	What do you want?
L557113	u7986	m541	GUS	Fair's fair.
L557112	u7994	m541	ROSS	Is this whitemail?
L557111	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
L557110	u7994	m541	ROSS	Is this blackmail?
L557109	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
L557108	u7994	m541	ROSS	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
L557107	u7986	m541	GUS	Now...when do I get a taste?
L557105	u7986	m541	GUS	The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
L557104	u7994	m541	ROSS	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
L557103	u7986	m541	GUS	Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
L557102	u7994	m541	ROSS	Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
L557101	u7986	m541	GUS	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
L557100	u7994	m541	ROSS	And then shut down the pipe lines.
L557096	u7994	m541	ROSS	You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
L557095	u7986	m541	GUS	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
L557094	u7994	m541	ROSS	And do nothing. Just sit there.
L557091	u7994	m541	ROSS	Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
L557090	u7986	m541	GUS	They ain't got captains?
L557089	u7994	m541	ROSS	Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
L557081	u7986	m541	GUS	Huh?
L557080	u7994	m541	ROSS	KRYPTONITE!
L557079	u7986	m541	GUS	He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
L557017	u7986	m541	GUS	Greed!  Let me tell you something---
L557016	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
L557015	u7986	m541	GUS	That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
L557014	u7994	m541	ROSS	God, that's what I keep you for.
L557013	u7986	m541	GUS	Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
L557010	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
L557009	u7986	m541	GUS	It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
L556983	u7994	m541	ROSS	What are you talking about, fella?
L556982	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...what channel were you watching?
L556981	u7994	m541	ROSS	I did. isn't it neat-o?
L556980	u7986	m541	GUS	Turn on the T.V.
L556979	u7994	m541	ROSS	Just the man I wanted to see!
L556978	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey, boss.
L556816	u7986	m541	GUS	"Not ""What."" Don't need a genius to figure out ""what."" Need a genius to figure out ""where.""  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into."
L556815	u7994	m541	ROSS	What?
L556814	u7986	m541	GUS	"First question got to be ""Where."""
L556813	u7994	m541	ROSS	When?
L556812	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
L556811	u7994	m541	ROSS	Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
L556786	u7994	m541	ROSS	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
L556785	u7986	m541	GUS	How do you do that?
L556779	u7986	m541	GUS	That what they call you?
L556778	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
L556775	u7986	m541	GUS	Me? How?
L556774	u7994	m541	ROSS	"A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... ""It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail.""  And you are going to do it for me."
L556773	u7986	m541	GUS	But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
L556768	u7994	m541	ROSS	Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
L556767	u7986	m541	GUS	Wipe 'em out?
L556766	u7994	m541	ROSS	Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
L556765	u7986	m541	GUS	Columbia.
L556764	u7994	m541	ROSS	Columbia.
L556763	u7986	m541	GUS	Which country?
L556762	u7994	m541	ROSS	But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
L556761	u7986	m541	GUS	Decaffeinated too?
L556760	u7994	m541	ROSS	Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
L556758	u7994	m541	ROSS	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
L556757	u7986	m541	GUS	Man, what is this?
L556756	u7994	m541	ROSS	I don't think you understand.
L556755	u7986	m541	GUS	Black or regular?
L556754	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
L556753	u7986	m541	GUS	I'm tryin' to.
L556752	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
L556748	u7986	m541	GUS	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
L556747	u7994	m541	ROSS	Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
L556746	u7986	m541	GUS	Or socks.
L556745	u7994	m541	ROSS	I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
L556744	u7986	m541	GUS	Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
L556743	u7994	m541	ROSS	Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
L556742	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...
L556741	u7994	m541	ROSS	"Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- ""dig where you're comin' from.""  You want to be rich, right?"
L556740	u7986	m541	GUS	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
L556739	u7994	m541	ROSS	You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
L556738	u7994	m541	ROSS	Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
L556737	u7986	m541	GUS	Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
L557300	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
L557299	u7986	m541	GUS	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
L557298	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Thanks.  Let's go
L557293	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Just a second.
L557292	u7986	m541	GUS	Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
L557291	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No...I just have a little stop to make.
L557290	u7986	m541	GUS	We back in Metropolis?
L557289	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
L557288	u7986	m541	GUS	We gonna crash?
L557287	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No, we're just going down.
L557286	u7986	m541	GUS	Watch out for them air pockets!
L557285	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
L557284	u7986	m541	GUS	I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
L557283	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, you're perfectly safe.
L557282	u7986	m541	GUS	Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
L557281	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	How you doing down there?
L557099	u7997	m541	VERA	Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
L557098	u7986	m541	GUS	I know, by computers.
L557093	u7986	m541	GUS	And do what?
L557092	u7997	m541	VERA	You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
L556803	u7986	m541	GUS	What she call you?
L556802	u7997	m541	VERA	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
L556801	u7986	m541	GUS	Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
L556777	u7997	m541	VERA	Sister! I'm his sister!
L556776	u7986	m541	GUS	Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
L556796	u7987	m541	JIMMY	It was hot!
L556795	u7992	m541	PERRY	You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
L556794	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Why do I have to do this?
L556525	u7987	m541	JIMMY	A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
L556524	u7992	m541	PERRY	What about you?
L556523	u7987	m541	JIMMY	What about me?
L556522	u7992	m541	PERRY	All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
L556487	u7992	m541	PERRY	A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
L556486	u7987	m541	JIMMY	I didn't have my camera with me.
L556485	u7992	m541	PERRY	You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
L556482	u7987	m541	JIMMY	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
L556481	u7992	m541	PERRY	Who's the other woman?
L556479	u7987	m541	JIMMY	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
L556478	u7992	m541	PERRY	Who is she?
L557065	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
L557064	u7988	m541	LANA	Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
L557063	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
L557062	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
L557061	u7988	m541	LANA	But the bridge...
L557060	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	There's no rush.
L557057	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	You just did, with that great dinner.
L557056	u7988	m541	LANA	He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
L557039	u7988	m541	LANA	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
L557038	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
L556873	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
L556872	u7988	m541	LANA	And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
L556871	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	We've already met.
L556870	u7988	m541	LANA	Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
L556869	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Anytime.
L556868	u7988	m541	LANA	Thank ...you.
L556867	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
L556866	u7988	m541	LANA	Ricky?  Where...what...
L557332	u7989	m541	LOIS	I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
L557331	u7992	m541	PERRY	Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
L556527	u7992	m541	PERRY	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
L556526	u7989	m541	LOIS	Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
L556504	u7989	m541	LOIS	Whoopee.
L556503	u7992	m541	PERRY	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
L556502	u7989	m541	LOIS	What terrific story?
L556484	u7989	m541	LOIS	The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
L556483	u7992	m541	PERRY	The picture looks blurry.
L557245	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
L557244	u7990	m541	LORELEI	But the other night...
L557243	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I don't know you, lady.
L557144	u7990	m541	LORELEI	It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
L557143	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
L557142	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
L557141	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
L557140	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
L557139	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Tell me.
L557138	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Lots of things...
L557137	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
L557136	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
L557135	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
L557134	u7996	m541	SUPERMAN	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
L557133	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I thought you'd never get here.
L557266	u7990	m541	LORELEI	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
L557265	u7997	m541	VERA	I can't! It's out of control!
L557234	u7990	m541	LORELEI	He can have mine. Anytime.
L557233	u7997	m541	VERA	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
L557232	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Oh, Superman!
L557230	u7990	m541	LORELEI	In other words, push this red button.
L557229	u7997	m541	VERA	You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
L557226	u7997	m541	VERA	Superman. The boy you left behind.
L557225	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Gus?
L557224	u7997	m541	VERA	Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
L557217	u7997	m541	VERA	Where do you usually find a light switch?
L557216	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Where's the light switch?
L557215	u7997	m541	VERA	Turn on the light.
L557214	u7990	m541	LORELEI	I can't see anything.
L557076	u7990	m541	LORELEI	And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
L557075	u7997	m541	VERA	At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining. ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
L557003	u7997	m541	VERA	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
L557002	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Hey, I know a lot of things!
L557001	u7997	m541	VERA	How would you know?
L556968	u7997	m541	VERA	"Energy! And when they say ""Energy"" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped."
L556967	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Diet soda?
L556966	u7997	m541	VERA	Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
L556686	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
L556685	u7997	m541	VERA	If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
L556682	u7997	m541	VERA	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
L556681	u7990	m541	LORELEI	Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
L557347	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	There is no handle! You just push a button.
L557346	u7992	m541	PERRY	Where's the handle?
L557345	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
L556793	u7992	m541	PERRY	Why do I have to do this?
L556792	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
L556535	u7992	m541	PERRY	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
L556534	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	By hand. Like the pioneers did.
L556533	u7992	m541	PERRY	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
L556532	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, the next number, please?
L556499	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	You've got to pick three more numbers.
L556498	u7992	m541	PERRY	Okay? Goodbye.
L556497	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	53!
L556496	u7992	m541	PERRY	53.
L556491	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
L556490	u7992	m541	PERRY	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
L556489	u7991	m541	MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
L556695	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
L556694	u7994	m541	ROSS	Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
L556684	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	Hello.
L556683	u7994	m541	ROSS	Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
L556680	u7994	m541	ROSS	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
L556679	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	"I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up.""  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!"
L556676	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
L556675	u7994	m541	ROSS	Missing????
L556674	u7995	m541	SIMPSON	85,000 dollars.
L557258	u7994	m541	ROSS	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
L557257	u7997	m541	VERA	Yes! This time we got it right!
L557255	u7997	m541	VERA	Don't bet on it!
L557254	u7994	m541	ROSS	He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
L557223	u7997	m541	VERA	Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
L557222	u7994	m541	ROSS	He's the only one who can operate this --
L557221	u7997	m541	VERA	Who needs Gus?
L557220	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
L557219	u7997	m541	VERA	Come on, let's give it a dry run.
L557128	u7997	m541	VERA	Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
L557127	u7994	m541	ROSS	That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
L557085	u7997	m541	VERA	We can get to work on that oil!
L557084	u7994	m541	ROSS	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
L557083	u7997	m541	VERA	A normal person.
L557082	u7994	m541	ROSS	Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
L557012	u7994	m541	ROSS	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
L557011	u7997	m541	VERA	So?
L557008	u7994	m541	ROSS	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
L557007	u7997	m541	VERA	Where did it come from?
L557006	u7994	m541	ROSS	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
L557005	u7997	m541	VERA	What's wrong?
L557004	u7994	m541	ROSS	Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
L556996	u7997	m541	VERA	How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
L556995	u7994	m541	ROSS	Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
L556992	u7997	m541	VERA	Don't cry, Bubba.
L556991	u7994	m541	ROSS	He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
L556977	u7994	m541	ROSS	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
L556976	u7997	m541	VERA	Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
L556975	u7994	m541	ROSS	We already have a super-tanker.
L556974	u7997	m541	VERA	Small potatoes.
L556971	u7994	m541	ROSS	TOMORROW THE OIL!
L556970	u7997	m541	VERA	Today coffee----
L556969	u7994	m541	ROSS	You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
L556818	u7994	m541	ROSS	Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
L556817	u7997	m541	VERA	Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
L556807	u7994	m541	ROSS	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
L556806	u7997	m541	VERA	She's not his mama either.
L556800	u7997	m541	VERA	Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
L556799	u7994	m541	ROSS	Computers talk to other computers, right?
L556784	u7997	m541	VERA	Blizzards! Heat waves!
L556783	u7994	m541	ROSS	Storms! Floods!
L556782	u7997	m541	VERA	It could make weather!
L556781	u7994	m541	ROSS	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
L556692	u7994	m541	ROSS	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
L556691	u7997	m541	VERA	I don't kiss.
L556678	u7994	m541	ROSS	Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
L556677	u7997	m541	VERA	That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
L558690	u7998	m542	CLARK	She'll be fine.
L558689	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Are you okay?
L557999	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
L557998	u7998	m542	CLARK	Hostages?
L557997	u8001	m542	JIMMY	So far the hostages are unharmed.
L557996	u7998	m542	CLARK	Anybody been hurt?
L557985	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Yeah. I'll check.
L557984	u7998	m542	CLARK	Jimmy, how's the -
L558703	u8004	m542	LOIS	Everything on it.
L558702	u7998	m542	CLARK	Everything on it?
L558701	u8004	m542	LOIS	Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
L558700	u7998	m542	CLARK	You do?
L558699	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
L558698	u7998	m542	CLARK	I'll try to remember that . . .
L558697	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
L558696	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I really don't see why --
L558695	u8004	m542	LOIS	. . . Superman?. . . . .
L558693	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
L558692	u7998	m542	CLARK	Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
L558691	u8004	m542	LOIS	See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
L558684	u7998	m542	CLARK	I like worrying about you.
L558683	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Please don't tell me ""You'll find somebody else someday."" Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me."
L558682	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, someday --
L558681	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
L558680	u7998	m542	CLARK	What else could I do?
L558679	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say ""Help. Come quick. Now"" I know who you'd have to pick."
L558678	u7998	m542	CLARK	They?
L558677	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
L558676	u7998	m542	CLARK	You're not selfish at all.
L558675	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, ""It's like being married to a doctor,"" I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, "" could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . """
L558674	u7998	m542	CLARK	I'm sorry.
L558673	u8004	m542	LOIS	"I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I ""listened to the voices of  reason"" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?"
L558671	u8004	m542	LOIS	Never closed my eyes.
L558670	u7998	m542	CLARK	Sleep well?
L558669	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh, hi.
L558668	u7998	m542	CLARK	Hi.
L558495	u7998	m542	CLARK	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
L558494	u8004	m542	LOIS	Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
L558493	u7998	m542	CLARK	I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
L558492	u8004	m542	LOIS	But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
L558491	u7998	m542	CLARK	I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
L558481	u7998	m542	CLARK	I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
L558480	u8004	m542	LOIS	I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
L558479	u7998	m542	CLARK	Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
L558478	u8004	m542	LOIS	Let's get you inside . . . .
L558477	u7998	m542	CLARK	Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
L558473	u7998	m542	CLARK	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
L558472	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
L558450	u7998	m542	CLARK	Say you love me.
L558449	u8004	m542	LOIS	You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
L558286	u8004	m542	LOIS	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
L558285	u7998	m542	CLARK	Let's go to my place.
L558284	u7998	m542	CLARK	Let's go to my place.
L558283	u8004	m542	LOIS	I want to.
L558282	u7998	m542	CLARK	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
L558281	u8004	m542	LOIS	What's happening. Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
L558280	u7998	m542	CLARK	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
L558279	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm listening.
L558278	u7998	m542	CLARK	We'd better talk.
L558277	u8004	m542	LOIS	I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
L558274	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
L558273	u7998	m542	CLARK	I didn't think I wanted to.
L558272	u8004	m542	LOIS	Maybe you wanted to.
L558269	u7998	m542	CLARK	Oh come on, that's ridic -
L558268	u8004	m542	LOIS	I was right. you are Superman.
L558267	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I . . .
L558266	u8004	m542	LOIS	It's true. It's true.
L558248	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
L558247	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh Clark, no!
L558238	u7998	m542	CLARK	What??
L558237	u8004	m542	LOIS	Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
L558236	u7998	m542	CLARK	How could you win a crazy bet like --
L558235	u8004	m542	LOIS	Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
L558234	u7998	m542	CLARK	You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
L558233	u7998	m542	CLARK	No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
L558232	u8004	m542	LOIS	Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
L558231	u7998	m542	CLARK	Who ????
L558229	u7998	m542	CLARK	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
L558228	u8004	m542	LOIS	Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
L558227	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
L558223	u8004	m542	LOIS	And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
L558222	u7998	m542	CLARK	Superman? Oh, was he here?
L558221	u8004	m542	LOIS	I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
L558220	u7998	m542	CLARK	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
L558219	u8004	m542	LOIS	Where were you?
L558208	u8004	m542	LOIS	Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
L558207	u7998	m542	CLARK	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
L558206	u8004	m542	LOIS	Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
L558205	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, you're amazing.
L558204	u8004	m542	LOIS	Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
L558199	u8004	m542	LOIS	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
L558198	u7998	m542	CLARK	I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
L558195	u8004	m542	LOIS	"Mr. Smith -  -- the ""complimentary couch."""
L558194	u7998	m542	CLARK	I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
L558193	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
L558192	u7998	m542	CLARK	"A ""complimentary corsage."""
L558189	u8004	m542	LOIS	Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
L558187	u7998	m542	CLARK	Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
L558186	u8004	m542	LOIS	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
L558185	u7998	m542	CLARK	'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
L558179	u8004	m542	LOIS	In July???
L558178	u7998	m542	CLARK	It is kinda romantic.
L558089	u8004	m542	LOIS	Of course, that's what friends are for.
L558088	u7998	m542	CLARK	Really?
L558087	u8004	m542	LOIS	Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
L558085	u8004	m542	LOIS	Be my guest.
L558084	u7998	m542	CLARK	Maybe I could try --
L558083	u8004	m542	LOIS	Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
L558082	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
L558080	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
L558079	u7998	m542	CLARK	Actually, yes.
L558078	u8004	m542	LOIS	Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
L558077	u7998	m542	CLARK	I do?
L558076	u8004	m542	LOIS	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
L558075	u7998	m542	CLARK	I don't?
L558072	u8004	m542	LOIS	Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
L558071	u7998	m542	CLARK	One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
L558070	u8004	m542	LOIS	Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
L558069	u7998	m542	CLARK	Uh. . .
L558068	u8004	m542	LOIS	When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
L558067	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, what are you doing?
L558066	u8004	m542	LOIS	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
L558065	u7998	m542	CLARK	Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
L558064	u8004	m542	LOIS	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
L558063	u7998	m542	CLARK	Lois, I usually do.
L558009	u7998	m542	CLARK	No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
L558008	u8007	m542	PERRY	No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
L558007	u7998	m542	CLARK	Gee. But --
L558006	u8007	m542	PERRY	The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
L558005	u7998	m542	CLARK	What??
L558004	u8007	m542	PERRY	Does she know about it? She's in it!
L558003	u7998	m542	CLARK	Does Lois know about this yet?
L558002	u8007	m542	PERRY	That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
L558001	u7998	m542	CLARK	But . . ..that's terrible!
L557993	u8007	m542	PERRY	Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
L557992	u7998	m542	CLARK	Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
L557991	u8007	m542	PERRY	Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
L557990	u7998	m542	CLARK	Uh...home...
L557989	u8007	m542	PERRY	Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?

L558527	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
L558526	u8007	m542	PERRY	I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
L557995	u8007	m542	PERRY	He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
L557994	u8001	m542	JIMMY	A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
L557986	u8001	m542	JIMMY	Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
L558439	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Yes.
L558438	u8002	m542	LARA	And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
L558437	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
L558436	u8002	m542	LARA	Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
L558435	u8002	m542	LARA	Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
L558434	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Yes, but it's not all I feel.
L558433	u8002	m542	LARA	You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
L558432	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
L558431	u8002	m542	LARA	You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
L558328	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	I didn't ask her anything . . .
L558327	u8002	m542	LARA	The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
L558326	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	I asked the right question.
L558325	u8002	m542	LARA	The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
L558324	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	No possibility for parole?
L558323	u8002	m542	LARA	And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
L558322	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Sensible enough.
L558321	u8002	m542	LARA	The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
L558320	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	My kind of people.
L558319	u8002	m542	LARA	"For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as ""criminals."""

L558385	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	So --  I hope you like it.
L558360	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
L558359	u8004	m542	LOIS	I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
L558358	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	You must be freezing.
L558054	u8004	m542	LOIS	The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
L558053	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
L558052	u8004	m542	LOIS	Superman! The --
L558666	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
L558665	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
L558664	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
L558663	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
L558662	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
L558661	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
L558652	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
L558651	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
L558650	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
L558649	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
L558648	u8012	m542	SUPERMAN	Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
L558642	u8014	m542	ZOD	Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
L558641	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
L558621	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Put down Lex Luthor?
L558620	u8014	m542	ZOD	Put down Lex Luthor !
L558619	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	North. Keep going North!
L558618	u8014	m542	ZOD	Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
L558617	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
L558614	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Cuba.
L558613	u8014	m542	ZOD	What more?
L558608	u8005	m542	LUTHOR	Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
L558607	u8014	m542	ZOD	Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
L558603	u8014	m542	ZOD	He ran in fear from us . . .
L558488	u8014	m542	ZOD	Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
L558487	u8008	m542	PRESIDENT	You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
L558486	u8014	m542	ZOD	Who is this . . . Superman?
L558463	u8014	m542	ZOD	Zod.  Zod.
L558462	u8008	m542	PRESIDENT	I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
L558461	u8014	m542	ZOD	Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
L558458	u8014	m542	ZOD	It will. Starting with your own.
L558021	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
L558020	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	Yes, but will you honor it?
L558019	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
L558018	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
L558017	u8011	m542	SPOKESMAN	In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
L558016	u8010	m542	SECOND REPORTER	And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
L558640	u8013	m542	URSA	Super-sucker .  For once, Lex Luthor was right.
L558639	u8014	m542	ZOD	Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
L558629	u8014	m542	ZOD	We must combine our strength.
L558628	u8013	m542	URSA	General --- ?
L558577	u8014	m542	ZOD	Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
L558576	u8013	m542	URSA	He's captured Non!
L558575	u8013	m542	URSA	Sentimental idiot.
L558574	u8014	m542	ZOD	He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
L558573	u8013	m542	URSA	Yes?
L558572	u8014	m542	ZOD	"This ""super"" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness."
L558499	u8014	m542	ZOD	And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
L558498	u8013	m542	URSA	You are master of all you survey.
L558446	u8014	m542	ZOD	Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
L558445	u8013	m542	URSA	Look, they need a machine to fly.
L558256	u8014	m542	ZOD	Stay. I will come to you.
L558255	u8013	m542	URSA	What shall we do now?
L558254	u8014	m542	ZOD	So this is the planet Houston . . .
L558150	u8014	m542	ZOD	And I will lead.
L558148	u8014	m542	ZOD	Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
L558146	u8014	m542	ZOD	Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
L558145	u8013	m542	URSA	Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
L558056	u8013	m542	URSA	Free!
L558055	u8014	m542	ZOD	Free!
L559283	u8015	m543	CLARK	Lacy. . . I . . .
L559282	u8018	m543	LACY	Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
L559281	u8015	m543	CLARK	You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
L559280	u8018	m543	LACY	You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
L559279	u8015	m543	CLARK	Like me?
L559278	u8018	m543	LACY	Any more like you back home, Clark?
L559277	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not so sure you do.
L559276	u8018	m543	LACY	You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
L559275	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm sorry to see you go.
L559274	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
L559110	u8018	m543	LACY	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
L559109	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I'm really sorry.
L559107	u8018	m543	LACY	Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
L559106	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
L559096	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. . . !
L559095	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . my . . .
L559093	u8015	m543	CLARK	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
L559092	u8018	m543	LACY	I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
L559076	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
L559075	u8018	m543	LACY	Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
L559066	u8018	m543	LACY	. . . Let me get my purse.
L559065	u8015	m543	CLARK	Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
L559024	u8018	m543	LACY	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
L559023	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gee, I don't think . . .
L559022	u8018	m543	LACY	I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
L559021	u8015	m543	CLARK	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
L559020	u8018	m543	LACY	Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
L559019	u8015	m543	CLARK	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
L559018	u8018	m543	LACY	He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
L559011	u8015	m543	CLARK	If you say so. Here goes.
L559010	u8018	m543	LACY	Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
L559009	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
L559008	u8015	m543	CLARK	Maybe I should sit this one out.
L558916	u8015	m543	CLARK	Don't worry, I've got you.
L558915	u8018	m543	LACY	I feel kind of light-headed . . .
L558914	u8018	m543	LACY	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
L558913	u8015	m543	CLARK	That sounds kind of pessimistic.
L558912	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
L558911	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
L558910	u8018	m543	LACY	What about here?
L558909	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
L558908	u8018	m543	LACY	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
L558907	u8015	m543	CLARK	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
L558906	u8018	m543	LACY	My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
L558905	u8015	m543	CLARK	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
L558904	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
L558899	u8018	m543	LACY	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
L558898	u8015	m543	CLARK	I've never been in a place like this before.
L558893	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
L558892	u8015	m543	CLARK	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
L558891	u8018	m543	LACY	You're late. Very late.
L558845	u8018	m543	LACY	Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
L558844	u8015	m543	CLARK	They make my eyes itch.
L558843	u8018	m543	LACY	That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
L558842	u8015	m543	CLARK	And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
L558841	u8018	m543	LACY	But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
L558840	u8015	m543	CLARK	I really don't think . . .
L558839	u8018	m543	LACY	It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
L559290	u8015	m543	CLARK	Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
L559289	u8021	m543	LOIS	It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
L559191	u8015	m543	CLARK	You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
L559190	u8021	m543	LOIS	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
L559189	u8015	m543	CLARK	Superman? Has something happened to him?
L559187	u8021	m543	LOIS	You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
L559186	u8015	m543	CLARK	It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
L559151	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
L559150	u8015	m543	CLARK	. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
L559070	u8015	m543	CLARK	Politely?
L559069	u8021	m543	LOIS	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
L559068	u8015	m543	CLARK	'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
L558851	u8021	m543	LOIS	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
L558850	u8015	m543	CLARK	Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
L558812	u8021	m543	LOIS	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
L558811	u8015	m543	CLARK	The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
L558801	u8021	m543	LOIS	Clark . . . wait!
L558800	u8015	m543	CLARK	I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
L558799	u8021	m543	LOIS	No Paris?
L558777	u8021	m543	LOIS	Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
L558776	u8015	m543	CLARK	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
L558775	u8021	m543	LOIS	Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
L559175	u8020	m543	LEX	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
L559174	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
L559005	u8020	m543	LEX	If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
L559004	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And what do we get out of it?
L559001	u8020	m543	LEX	Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
L559000	u8016	m543	HOWLER	And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
L558999	u8020	m543	LEX	Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
L558997	u8020	m543	LEX	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
L558996	u8016	m543	HOWLER	But Superman isn't an average man.
L558995	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
L558994	u8016	m543	HOWLER	Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
L559310	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
L559309	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
L559308	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Go on . . .
L559307	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
L559306	u8017	m543	JEREMY	I'll try. . .
L559305	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
L559304	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Awesome!
L558967	u8017	m543	JEREMY	N-no...I mean...you bet.
L558966	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
L558963	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Absolutely!
L558962	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Would you mind taking a walk with me?
L558869	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm sorry.
L558868	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Well, I don't understand.
L558866	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
L558865	u8017	m543	JEREMY	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
L558864	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
L558863	u8017	m543	JEREMY	Impossible? Why?
L559208	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
L559207	u8018	m543	LACY	No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
L559206	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
L559205	u8018	m543	LACY	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
L559204	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
L559160	u8018	m543	LACY	Stuff it.
L559159	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Yes, darling?
L559158	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy . . . ?
L559157	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
L559156	u8018	m543	LACY	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
L559155	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
L558930	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
L558929	u8018	m543	LACY	Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
L558928	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
L558927	u8018	m543	LACY	Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
L558798	u8024	m543	WARFIELD	Mr. White, come with me I want to see
L558797	u8018	m543	LACY	Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
L559105	u8021	m543	LOIS	It always is with Clark.
L559104	u8018	m543	LACY	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
L559103	u8021	m543	LOIS	Where's Clark?
L559079	u8021	m543	LOIS	Our other dinner guest.
L559078	u8018	m543	LACY	What's that?
L558974	u8021	m543	LOIS	Something . . . wonderful.
L558973	u8018	m543	LACY	What's he going to say?
L558957	u8018	m543	LACY	Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
L558956	u8021	m543	LOIS	But he's never there.
L558955	u8018	m543	LACY	Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
L558954	u8021	m543	LOIS	And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
L558953	u8018	m543	LACY	Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
L558952	u8021	m543	LOIS	That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
L558951	u8018	m543	LACY	Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
L558950	u8021	m543	LOIS	Who?
L558949	u8018	m543	LACY	I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
L558856	u8018	m543	LACY	Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
L558855	u8021	m543	LOIS	An angle?
L558854	u8018	m543	LACY	I think there's an angle.
L558849	u8018	m543	LACY	Superman gets mail here?
L558848	u8021	m543	LOIS	This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
L558809	u8021	m543	LOIS	. . . And  very na?ve!
L558808	u8018	m543	LACY	But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
L558807	u8021	m543	LOIS	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
L558806	u8018	m543	LACY	I think he's kind of cute.
L558804	u8021	m543	LOIS	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
L558803	u8018	m543	LACY	Is he for real?
L559260	u8019	m543	LENNY	Lucky I brought my drums.
L559259	u8020	m543	LEX	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
L559258	u8019	m543	LENNY	You think he'll find us.
L559229	u8020	m543	LEX	If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
L559228	u8019	m543	LENNY	Ready, Uncle Lex?
L559227	u8020	m543	LEX	Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
L559218	u8019	m543	LENNY	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
L559217	u8020	m543	LEX	This wasn't in the plan.
L559216	u8019	m543	LENNY	We'll all fry.
L559132	u8020	m543	LEX	My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
L559131	u8019	m543	LENNY	Boy, are you gonna get it.
L559056	u8019	m543	LENNY	What?
L559055	u8020	m543	LEX	Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
L559054	u8019	m543	LENNY	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
L559053	u8020	m543	LEX	He's . . . cold. . .
L559052	u8020	m543	LEX	Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
L559051	u8019	m543	LENNY	Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
L559050	u8020	m543	LEX	What was that about?
L559043	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're just an experiment, freako!
L559042	u8020	m543	LEX	Hey! Just remember I made you.
L559036	u8020	m543	LEX	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
L559035	u8019	m543	LENNY	Hey! He looks . . . normal.
L559034	u8020	m543	LEX	There!
L559033	u8019	m543	LENNY	You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
L559032	u8020	m543	LEX	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
L559031	u8019	m543	LENNY	The one Superman wrecked up?
L559030	u8020	m543	LEX	Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
L559029	u8019	m543	LENNY	Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
L558990	u8020	m543	LEX	Get the box, nephew.
L558989	u8019	m543	LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
L558924	u8020	m543	LEX	I must have miscalculated. How. . .
L558923	u8019	m543	LENNY	Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
L558889	u8020	m543	LEX	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
L558888	u8019	m543	LENNY	Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
L558884	u8020	m543	LEX	He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
L558883	u8019	m543	LENNY	Whoa. . .
L558877	u8020	m543	LEX	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
L558876	u8019	m543	LENNY	He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
L558838	u8020	m543	LEX	That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
L558837	u8019	m543	LENNY	But why the hair?
L558836	u8020	m543	LEX	. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
L558835	u8019	m543	LENNY	A toupee that flies?
L558834	u8020	m543	LEX	Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
L558767	u8020	m543	LEX	Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
L558766	u8019	m543	LENNY	Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
L559200	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	I am master now.
L559199	u8020	m543	LEX	Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
L559183	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	Destiny.
L559182	u8020	m543	LEX	Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
L559181	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	What do you fear?
L559180	u8020	m543	LEX	Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
L559146	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	First, I have fun.
L559145	u8020	m543	LEX	Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
L559135	u8020	m543	LEX	Wait! Not yet! Back!
L559134	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	Destroy Superman!
L559046	u8020	m543	LEX	I made you, and I can destroy you.
L559045	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	I am an experiment? I am freako?
L559041	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
L559040	u8020	m543	LEX	What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
L559039	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	You are . . .
L559038	u8020	m543	LEX	I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
L558881	u8020	m543	LEX	For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
L558880	u8022	m543	NUCLEAR MAN	What I need this for?
L559264	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
L559263	u8020	m543	LEX	But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
L559262	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
L559261	u8020	m543	LEX	But . . . how could you beat him?
L559236	u8020	m543	LEX	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
L559235	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'll deal with you later.
L559232	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
L559231	u8020	m543	LEX	Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
L559144	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
L559143	u8020	m543	LEX	Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
L559142	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
L559141	u8020	m543	LEX	Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
L559140	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
L559139	u8020	m543	LEX	I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
L559138	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	I'm not going anywhere.
L559137	u8020	m543	LEX	No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
L559136	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
L559129	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
L559128	u8020	m543	LEX	Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
L559127	u8020	m543	LEX	Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
L559126	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
L559125	u8020	m543	LEX	Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
L559124	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
L559123	u8020	m543	LEX	Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
L559122	u8023	m543	SUPERMAN	Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
L559121	u8020	m543	LEX	Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
L582483	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Give a kiss to Edward.
L582482	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	...give a kiss to Edward.
L582481	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
L582480	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
L582479	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I know.
L582478	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I don't need them anymore...
L582477	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
L582401	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
L582400	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What's wrong?
L582399	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Damn him.
L582397	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Baked in a pie.
L582396	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Four and twenty blackbirds...
L582395	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	...a pocketful of rye.
L582189	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What happened?
L582188	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Is it cold in here?
L582158	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.  No.
L582157	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
L582149	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She said convincingly.
L582148	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I'll be fine.
L582147	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
L582137	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	He needs to be turned over.
L582136	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Like a New Year's Day hangover.
L582135	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
L582134	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
L582088	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why did we stop?
L582087	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Nothing.
L582086	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
L582085	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Sing a song of sixpence.
L581964	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	That's my girl.
L581963	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
L581962	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
L581961	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay.
L581960	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Don't bring it home in this.
L581959	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
L581958	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Yes mother.
L581957	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
L581956	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.
L581955	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
L581952	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay, okay...
L581951	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
L581950	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I'd be there for him.
L581949	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
L581948	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I do it all the time!
L581947	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
L581946	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
L581945	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
L581944	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
L581943	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Shush.
L581942	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Miriam...
L581940	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I don't want to find out.
L581939	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
L581938	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
L581936	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Someday you can.  We all believe that...
L581935	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	She thinks I can bring Edward back.
L581934	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She adores you.
L581932	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Lucien Baines?
L581931	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He hates me.
L581909	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
L581908	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.
L581907	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
L581906	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Did we go sailing?
L581903	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
L581902	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A pocketful of rye...
L581901	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Sing a song of sixpence...
L582517	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	No.  Thank you.
L582516	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No problem.
L582515	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Thank you.

L582513	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	They're hungry.
L582511	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
L582510	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It doesn't matter...
L582509	u8208	m557	NOVAK	He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
L582508	u8208	m557	NOVAK	All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
L582507	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He's mine?
L582506	u8208	m557	NOVAK	So you say.
L582505	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
L582504	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Well look at that.
L582503	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Good for them.
L582502	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Yep.  Eloped.
L582501	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I heard Julia and John got married.
L582500	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Absolutely.  Abigail...
L582499	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You sure about this?
L582498	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
L582497	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That went well.
L582372	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I can't leave him!
L582371	u8208	m557	NOVAK	COME ON!
L582365	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
L582364	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Where the hell are we?
L582359	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
L582358	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Little boy?!  That's him!
L582357	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
L582356	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"Like hell ""wait."""
L582355	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Wait...
L582256	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay, okay...
L582255	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
L582240	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Yes.  I am.
L582239	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You're sure of that?
L582238	u8208	m557	NOVAK	A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
L582235	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Tell me.
L582234	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What difference does it make...?
L582233	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What happened?
L582232	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What happened to Charles Gish?
L582231	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
L582230	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	If you believe that.
L582229	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Evil.
L582228	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Then what is he?
L582227	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like ""remorse."""
L582226	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
L582225	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
L582224	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
L582223	u8208	m557	NOVAK	This is Stargher we're talking about?
L582222	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
L582221	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You think you can do this, don't you?
L582220	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
L582219	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What about Julia?
L582218	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
L582217	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I did, yeah.
L582216	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
L582213	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
L582212	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You're the shrink, you tell me.
L582211	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Why'd you bring him here?
L582210	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
L582209	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What did you see?
L582208	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	With Stargher I saw things...
L582206	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That's what therapists are for, right?
L582205	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
L582204	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
L582203	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
L582202	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Peter, okay?
L582201	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Agent Novak?
L582200	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
L582199	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
L582198	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What then?
L582197	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	It doesn't have much to do with science.
L582196	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
L582195	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I""m here, isn't that right?"
L582194	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Do you think that's funny?
L582193	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
L582140	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I know him.
L582139	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	You don't know the procedure.
L582138	u8208	m557	NOVAK	This man is deeply disturbed, he...
L582133	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How hard could it be...?
L582132	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I realize that...
L582131	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some ""troubled kid"" you're dealing with."
L582107	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
L582106	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
L582105	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
L582104	u8208	m557	NOVAK	There's always a chance they'll confess.
L582102	u8208	m557	NOVAK	As far as I needed.
L582101	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	"What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was ""normal?""  Conscious.  How far would you go?"
L581896	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	I bet we can fix it.
L581895	u8205	m557	EDWARD	Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.
L581894	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Oh no... No you don't.
L581893	u8205	m557	EDWARD	Mocky-Lock.
L581892	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	Who says?
L581891	u8205	m557	EDWARD	's broken.
L581890	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	What now?
L581884	u8203	m557	CATHERINE	He's beautiful...
L581883	u8205	m557	EDWARD	You liked him?
L582470	u8204	m557	COLE	I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
L582469	u8208	m557	NOVAK	You're kidding me.
L582468	u8204	m557	COLE	Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
L582467	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Delano?
L582466	u8204	m557	COLE	Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
L582385	u8208	m557	NOVAK	That hoist, with the winch...
L582384	u8204	m557	COLE	Already there.
L582383	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I need you to find something in the basement...
L582382	u8204	m557	COLE	Agent Cole.
L581973	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
L581972	u8204	m557	COLE	She the one from Santa Cruz?
L582417	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	She's bringing Stargher into hers.
L582416	u8206	m557	HENRY	Instead of going into his mind...
L582412	u8206	m557	HENRY	It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
L582411	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What's wrong?
L582410	u8206	m557	HENRY	She changed the codes.
L582252	u8206	m557	HENRY	I think that's the whole point.
L582251	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
L582185	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
L582184	u8206	m557	HENRY	That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
L582163	u8206	m557	HENRY	Initiating connection.
L582162	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Intravenous administration complete.
L582161	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	"Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as ""receivers.""  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared."
L582160	u8206	m557	HENRY	Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
L582124	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
L582123	u8206	m557	HENRY	Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
L582493	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Completely unaware.
L582492	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What about the cat?
L582491	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Awaiting his arrival.
L582490	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How's the patient.
L582489	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
L582488	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	That's a secret.
L582487	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
L582486	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	You're looking well.
L582485	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Dr. Kent.
L582484	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Agent Novak.
L582380	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
L582379	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Is she alright?
L582330	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I doubt that.
L582329	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
L582328	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
L582327	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582326	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What about narcotics?
L582325	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582324	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Any psychiatric medication?
L582323	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Prevacid.  For my stomach.
L582322	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
L582321	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Absolutely.
L582320	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Nervous?
L582317	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.
L582316	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
L582313	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Yes.
L582312	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Into Stargher.  Inside...
L582311	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	"That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's ""lost.""  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy."
L582310	u8208	m557	NOVAK	When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
L582192	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I'll get her...
L582191	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	Catherine!
L582095	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
L582094	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	What about the legalities of this...?
L582091	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Sometime yesterday morning.
L582090	u8207	m557	MIRIAM	When did he lapse into the coma?
L582014	u8208	m557	NOVAK	It's his dog.
L582013	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
L582002	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
L582001	u8208	m557	NOVAK	The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
L581998	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Now.
L581997	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Now?
L581996	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I need it.
L581995	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
L581994	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	So?
L581976	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
L581975	u8210	m557	TEDDY LEE	Someone looking after her little girl?
L582394	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
L582393	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
L582392	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
L582390	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Considering where I've been...
L582389	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
L582244	u8208	m557	NOVAK	But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
L582243	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Next time, tell me, okay?
L582242	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Right here.
L582120	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
L582119	u8208	m557	NOVAK	"Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say ""It was all his idea."""
L582118	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
L582117	u8208	m557	NOVAK	I don't have to.
L582116	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
L582115	u8208	m557	NOVAK	What else do we do?!
L582114	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	You sure you want to go through with this?
L582078	u8208	m557	NOVAK	They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
L582077	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
L582043	u8208	m557	NOVAK	No.  Can you get a man close?
L582042	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
L582041	u8208	m557	NOVAK	We proceed assuming she is.
L582031	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	"She remembers because it was her ""dream truck.""  Wanted one just like it."
L582030	u8208	m557	NOVAK	After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
L582012	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
L582011	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
L581988	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
L581987	u8208	m557	NOVAK	Here he is.
L581986	u8209	m557	RAMSEY	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
L581985	u8208	m557	NOVAK	How is she?
L621983	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Let's let Molly open one.
L621982	u8534	m579	ANDY	Which one can I open first?
L621980	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
L621979	u8534	m579	ANDY	Here!  In the car!
L621978	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
L621977	u8534	m579	ANDY	Woody!  Buzz!
L621976	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	What?  What is it?
L621975	u8534	m579	ANDY	Hey!  Wow!
L621905	u8534	m579	ANDY	Bye, house.
L621904	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	"Everybody say, ""Bye, house."""
L621812	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
L621811	u8534	m579	ANDY	But what if we leave them behind?
L621810	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
L621641	u8534	m579	ANDY	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
L621640	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
L621639	u8534	m579	ANDY	Right here in the van.
L621638	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Where was the last place you left him?
L621637	u8534	m579	ANDY	Mom, have you seen Woody?
L621491	u8534	m579	ANDY	Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
L621490	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Next stop...
L621479	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
L621478	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
L621477	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yeah?!
L621476	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
L621475	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can I help pump the gas?
L621471	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
L621470	u8534	m579	ANDY	I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
L621469	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay...
L621468	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
L621467	u8534	m579	ANDY	But Mom, I can't find him!
L621466	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
L621464	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	No, I haven't seen him.
L621463	u8534	m579	ANDY	Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
L621422	u8534	m579	ANDY	Just one?
L621421	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	You can bring ONE toy...
L621420	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can I bring some toys?
L621418	u8534	m579	ANDY	Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
L621417	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
L621416	u8534	m579	ANDY	To infinity and beyond!
L621271	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, yeah!
L621270	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
L621137	u8534	m579	ANDY	Okay.
L621136	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
L621135	u8534	m579	ANDY	Yeah!
L621134	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Well, sure, we can leave it up.
L621133	u8534	m579	ANDY	Can we leave this up 'til we move?
L621132	u8534	m579	ANDY	Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
L621131	u8540	m579	MRS. DAVIS	Whadda ya think?
L621130	u8534	m579	ANDY	Wow!  Cool!
L621990	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Mm-hmmmmm.
L621989	u8545	m579	WOODY	Say, isn't that mistletoe?
L621988	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
L621987	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
L621943	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Rocky!  The ramp!
L621942	u8545	m579	WOODY	We're almost there.
L621752	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
L621751	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	What are you doing over there?
L621363	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
L621362	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
L621315	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
L621314	u8545	m579	WOODY	You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
L621175	u8545	m579	WOODY	Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
L621174	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
L621173	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, hey - it was nothing.
L621172	u8535	m579	BO PEEP	I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
L621171	u8545	m579	WOODY	Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
L622000	u8545	m579	WOODY	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
L621999	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
L621974	u8536	m579	BUZZ	We're not aiming for the truck!
L621973	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
L621972	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
L621971	u8536	m579	BUZZ	This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
L621970	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
L621968	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Not today!
L621967	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
L621962	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
L621961	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha-ha!!
L621960	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hold still, Buzz!
L621959	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody?!  What are you doing?
L621956	u8545	m579	WOODY	The match!
L621955	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  The rocket!
L621954	u8545	m579	WOODY	Great!
L621935	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look out!!
L621934	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, thanks for the ride.
L621916	u8536	m579	BUZZ	NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
L621915	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
L621914	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hold on, Woody!
L621902	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!
L621901	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
L621878	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's ok.  Everything's under control.
L621877	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What?!
L621876	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shhhhhhh!
L621842	u8545	m579	WOODY	We've got to get out of here...NOW.
L621841	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody!  It's the moving van.
L621839	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes Sir!
L621838	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
L621837	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
L621832	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
L621831	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But why would Andy want me?
L621830	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
L621829	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yeah, right.
L621828	u8545	m579	WOODY	Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
L621827	u8536	m579	BUZZ	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
L621826	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
L621825	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
L621824	u8545	m579	WOODY	Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
L621823	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
L621822	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
L621729	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Years of Academy training...wasted!!
L621728	u8545	m579	WOODY	Come on, this way!
L621727	u8545	m579	WOODY	Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
L621726	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
L621725	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
L621724	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
L621723	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Oh, I'm a sham!!
L621719	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
L621718	u8545	m579	WOODY	I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
L621717	u8536	m579	BUZZ	One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
L621716	u8545	m579	WOODY	What happened to you?
L621672	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shhh!
L621671	u8545	m579	WOODY	Don't tell me what to do!
L621670	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
L621667	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
L621666	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, stop it!!
L621665	u8545	m579	WOODY	Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
L621664	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
L621663	u8545	m579	WOODY	Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
L621662	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
L621661	u8536	m579	BUZZ	It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
L621660	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Shield your eyes!
L621659	u8545	m579	WOODY	They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
L621658	u8545	m579	WOODY	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
L621657	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Woody, we don't know what's out there!
L621655	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
L621654	u8545	m579	WOODY	I sure hope this isn't permanent.
L621633	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
L621632	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I've set my laser from stun to kill.
L621574	u8545	m579	WOODY	YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
L621573	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
L621555	u8545	m579	WOODY	Alright Buzz, get ready...
L621554	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Spaceship.
L621553	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where is it?  I don't see the --
L621552	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
L621551	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
L621550	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean it has hyperdrive?
L621549	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
L621542	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sorry.
L621541	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ow!  Watch where you're going!
L621524	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
L621523	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
L621522	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Well, then let's climb abroad.
L621521	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
L621520	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
L621516	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Go away.
L621515	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
L621503	u8545	m579	WOODY	WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
L621502	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
L621501	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
L621500	u8536	m579	BUZZ	My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
L621499	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
L621498	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
L621497	u8545	m579	WOODY	Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
L621496	u8536	m579	BUZZ	According to my nava-computer, the --
L621487	u8545	m579	WOODY	No.
L621486	u8536	m579	BUZZ	But we're not on my planet, are we?
L621485	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh.  Oh, that's good.
L621484	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
L621483	u8545	m579	WOODY	Right?  Buddy?
L621429	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Then we've no time to lose!!
L621428	u8545	m579	WOODY	Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
L621427	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Trouble?!  Where?!
L621426	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
L621414	u8545	m579	WOODY	Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
L621413	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I could have stopped him.
L621401	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You mean that happy child?
L621400	u8545	m579	WOODY	THAT is Sid!
L621399	u8545	m579	WOODY	No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
L621398	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Sure is a hairy fellah.
L621397	u8545	m579	WOODY	That's why.  Sid.
L621396	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
L621395	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I'd better take a look anyway.
L621394	u8545	m579	WOODY	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
L621393	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What's going on?
L621379	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Where?
L621378	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
L621377	u8536	m579	BUZZ	You're mocking me, aren't you?
L621376	u8545	m579	WOODY	"You actually think you're THE ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!"
L621373	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
L621372	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Don't even think about it, cowboy!
L621371	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
L621370	u8545	m579	WOODY	And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
L621369	u8536	m579	BUZZ	What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
L621368	u8545	m579	WOODY	Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
L621346	u8545	m579	WOODY	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
L621345	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
L621340	u8536	m579	BUZZ	All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
L621339	u8545	m579	WOODY	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
L621338	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
L621337	u8545	m579	WOODY	Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
L621336	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Can!
L621335	u8545	m579	WOODY	You can't!
L621334	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Yes, I can.
L621333	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, you can't.
L621332	u8536	m579	BUZZ	They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
L621329	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me.
L621328	u8545	m579	WOODY	He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
L621325	u8545	m579	WOODY	The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
L621324	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
L621323	u8545	m579	WOODY	T-O-Y.  Toy.
L621322	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Toy?
L621301	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
L621300	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
L621296	u8536	m579	BUZZ	Watch yourself!!
L621295	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
L621294	u8536	m579	BUZZ	I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
L621293	u8545	m579	WOODY	Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
L621290	u8536	m579	BUZZ	HO-YAAAHH!!!
L621289	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hello-o-o...
L621773	u8545	m579	WOODY	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
L621772	u8537	m579	HAMM	Something's screwy here.
L621742	u8537	m579	HAMM	Everyone, it's Woody!
L621741	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hi!
L621331	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
L621330	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
L621319	u8537	m579	HAMM	What's with him?
L621318	u8545	m579	WOODY	It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
L621259	u8545	m579	WOODY	Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
L621258	u8537	m579	HAMM	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
L621257	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
L621199	u8545	m579	WOODY	Stay calm, everyone!!
L621198	u8537	m579	HAMM	Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
L621197	u8545	m579	WOODY	It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
L621779	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Murderer!
L621778	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, that is disgusting.
L621740	u8537	m579	HAMM	He's in the psycho's bedroom!
L621739	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Son of a building block, it's Woody!
L621737	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	How 'bout three out of five?
L621736	u8537	m579	HAMM	No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
L621735	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
L621734	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Are you peeking?
L621733	u8537	m579	HAMM	Heh-heh.
L621732	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Ohhh!  You sunk it!
L621731	u8537	m579	HAMM	Miss.  G-6.
L621730	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	B-3.
L621456	u8537	m579	HAMM	I got dibs on his hat!
L621455	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Let's string him up by his pull- string!
L621243	u8537	m579	HAMM	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
L621242	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Hey, watch it!
L621202	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	I can't see a thing!
L621201	u8537	m579	HAMM	Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!

L621608	u8538	m579	HANNAH	No she's NOT --
L621607	u8543	m579	SID	She's sick!
L621606	u8538	m579	HANNAH	Hey!!
L621605	u8543	m579	SID	Look!  Janie!
L621604	u8538	m579	HANNAH	What?
L621603	u8543	m579	SID	Oh no, Hannah!
L621602	u8538	m579	HANNAH	I don't know!
L621601	u8543	m579	SID	Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
L621600	u8538	m579	HANNAH	I dunno.
L621599	u8543	m579	SID	Did I get my package in the mail?
L621598	u8538	m579	HANNAH	What?
L621817	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
L621816	u8541	m579	REX	I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
L621815	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Will you quit moving around?!
L621814	u8541	m579	REX	Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
L621645	u8541	m579	REX	Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
L621644	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.

L621313	u8541	m579	REX	And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...

L621446	u8545	m579	WOODY	Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
L621388	u8545	m579	WOODY	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
L621387	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Who is it this time?

L621320	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Laser-envy.
L621233	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	A lunchbox...?!
L621232	u8545	m579	WOODY	A lunchbox?!
L621192	u8539	m579	MR. POTATO HEAD	Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
L621191	u8545	m579	WOODY	Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

L621195	u8541	m579	REX	But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
L621194	u8545	m579	WOODY	C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
L621169	u8545	m579	WOODY	I was close to being scared that time.
L621168	u8541	m579	REX	Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

L621450	u8541	m579	REX	Oh, I don't like confrontations.
L621449	u8544	m579	SLINKY	We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
L621383	u8541	m579	REX	I thought he was at summer camp!
L621382	u8544	m579	SLINKY	It's Sid!
L621275	u8541	m579	REX	Woody?  Who's up there with you?

L621228	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!

L621148	u8542	m579	SARGENT	Sir!  No Sir!
L621147	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
L621893	u8545	m579	WOODY	That's right.  Your toys.
L621892	u8543	m579	SID	W-w-w-we?
L621889	u8543	m579	SID	It's busted.
L621888	u8545	m579	WOODY	Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
L621887	u8543	m579	SID	What?!
L621886	u8545	m579	WOODY	This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
L621885	u8543	m579	SID	Huh?
L621884	u8545	m579	WOODY	Reach for the sky!!
L621799	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sid!!!
L621798	u8543	m579	SID	Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
L621569	u8545	m579	WOODY	This is ludicrous.
L621392	u8543	m579	SID	Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
L621391	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
L621381	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-oh.
L621380	u8543	m579	SID	Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
L621953	u8545	m579	WOODY	Slink!  Hang on!
L621952	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I can't hold on much longer!
L621949	u8545	m579	WOODY	Speed up!
L621948	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody!  Speed up!
L621775	u8544	m579	SLINKY	See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
L621774	u8545	m579	WOODY	Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
L621750	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I knew you'd come back, Woody!
L621749	u8545	m579	WOODY	Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
L621746	u8545	m579	WOODY	We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
L621745	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody?!
L621349	u8545	m579	WOODY	Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
L621348	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
L621277	u8545	m579	WOODY	Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
L621276	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
L621159	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Got it.
L621158	u8545	m579	WOODY	Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
L621157	u8545	m579	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!
L621156	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Bad news?!
L621155	u8545	m579	WOODY	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
L621154	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
L621153	u8545	m579	WOODY	No, Slink --
L621152	u8544	m579	SLINKY	I'm red this time.
L621151	u8544	m579	SLINKY	Right here, Woody!
L621150	u8545	m579	WOODY	Hey, Slinky?
L622271	u8546	m580	FINN	Nothing is left but us.
L622270	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Everything is gone, now.
L622269	u8546	m580	FINN	So had I.
L622268	u8548	m580	MELANIE	But then I had a brother and a sister left.
L622267	u8546	m580	FINN	So did I.
L622266	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I already lost everything once.
L622254	u8546	m580	FINN	All the time.
L622253	u8548	m580	MELANIE	How long has -
L622252	u8546	m580	FINN	What difference does <i>that</i> make?
L622251	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Surely she is older?
L622250	u8546	m580	FINN	Did you now.
L622249	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
L622246	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Do you think we should take her up to bed?
L622245	u8546	m580	FINN	It was only a mouthful!
L622244	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
L622243	u8546	m580	FINN	H'm?
L622242	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
L622234	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
L622233	u8546	m580	FINN	Reprieve.
L622228	u8546	m580	FINN	In my pocket.
L622227	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Finn ...
L622226	u8546	m580	FINN	I've got a present for you...
L622225	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Stop it!
L622224	u8546	m580	FINN	Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
L622223	u8548	m580	MELANIE	The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
L622222	u8546	m580	FINN	Can you move over a wee bit?
L622221	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
L622220	u8546	m580	FINN	He'll be looking for another apprentice.
L622219	u8548	m580	MELANIE	He'll murder you when he finds out.
L622217	u8548	m580	MELANIE	You did what?
L622216	u8546	m580	FINN	I finished it off.
L622215	u8548	m580	MELANIE	You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
L622214	u8546	m580	FINN	I'm cold.
L622213	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Finn -
L622212	u8546	m580	FINN	Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
L622211	u8546	m580	FINN	Ah, come on now!
L622210	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Well ... yes. All right. But -
L622209	u8546	m580	FINN	Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
L622207	u8546	m580	FINN	Let me in.
L622206	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Who's there?
L622191	u8546	m580	FINN	Living with him put years on me.
L622190	u8548	m580	MELANIE	You're not so old yourself!
L622189	u8546	m580	FINN	You're only a young thing.
L622188	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Do what?  Oh, I see.
L622187	u8546	m580	FINN	I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
L622186	u8548	m580	MELANIE	What did I do wrong?
L622185	u8546	m580	FINN	Go away.
L622184	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
L622178	u8546	m580	FINN	Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
L622177	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Is that all?
L622176	u8546	m580	FINN	That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
L622133	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Get away from me...
L622132	u8546	m580	FINN	What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
L622111	u8548	m580	MELANIE	What about school?
L622110	u8546	m580	FINN	She'll have to learn.
L622109	u8548	m580	MELANIE	She's not accustomed to being ignored.
L622098	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I can't go home because there's no home left.
L622097	u8546	m580	FINN	Home is where the heart is.
L622096	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I want to go home.
L622095	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
L622094	u8546	m580	FINN	Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
L622086	u8546	m580	FINN	Didn't you know he made things?
L622085	u8548	m580	MELANIE	It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
L622084	u8546	m580	FINN	He made that. In his off hours.
L622083	u8546	m580	FINN	She got away.
L622082	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
L622081	u8546	m580	FINN	He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
L622080	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
L622077	u8546	m580	FINN	Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
L622076	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Is there anything else I should know about him?
L622075	u8546	m580	FINN	Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
L622074	u8548	m580	MELANIE	A sin against <i>what?</i>
L622073	u8546	m580	FINN	He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
L622071	u8546	m580	FINN	I carried you up to your bed.
L622070	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I did like the music.
L622069	u8546	m580	FINN	Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
L622064	u8546	m580	FINN	You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
L622063	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I like plaits.
L622062	u8546	m580	FINN	Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
L622061	u8548	m580	MELANIE	He's a pyjama case, really.
L622060	u8546	m580	FINN	Excuse me.
L622059	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I can manage.
L622057	u8546	m580	FINN	There's not.
L622056	u8548	m580	MELANIE	There's no mirror.
L622055	u8546	m580	FINN	You'll put your clothes here.
L622042	u8546	m580	FINN	There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
L622041	u8548	m580	MELANIE	But you're Irish!
L622040	u8546	m580	FINN	You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
L622023	u8548	m580	MELANIE	In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
L622022	u8547	m580	JONATHON	Juliet who?
L622021	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
L622020	u8547	m580	JONATHON	We're too young.
L622019	u8548	m580	MELANIE	They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
L622015	u8547	m580	JONATHON	Storms?
L622014	u8548	m580	MELANIE	'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
L622169	u8548	m580	MELANIE	It's all right, Finn.
L622168	u8549	m580	PHILIP	Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
L622163	u8549	m580	PHILIP	I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
L622162	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
L622161	u8549	m580	PHILIP	You're well built; how old are you?
L622125	u8549	m580	PHILIP	What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
L622124	u8548	m580	MELANIE	Victoria -
L622123	u8549	m580	PHILIP	Did you do this?
L622102	u8549	m580	PHILIP	You're late for breakfast.
L622101	u8548	m580	MELANIE	I'm Melanie.
L634416	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes.
L634415	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	Is that the entire message?
L634414	u8697	m590	DAVID	Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
L634413	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	Proceed.
L634411	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	I had to put him down.
L634410	u8697	m590	DAVID	Wow.
L634409	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
L634408	u8697	m590	DAVID	Oh.
L634407	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
L634406	u8697	m590	DAVID	Is Noel in?
L634405	u8695	m590	ANCIENT SECRETARY	Yes?
L634487	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	I have a lock on the door.
L634486	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	What about Jeb?
L634485	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	I'll keep it in my office room.
L634484	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I'm listening.
L634480	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
L634479	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	What did I say?
L634478	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
L634477	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	No.
L634476	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	Four.
L634475	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How old is Jeb?
L634474	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
L634473	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Once again please?
L634471	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You've made a considerably wise decision.
L634470	u8696	m590	BUSINESS MAN	Wrap it up.
L634858	u8702	m590	MEGAN	It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
L634857	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't know Megan.
L634856	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Why?
L634853	u8702	m590	MEGAN	That counts.
L634852	u8697	m590	DAVID	I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
L634851	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
L634850	u8702	m590	MEGAN	It's finished. I won.
L634849	u8697	m590	DAVID	What about the game?
L634848	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Think carefully?
L634847	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm not sure.
L634844	u8702	m590	MEGAN	My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
L634843	u8697	m590	DAVID	Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
L634842	u8702	m590	MEGAN	We're supposed to be honest.
L634841	u8697	m590	DAVID	What was that?
L634840	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
L634839	u8697	m590	DAVID	My turn. What's your favorite song?
L634838	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
L634837	u8697	m590	DAVID	As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
L634836	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Rust?
L634835	u8697	m590	DAVID	...I think rust.
L634780	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
L634779	u8702	m590	MEGAN	He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
L634778	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jesus.
L634777	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
L634775	u8697	m590	DAVID	out again?
L634774	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Yes.
L634773	u8697	m590	DAVID	Would you like to try going--
L634771	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
L634770	u8702	m590	MEGAN	He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
L634669	u8702	m590	MEGAN	You use your sleeve.
L634668	u8697	m590	DAVID	What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
L634664	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
L634663	u8697	m590	DAVID	...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
L634660	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
L634659	u8697	m590	DAVID	I remember you.
L634658	u8702	m590	MEGAN	My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
L634657	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
L634656	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Yes. Is this David?
L634655	u8697	m590	DAVID	Megan?
L634538	u8697	m590	DAVID	Oh.
L634537	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I've come to a decision.
L634449	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
L634448	u8697	m590	DAVID	Oh shit...
L634447	u8702	m590	MEGAN	The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
L634446	u8697	m590	DAVID	When was the last time I wore pink?
L634443	u8697	m590	DAVID	No that's it.
L634442	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
L634441	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes.
L634440	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is that what you wanted to ask me?
L634439	u8702	m590	MEGAN	It means we're probably to tired to remember.
L634438	u8697	m590	DAVID	That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
L634437	u8702	m590	MEGAN	...I can't remember.
L634435	u8697	m590	DAVID	Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
L634434	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Not a specific day. What's this about?
L634433	u8697	m590	DAVID	Do you remember me getting sick?
L634432	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Okay.
L634431	u8697	m590	DAVID	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
L634430	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I don't know. It's been a while.
L634427	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Oh.
L634426	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's asleep.
L634425	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is Jeremy okay?
L634372	u8697	m590	DAVID	I know.
L634371	u8702	m590	MEGAN	I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
L634370	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
L634369	u8702	m590	MEGAN	What does that mean?
L634368	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't think I got the job in New York.
L634819	u8697	m590	DAVID	No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
L634818	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Are you finished?
L634817	u8697	m590	DAVID	You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
L634816	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
L634815	u8697	m590	DAVID	Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
L634814	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	That's not what I witnessed David.
L634813	u8697	m590	DAVID	I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
L634593	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
L634592	u8697	m590	DAVID	Quick.
L634591	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	One last question.
L634590	u8697	m590	DAVID	I have to go now.
L634589	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
L634588	u8697	m590	DAVID	The guy might not have been carrying anything.
L634587	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
L634586	u8697	m590	DAVID	Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
L634585	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
L634584	u8697	m590	DAVID	Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
L634583	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You're skill.
L634582	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't know what you're asking?
L634581	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Have you ever tried to develop it?
L634580	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes.
L634579	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Telling when people have done something wrong?
L634578	u8697	m590	DAVID	Like what?
L634577	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
L634576	u8697	m590	DAVID	I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
L634575	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	But not a knife?
L634574	u8697	m590	DAVID	I thought he was carrying something.
L634573	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You thought he was carrying a knife?
L634572	u8697	m590	DAVID	Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
L634571	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
L634570	u8697	m590	DAVID	I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
L634568	u8697	m590	DAVID	That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
L634567	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Is there a problem?
L634566	u8697	m590	DAVID	Just give me a minute.
L634559	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
L634558	u8697	m590	DAVID	Are you for real?
L634557	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
L634555	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	We've already begun.
L634554	u8697	m590	DAVID	We're not proceeding anywhere together.
L634553	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
L634552	u8697	m590	DAVID	What do you want?
L634551	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
L634550	u8697	m590	DAVID	It's for last week's game.
L634529	u8697	m590	DAVID	I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
L634528	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You've misunderstood.
L634527	u8697	m590	DAVID	What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
L634526	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
L634525	u8697	m590	DAVID	At the church... You were following me weren't you?
L634519	u8697	m590	DAVID	What was your idea Elijah?
L634518	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
L634516	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
L634515	u8697	m590	DAVID	"You forgot the ""Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on"" step. See usually that comes before the, ""It's over"" Step. And it always, always comes before the ""You can go"" Step.  What is over?"
L634512	u8697	m590	DAVID	You assumed wrong.
L634511	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I assumed because of the train.
L634509	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Was it serious?
L634508	u8697	m590	DAVID	In college. A car accident.
L634507	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	What's he talking about?
L634505	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
L634504	u8697	m590	DAVID	Skeptical about what?
L634503	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
L634502	u8697	m590	DAVID	Seventy-five percent.
L634501	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
L634496	u8697	m590	DAVID	I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
L634495	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You've never been sick?
L634931	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	Yes he is.
L634930	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's kind of a miracle.
L634929	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
L634928	u8697	m590	DAVID	He's doing well today.
L634927	u8697	m590	DAVID	We are.
L634926	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
L634925	u8697	m590	DAVID	It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
L634924	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
L634744	u8703	m590	WALKIE	Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
L634743	u8697	m590	DAVID	When?
L634742	u8703	m590	WALKIE	There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
L634741	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yeah?
L634547	u8703	m590	WALKIE	Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
L634546	u8697	m590	DAVID	Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
L634545	u8703	m590	WALKIE	He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
L634544	u8697	m590	DAVID	What's he look like?
L634543	u8703	m590	WALKIE	Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
L634798	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
L634797	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Don't be scared.
L634796	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy listen to what--
L634795	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'll just shoot him once.
L634792	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
L634791	u8700	m590	JEREMY	You're lying.
L634790	u8697	m590	DAVID	That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
L634785	u8697	m590	DAVID	Elijah was wrong.
L634784	u8700	m590	JEREMY	YOU WON'T GET HURT...
L634695	u8700	m590	JEREMY	You're secret identity.  That man was right.
L634694	u8697	m590	DAVID	Know what?
L634693	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I know now.
L634692	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Do you know why?
L634691	u8697	m590	DAVID	That's great.
L634690	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'm not scared.
L634689	u8697	m590	DAVID	I see.
L634688	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'm sleeping in my room.
L634648	u8697	m590	DAVID	There's no more left?
L634647	u8700	m590	JEREMY	All of it.
L634646	u8697	m590	DAVID	How many did you put on that time?
L634645	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Get mom.
L634644	u8697	m590	DAVID	What do you do if something happens?
L634638	u8697	m590	DAVID	Two hundred and seventy.
L634637	u8700	m590	JEREMY	How much is it?
L634635	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I lied.
L634634	u8697	m590	DAVID	How much did you take off?
L634632	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
L634631	u8697	m590	DAVID	No Jeremy.
L634630	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I mean if you knew karate?
L634629	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634625	u8700	m590	JEREMY	How much can you lift?
L634624	u8697	m590	DAVID	You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
L634621	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
L634620	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634619	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
L634618	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634617	u8700	m590	JEREMY	You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
L634614	u8697	m590	DAVID	There's nothing to do.
L634613	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I'll help you.
L634612	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm going to work out.
L634611	u8700	m590	JEREMY	What things?
L634610	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
L634609	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Just one--
L634608	u8697	m590	DAVID	Why'd you do that?
L634607	u8700	m590	JEREMY	Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
L634606	u8697	m590	DAVID	I'm going to go in.
L634605	u8697	m590	DAVID	In under six seconds.  I've heard.
L634604	u8700	m590	JEREMY	He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
L634379	u8697	m590	DAVID	How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
L634378	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I won't make any noise.
L634377	u8697	m590	DAVID	I think it's be better if I was alone.
L634376	u8700	m590	JEREMY	I want to sleep here tonight.
L634375	u8697	m590	DAVID	Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
L634922	u8704	m590	WOMAN	That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
L634921	u8697	m590	DAVID	He doesn't look very threatening.
L634654	u8704	m590	WOMAN	Is David Dunne there?
L634653	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yeah, hello.
L634327	u8704	m590	WOMAN	This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
L634326	u8697	m590	DAVID	Not really.
L634325	u8704	m590	WOMAN	I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
L634324	u8697	m590	DAVID	You represent someone in Philadelphia?
L634323	u8697	m590	DAVID	But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
L634322	u8704	m590	WOMAN	Is that right?
L634321	u8697	m590	DAVID	What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
L634320	u8704	m590	WOMAN	It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
L634319	u8697	m590	DAVID	You like sports?
L634354	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634353	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	Did you get up from your seat?
L634352	u8697	m590	DAVID	No.
L634351	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	Was your family traveling with you?
L634350	u8697	m590	DAVID	Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
L634349	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	In the passenger car?
L634348	u8697	m590	DAVID	Against a window.
L634347	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	Where were you sitting on the train?
L634346	u8697	m590	DAVID	Fine.
L634345	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
L634344	u8697	m590	DAVID	Okay.
L634343	u8701	m590	MAN IN SCRUBS	How are you feeling?
L634735	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
L634734	u8702	m590	MEGAN	For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
L634733	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
L634732	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Is this a religious thing?
L634730	u8702	m590	MEGAN	And what was that explanation?
L634729	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
L634721	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	...And everyone lived happily ever after.
L634720	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
L634719	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	You and my mother would have a special connection.
L634718	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
L634717	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How so?
L634716	u8702	m590	MEGAN	...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
L634715	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Now you're going to have to tell me more.
L634713	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How did you get together?
L634712	u8702	m590	MEGAN	Twelve years.
L634711	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	How long have you been married?
L634710	u8702	m590	MEGAN	We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
L634462	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	On a bench, across the street.
L634461	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Where is it?
L634460	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	Well, go get it then.
L634459	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	Forget why. Do you want it or not?
L634458	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	Why?
L634457	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	...I got a present for you.
L634454	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
L634453	u8698	m590	ELIJAH	I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
L634452	u8699	m590	ELIJAH'S MOTHER	No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
L646115	u8846	m600	CHINA	A body.  I mean we're talking major body
L646114	u8855	m600	SARAH	What's that?
L646113	u8846	m600	CHINA	But he still has something Mark hasn't.
L646112	u8855	m600	SARAH	But?

L646107	u8846	m600	CHINA	Businessman!
L646106	u8855	m600	SARAH	Businessman?
L646105	u8846	m600	CHINA	Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
L646104	u8855	m600	SARAH	He did?
L646103	u8846	m600	CHINA	Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
L646102	u8855	m600	SARAH	He still likes you
L646101	u8846	m600	CHINA	With Mark?
L646100	u8855	m600	SARAH	I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
L646421	u8851	m600	MARK	China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
L646420	u8846	m600	CHINA	Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
L646180	u8851	m600	MARK	Ok toots, I will.
L646179	u8846	m600	CHINA	Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
L646173	u8851	m600	MARK	Suffer?  We're living in America.
L646172	u8846	m600	CHINA	Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
L646171	u8851	m600	MARK	I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
L646170	u8851	m600	MARK	A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
L646169	u8851	m600	MARK	Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
L646168	u8846	m600	CHINA	Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
L646167	u8851	m600	MARK	About what?  About us.
L646166	u8851	m600	MARK	We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
L646162	u8846	m600	CHINA	It's eleven forty-five let's go
L646161	u8851	m600	MARK	Anybody want another drink?
L646144	u8851	m600	MARK	Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
L646143	u8846	m600	CHINA	Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
L646322	u8853	m600	MR LINCOLN	Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
L646321	u8847	m600	INSPECTOR ROBERTS	Yes, I guess you're right
L646320	u8847	m600	INSPECTOR ROBERTS	It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
L646319	u8853	m600	MR LINCOLN	Would you like a closer look?
L646318	u8847	m600	INSPECTOR ROBERTS	Hmm.
L646317	u8853	m600	MR LINCOLN	Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
L646309	u8853	m600	MR LINCOLN	Hi
L646308	u8847	m600	INSPECTOR ROBERTS	Weird and tiny huh?

L646424	u8851	m600	MARK	Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
L646416	u8848	m600	JENKINS	Good evening sir.
L646415	u8851	m600	MARK	Jenkins!

L646270	u8854	m600	MRS WEBSTER	Can I give her a message?
L646269	u8849	m600	JONATHAN	A party at a waxwork huh?
L646268	u8854	m600	MRS WEBSTER	She went to a waxwork party
L646267	u8849	m600	JONATHAN	No?
L646266	u8854	m600	MRS WEBSTER	No Jonathan.
L646265	u8849	m600	JONATHAN	Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
L646264	u8854	m600	MRS WEBSTER	Hello?
L646260	u8850	m600	JUNIOR	Vell.  Goodnight.
L646259	u8851	m600	MARK	Tony and China?
L646258	u8850	m600	JUNIOR	They seemed, closing by much 
L646257	u8850	m600	JUNIOR	Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
L646256	u8851	m600	MARK	Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
L646255	u8850	m600	JUNIOR	I hope you enjoyed your visit.
L646193	u8851	m600	MARK	Uh, wrong picture Tony.
L646192	u8850	m600	JUNIOR	Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
L646401	u8855	m600	SARAH	Go away.
L646400	u8851	m600	MARK	Sarah listen to me.
L646365	u8851	m600	MARK	China
L646364	u8855	m600	SARAH	Well, it all started when a friend and I
L646343	u8851	m600	MARK	Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
L646342	u8855	m600	SARAH	Well?
L646340	u8855	m600	SARAH	Who's is all this?
L646339	u8851	m600	MARK	If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
L646334	u8855	m600	SARAH	Big deal!
L646333	u8851	m600	MARK	You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
L646332	u8855	m600	SARAH	Oh that explains everything.
L646331	u8851	m600	MARK	Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
L646330	u8855	m600	SARAH	You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
L646300	u8855	m600	SARAH	A little?
L646299	u8851	m600	MARK	Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
L646298	u8855	m600	SARAH	That's not what you said last night.
L646297	u8851	m600	MARK	No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
L646286	u8855	m600	SARAH	No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
L646285	u8851	m600	MARK	Come on.
L646284	u8855	m600	SARAH	I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
L646283	u8855	m600	SARAH	No Mark. MARK Why not?
L646263	u8855	m600	SARAH	I know what you mean.
L646262	u8851	m600	MARK	Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
L646261	u8855	m600	SARAH	Then why do you still like her?
L646254	u8851	m600	MARK	I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
L646253	u8855	m600	SARAH	Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
L646252	u8851	m600	MARK	What?  Tony and China, together?
L646251	u8855	m600	SARAH	Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
L646247	u8855	m600	SARAH	I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
L646246	u8851	m600	MARK	Haven't we been doing our homework.
L646204	u8857	m600	TONY	This. is killer.
L646203	u8851	m600	MARK	Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
L646202	u8857	m600	TONY	This time I really don't see anyone man.
L646190	u8857	m600	TONY	Right behind you.
L646189	u8851	m600	MARK	Anyone else not coming?
L646183	u8851	m600	MARK	Right.
L646182	u8857	m600	TONY	Safety in numbers man.
L646181	u8851	m600	MARK	Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
L646138	u8857	m600	TONY	Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
L646137	u8851	m600	MARK	I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
L646376	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	Maybe before the event, never after.
L646375	u8851	m600	MARK	Can this be stopped?
L646374	u8851	m600	MARK	Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
L646373	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
L646372	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
L646371	u8851	m600	MARK	Sell my soul?
L646370	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
L646368	u8851	m600	MARK	Six six and six
L646367	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	Well divide 18 into three
L646366	u8851	m600	MARK	Well?
L646362	u8851	m600	MARK	Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
L646361	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	So Mark, what's so urgent?
L646360	u8851	m600	MARK	No thank you sir we're fine.
L646358	u8856	m600	SIR WILFRED	Hi there Sarah
L646357	u8851	m600	MARK	Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.

L646086	u8851	m600	MARK	Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
L646085	u8852	m600	MARKS MOTHER	Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
L646084	u8851	m600	MARK	Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
L646083	u8852	m600	MARKS MOTHER	Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
L646082	u8851	m600	MARK	They're all human beings
L646081	u8852	m600	MARKS MOTHER	One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
L646080	u8851	m600	MARK	Mom.
L646079	u8852	m600	MARKS MOTHER	Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
L646177	u8857	m600	TONY	Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
L646176	u8855	m600	SARAH	Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?

L649088	u8868	m602	MORGAN	":What do you mean ""They"" are? Are you officially a woman now?"
L649087	u8869	m602	NICK	:Well, they are.
L649086	u8868	m602	MORGAN	:Would you stop it!
L649085	u8869	m602	NICK	:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
L649084	u8868	m602	MORGAN	:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
L657837	u8928	m608	AIRK	Let's go.
L657836	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Thank you, friend.
L657835	u8928	m608	AIRK	Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
L657834	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
L657782	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Just get me some horses.
L657781	u8928	m608	AIRK	You're chasing a dream.
L657779	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Then come with us.
L657778	u8928	m608	AIRK	You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
L657769	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	They're not after me.  They want the baby.
L657768	u8928	m608	AIRK	It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
L657763	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Is this what's left of your army?
L657762	u8928	m608	AIRK	You managed alright.
L657761	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	You left me to die, friend.
L657369	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
L657368	u8928	m608	AIRK	Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
L657367	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
L657365	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
L657364	u8928	m608	AIRK	I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
L657363	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
L657362	u8928	m608	AIRK	Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
L657361	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	He thought you were a woman, Airk!
L657360	u8928	m608	AIRK	We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
L657457	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
L657456	u8937	m608	WILLOW	They look like acorns.
L657454	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
L657453	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
L657452	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
L657451	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	You are very important, Willow.
L657450	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
L657449	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
L657446	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What is Tir Asleen?
L657445	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
L657444	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Me?
L657443	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
L657441	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
L657440	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
L657434	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
L657433	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Yes...?
L657432	u8929	m608	CHERLINDREA	Willow Ufgood.
L657291	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
L657290	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
L657289	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Go in the direction the bird is flying.
L657288	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
L657287	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
L657286	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
L657285	u8937	m608	WILLOW	If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
L657284	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
L657256	u8937	m608	WILLOW	My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
L657255	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
L657238	u8937	m608	WILLOW	It's a matter of great importance to me!
L657237	u8930	m608	HIGH ALDWIN	Not today, Willow.
L657236	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Sir!  I have to talk to you.
L657890	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I have no family.
L657889	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
L657824	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Madmartigan.
L657823	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Sorsha.
L657743	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I don't believe you.
L657742	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Because it's true.
L657741	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I love you.
L657740	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Say what?
L657739	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Why did you say that?
L657736	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I'm not going to let this baby die.
L657735	u8935	m608	SORSHA	You're a fool.  Now put her back.
L657704	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Too bad you're not more like your father.
L657703	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I do what I'm told.
L657633	u8935	m608	SORSHA	My step-father's going to tear you apart.
L657632	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
L657513	u8935	m608	SORSHA	You're not a woman.
L657512	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Gawd...you're...beautiful...
L657508	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Why not?
L657507	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Why not?
L657506	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I can't.
L657504	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Let me see it.
L657503	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I can't.
L657501	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	No.  I mean yes.
L657500	u8935	m608	SORSHA	You!  Are you the mother of that child?
L657877	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
L657876	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
L657651	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	As above, so below.
L657650	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	We're a tiny version of all that?
L657636	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
L657635	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Who is that girl, anyway?
L657621	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	I will!  But I need help!
L657620	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Then you get us out of here.
L657616	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	He turned that monster into stone!
L657615	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	He's no magician.
L657614	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
L657887	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
L657886	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I don't know, Willow.
L657882	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
L657881	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
L657880	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
L657796	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Ahhh!
L657795	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Watch it!
L657794	u8937	m608	WILLOW	That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
L657793	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	She's a bird, Willow.
L657792	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
L657791	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
L657789	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
L657788	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Want me to carry Elora?
L657787	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
L657696	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
L657695	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You?
L657685	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
L657684	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	She's in love.
L657682	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Well what did she say?
L657681	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She asked about you, Madmartigan.
L657680	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Willow!
L657679	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She said lots of thing.s
L657678	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
L657677	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Who?
L657676	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Did she ask about me?
L657649	u8937	m608	WILLOW	The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
L657648	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
L657623	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I won't.
L657622	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'll help you...!
L657550	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
L657549	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You?
L657548	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
L657542	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
L657541	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan, I need your help.
L657539	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
L657538	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
L657537	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
L657531	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I did?
L657530	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
L657529	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
L657528	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Elora Danan!
L657527	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
L657525	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I thought you had her!
L657524	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Where's the baby??
L657510	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Because she's sick.
L657509	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Because she's sick.
L657499	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Time to leave.
L657498	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Time to change her diaper.
L657495	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Nursemaid?!
L657494	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
L657493	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Hey!  Give me that baby!
L657486	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Where the hell did you come from?
L657485	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You!!
L657388	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
L657387	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
L657385	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Of course!  I promise!
L657384	u8937	m608	WILLOW	And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
L657383	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Absolutely!
L657382	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Fresh goat's milk.
L657381	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I will.
L657380	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You gotta promise to feed her.
L657377	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You don't know anything about ba- bies.
L657376	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
L657375	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I hate this.
L657374	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
L657372	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Friend of yours?
L657371	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
L657354	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What is it?
L657353	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	You hear trouble.
L657352	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What's that?  I hear something!
L657351	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
L657350	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Are you a warrior?
L657349	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Smells like a battle.
L657343	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
L657342	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You all right?
L657335	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
L657334	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Farmer.
L657333	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	You a woodcutter?
L657329	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I don't know.
L657328	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
L657327	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Are you okay?
L657326	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Thanks for your help, Peck.
L657320	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
L657319	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Hey!  Somebody's coming!
L657316	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I have to give this baby to some- body.
L657315	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Why.
L657314	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
L657312	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Miserable Pecks.
L657311	u8937	m608	WILLOW	You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
L657310	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Don't make me angry, Peck.
L657309	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Good.  How long will it take?
L657308	u8931	m608	MADMARTIGAN	Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
L657283	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
L657282	u8932	m608	RANON	I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
L657281	u8932	m608	RANON	Are you scared?
L657280	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
L657279	u8932	m608	RANON	Dada, what's a daikini?
L657207	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Absolutely not.
L657206	u8932	m608	RANON	Can't we keep it, Dada?
L657203	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
L657202	u8932	m608	RANON	It's not a Nelwyn baby.
L657900	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Courage, Willow.
L657899	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Patience, Willow.
L657896	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Surrender!!
L657895	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Time is running out.
L657865	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She's too powerful, Raziel
L657864	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
L657863	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
L657853	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Just do it!
L657852	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Why?
L657851	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
L657816	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
L657815	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
L657812	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	More!  More!
L657811	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
L657809	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
L657808	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How??
L657805	u8937	m608	WILLOW	There's nobody here.
L657804	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Tir Asleen.
L657722	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
L657721	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I just wanted to test it first.
L657720	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Now use it.
L657719	u8937	m608	WILLOW	His will.
L657718	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
L657716	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
L657715	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What'd you bit me for!!
L657714	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Shhhhh!
L657713	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Ouch!!
L657712	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
L657711	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Oooh, this smells terrible.
L657694	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Me!
L657693	u8937	m608	WILLOW	But what am I gonna transform??
L657692	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	The art of transformation!
L657691	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
L657690	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
L657689	u8937	m608	WILLOW	The limitless power of...
L657688	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	What's the magician's weapon?
L657687	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
L657686	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
L657655	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
L657654	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How am I gonna do that?
L657653	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Burn it to a fine ash.
L657652	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm all finished.  Now what?
L657647	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
L657646	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
L657645	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
L657644	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
L657640	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
L657639	u8937	m608	WILLOW	What do I need for that?
L657638	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
L657626	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Then I will teach you.
L657625	u8937	m608	WILLOW	That's all I ever wanted!
L657624	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	You must learn magic.
L657619	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
L657618	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No.
L657617	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Did *you* give that acorn its power?
L657597	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Kill him!
L657596	u8937	m608	WILLOW	No!
L657595	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Kill him!
L657586	u8937	m608	WILLOW	We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
L657585	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	What do you want!
L657581	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
L657580	u8933	m608	RAZIEL	Who are you!  Who are you!
L657612	u8934	m608	ROOL	Ouch!  Let go of me!
L657611	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Get back here, Rool!
L657610	u8934	m608	ROOL	Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
L657609	u8936	m608	TEEMO	We gotta follow them.
L657556	u8934	m608	ROOL	Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
L657555	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Are you sure?
L657474	u8934	m608	ROOL	Me neither!
L657473	u8936	m608	TEEMO	I'm not going in there.
L657417	u8934	m608	ROOL	He never misses.
L657416	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
L657411	u8934	m608	ROOL	Somebody has to do it.
L657410	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
L657670	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Here.  Hold her.
L657669	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
L657668	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She's hungry.
L657665	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I don't know much about him.
L657664	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Who is he?
L657663	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Madmartigan.
L657662	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Who is that horrible friend of yours?
L657661	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
L657660	u8935	m608	SORSHA	I changed her already!
L657659	u8937	m608	WILLOW	She needs to be changed.
L657631	u8935	m608	SORSHA	Shut up.
L657630	u8937	m608	WILLOW	If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
L657584	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
L657583	u8937	m608	WILLOW	This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
L657576	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
L657575	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Obviously.
L657568	u8936	m608	TEEMO	The sorceress.
L657567	u8937	m608	WILLOW	We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
L657560	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How are we going to get out there?
L657559	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
L657468	u8937	m608	WILLOW	How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
L657467	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Hey, careful there!
L657436	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I can't see anything--she's too bright!
L657435	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Talk!  Say something!
L657429	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
L657428	u8937	m608	WILLOW	This is not going well.
L657424	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Why not?
L657423	u8936	m608	TEEMO	Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
L657422	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Ohhh, I hate this.
L657415	u8936	m608	TEEMO	No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
L657414	u8937	m608	WILLOW	I'm getting her out of there!
L657408	u8936	m608	TEEMO	You're the guardian, aren't you?
L657407	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Who??
L657406	u8936	m608	TEEMO	She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
L657405	u8937	m608	WILLOW	Queen Cherlindrea?
L657404	u8936	m608	TEEMO	We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
L660491	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
L660490	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
L660483	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L660482	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
L660481	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
L660477	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Yes, darling.
L660476	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
L660475	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
L660474	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
L659471	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
L659470	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!
L659442	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
L659441	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659440	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
L659439	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
L659385	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- all right.
L659384	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
L659383	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
L659382	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
L659379	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
L659378	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
L659377	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
L659376	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
L659375	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Aunt Em!
L659465	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
L659464	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Uhh -- yeah --
L659390	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659389	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, I hope we got them in time.
L659388	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659387	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
L659386	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
L659431	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
L659430	u8952	m610	HICKORY	All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
L659429	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
L659428	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
L659427	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
L659426	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
L659605	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	You'll be hist...
L659604	u8955	m610	MAYOR	From now on you'll be history
L659596	u8955	m610	MAYOR	Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
L659595	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	If any!
L659594	u8955	m610	MAYOR	Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
L659589	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	Is morally, ethic'ly
L659588	u8955	m610	MAYOR	If she?
L659587	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	If she...
L659586	u8955	m610	MAYOR	To see?
L659585	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	But we've got to verify it legally To see...
L659584	u8955	m610	MAYOR	As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
L660354	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	You are?
L660353	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
L660352	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Who are you?
L660351	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	... -- Oz -- has spoken!
L660342	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Do you presume to criticize the....
L660341	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
L660334	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Not so fast!  Not....
L660333	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
L660332	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	...resourceful!
L660330	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Oh ....
L660329	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
L660328	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	...have you come back?
L660087	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
L660086	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
L660085	u8957	m610	OZ'S VOICE	Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
L660084	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Our echo.
L660440	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Goodbye, folks!
L660439	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L660438	u8964	m610	WIZARD	I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
L660437	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
L660427	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
L660426	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh!
L660425	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
L660361	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh ....
L660360	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
L660357	u8964	m610	WIZARD	No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
L660356	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't believe you!
L660355	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uhhhh -- yes...
L659423	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
L659422	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Are you all right, Dorothy?
L659421	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
L659415	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
L659414	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Hickory!
L659413	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Who did it? Now wait a minute.
L659412	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!
L659411	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
L659410	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	This?
L659409	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
L659408	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
L659407	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
L660212	u8963	m610	WITCH	Catch him, you fool!
L660211	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Run, Toto, run!
L660208	u8963	m610	WITCH	No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
L660207	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
L660206	u8963	m610	WITCH	Ahh!  Ah!
L660205	u8963	m610	WITCH	That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
L660204	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
L660203	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
L660202	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
L660201	u8963	m610	WITCH	Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
L660200	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, please give me back my dog!
L660199	u8963	m610	WITCH	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
L660198	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
L659620	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
L659619	u8963	m610	WITCH	...didn't you?
L660472	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
L660471	u8951	m610	GLINDA	"And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."""
L660470	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
L660469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm ready now.
L660468	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
L660467	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you ready now?
L660462	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
L660461	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Whenever you wish.
L660460	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now?
L660459	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Toto, too.
L660458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...Toto, too?
L660448	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have?
L660447	u8951	m610	GLINDA	You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
L660446	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
L659644	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
L659643	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But, how do I start for Emerald City?
L659642	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
L659641	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, I'm afraid I didn't.
L659640	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
L659639	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
L659638	u8951	m610	GLINDA	No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
L659637	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
L659636	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
L659615	u8951	m610	GLINDA	That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
L659614	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I thought you said she was dead.
L659565	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
L659564	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
L659563	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
L659557	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
L659556	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Toto's my dog.
L659554	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh!  Well....
L659553	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
L659552	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
L660489	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But you couldn't have been, could you?
L660488	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- 
L659533	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
L659532	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
L659531	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
L659530	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you....
L659529	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
L659528	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- no!
L659527	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...bed.
L659526	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
L659525	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...paper?
L659524	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Has it poppies on the wall....
L659523	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...room --
L659521	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What's she doing now?
L659520	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Uh-huh.
L659519	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
L659517	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Me?
L659516	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
L659515	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659514	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
L659513	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's right.  What's she doing?
L659512	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Her -- her name is Emily.
L659511	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...That's Aunt Em.
L659510	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...her face is careworn.
L659507	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- yes.
L659506	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's our farm!
L659499	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
L659498	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
L659497	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659496	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, they won't - honestly.
L659495	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Aw, come, come, come --
L659494	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
L659493	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659492	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
L659491	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
L659488	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
L659487	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Yes --
L659486	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
L659485	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
L659484	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why --
L659483	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
L659482	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How did you guess?
L659481	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
L659473	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Stop her!
L659472	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
L659469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
L659468	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
L659467	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659466	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Now you're seeing reason.
L659458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
L659457	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
L660464	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
L660463	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
L660405	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Look -- it ticks!
L660404	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.
L660403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...!
L660402	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
L660337	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	You've had plenty of time already!
L660336	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
L660279	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I knew you would!
L660278	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Dorothy!
L660156	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
L660155	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh! Something bit me, too!
L660147	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
L660146	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No.  Why only --  Oh --
L660070	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
L660069	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, he's just ascared again.
L659992	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659991	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Can't that female take no for an answer?
L659881	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sure he could give you some courage.
L659880	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And him a brain.
L659853	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
L659852	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What sort of an animal is that?
L659851	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And bears!
L659835	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659834	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	We might.
L659825	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
L659824	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
L659811	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh-oh-
L659810	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
L659809	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659808	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh! Oh!
L659807	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh - I'll get it!
L659806	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
L659805	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
L659804	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
L659803	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh! They're - they're gone now.
L659793	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
L659792	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
L659791	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
L659788	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
L659787	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
L659786	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
L659785	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
L659778	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	All hollow.  Oh --
L659777	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659772	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --!
L659771	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
L659770	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, you're perfect now.
L659769	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
L659768	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
L659767	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
L659766	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
L659765	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...Oh, did that hurt?
L659764	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh --
L659763	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh...
L659762	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
L659756	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	My mouth -- my mouth!

L659752	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oil can....
L659751	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Did you say something?
L659750	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oil can.....Oil can....
L659850	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my! 
L659849	u8961	m610	TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY	Lions and tigers and bears!
L659848	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my!

L660465	u8954	m610	LION	Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
L660444	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
L660443	u8954	m610	LION	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
L660442	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now I'll never get home!
L660409	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
L660408	u8954	m610	LION	...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!

L660166	u8954	m610	LION	I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
L660165	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
L660164	u8954	m610	LION	As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
L660160	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
L660159	u8954	m610	LION	That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
L660138	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L660137	u8954	m610	LION	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.

L660074	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But why?  Why?
L660073	u8954	m610	LION	I'd sooner wait outside.
L660072	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
L660071	u8954	m610	LION	I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
L660043	u8954	m610	LION	I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
L660042	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Supposin' you met an elephant?
L660041	u8954	m610	LION	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
L660040	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How about a hippopotamus?
L660037	u8954	m610	LION	Not nobody, not nohow!

L659894	u8954	m610	LION	The nerve.
L659893	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	A home --
L659887	u8954	m610	LION	Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
L659886	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.
L659885	u8954	m610	LION	...has been simply unbearable.
L659873	u8954	m610	LION	You're right -- I am a coward.
L659872	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
L659871	u8954	m610	LION	Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
L659870	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
L659869	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, but you tried to.
L659868	u8954	m610	LION	What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
L659425	u8953	m610	HUNK	What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?

L659405	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
L659404	u8953	m610	HUNK	Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
L659403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have so got brains.
L659402	u8953	m610	HUNK	Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
L660304	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!

L659998	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Dear, whatever shall we do?
L659943	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
L659942	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
L659941	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
L659940	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- there --
L659937	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659936	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
L659914	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
L659913	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...along.
L659879	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
L659878	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
L659833	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
L659832	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
L659831	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
L659823	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
L659822	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
L659819	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
L659818	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
L659790	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
L659789	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
L659760	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes --- there.
L659759	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	The other side....
L659758	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Here -- here --
L659757	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	He said his mouth.
L659754	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
L659753	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oil can what?
L659749	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Oh -- look --
L659748	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What?
L659747	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
L659746	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659745	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
L659735	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
L659734	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
L659726	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz!
L659725	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	To Oz?
L659724	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
L659723	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
L659722	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
L659720	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
L659719	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't blame you for that.
L659718	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
L659717	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
L659716	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- that's true.
L659715	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
L659714	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
L659713	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659712	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You're going to see a Wizard?
L659711	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
L659710	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Where's Kansas?
L659709	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659708	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They would?
L659707	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
L659695	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
L659694	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Did I scare you?
L659693	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
L659692	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...free!
L659691	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	My, it's good to be....
L659690	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh --
L659689	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
L659688	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- does it hurt you?
L659687	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
L659686	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohh!
L659685	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Ohhhh --
L659684	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.
L659680	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
L659679	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
L659678	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
L659661	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It's pleasant down that way, too.
L659660	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...don't talk.
L659632	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
L659631	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
L659630	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
L659626	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's too late!  There they....
L659625	u8963	m610	WITCH	The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
L659623	u8963	m610	WITCH	The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
L659622	u8951	m610	GLINDA	...ting the ruby slippers?
L659618	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
L659617	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Leave her alone!
L659616	u8963	m610	WITCH	Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
L660422	u8954	m610	LION	It did?
L660421	u8964	m610	WIZARD	...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
L660415	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
L660414	u8954	m610	LION	Dorothy next!

L660359	u8954	m610	LION	Yeah!

L660272	u8954	m610	LION	Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
L660271	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Stop pushing!
L660260	u8954	m610	LION	Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
L660259	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on -- I've got another idea.
L660248	u8954	m610	LION	Now...
L660247	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Up!
L660240	u8954	m610	LION	All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
L660239	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	That's right.
L660238	u8954	m610	LION	I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?

L660233	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I've got a plan how to get in there.
L660189	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
L660188	u8954	m610	LION	They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
L660083	u8954	m610	LION	What was that?
L660082	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Here --   Come on.
L660081	u8954	m610	LION	I -- Oh --

L660078	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What happened?
L660068	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What's the matter?
L660067	u8954	m610	LION	Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
L660062	u8954	m610	LION	I don't know.
L660061	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Who at?
L660060	u8954	m610	LION	Would...would it do any good if I roared?
L660045	u8954	m610	LION	I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
L660044	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What if it were a brontosaurus?
L659925	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't you start it, too!
L659924	u8954	m610	LION	Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.

L660217	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
L660192	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
L660191	u8954	m610	LION	Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.

L659451	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?

L660187	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, that's you all over.
L660186	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!

L659908	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
L659907	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
L659906	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Hurry -- hurry --
L659905	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on -- come on --
L659892	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	A heart --
L659891	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Then I'm sure to get a brain --
L659889	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'd be clever as a gizzard --
L659888	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'd be gentle as a lizard --
L659837	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
L659836	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Animals that -- that eat straw?
L659829	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	To Oz!
L659828	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz?
L659827	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	We do.
L659826	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	That's right.
L659821	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	No, sir!
L659820	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No, sir!
L659802	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
L659801	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
L659774	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
L659773	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Beautiful!  What an echo!
L660392	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
L660391	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	How can I ever thank you enough?
L660388	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Th.D.?
L660387	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
L660381	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You promised us real things -- a real...
L660380	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well --
L660373	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660372	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
L660371	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660370	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
L660369	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660368	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about us?
L660367	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes.
L660366	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It makes you nervous?
L660365	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
L660436	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Help!
L660435	u8964	m610	WIZARD	-- Ruined my exit!
L660434	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
L660433	u8964	m610	WIZARD	This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
L660432	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Stop that dog!
L660398	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes -- ....
L660397	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	But I still want one.
L660396	u8964	m610	WIZARD	As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
L663447	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	Please.
L663446	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What?!
L663445	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
L663444	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I would like to use the bathroom --
L663443	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
L663442	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Why?  What's the problem?
L663441	u8975	m612	ADAMSON	Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
L663440	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
L663643	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
L663642	u8976	m612	ANALYST	We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
L663641	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	"What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter"" theory?"
L663640	u8976	m612	ANALYST	As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
L663638	u8976	m612	ANALYST	Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
L663637	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	What kind of time frame are we talking about?
L663636	u8976	m612	ANALYST	Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
L663635	u8987	m612	PRESIDENT	What about our end?
L663303	u8977	m612	BURNS	They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
L663302	u8981	m612	HYDE	Washington?
L663301	u8977	m612	BURNS	He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
L663300	u8981	m612	HYDE	Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
L663299	u8977	m612	BURNS	No idea who's behind this?
L663298	u8981	m612	HYDE	You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
L663297	u8977	m612	BURNS	Had a lot of blood in him.
L663846	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
L663845	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
L663829	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	We don't know that.
L663828	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	God isn't there to do it.
L663827	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
L663826	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
L663825	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
L663824	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Who is she?  Do you know her?
L663823	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	A whore fucking.
L663779	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
L663778	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
L663777	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Wrong answers?
L663776	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
L663775	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Don't call me that.
L663774	u8978	m612	DR. LONG	Walter --
L664176	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
L664175	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
L663366	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
L663365	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
L663363	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
L663362	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What's your theory?
L663361	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
L663360	u8990	m612	VEIDT	"Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen."
L663357	u8990	m612	VEIDT	We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
L663356	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The bearer of bad news.
L663352	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Hello, Adrian.
L663351	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Hi, Jon.
L664185	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
L664184	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
L664183	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
L664182	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon --
L664169	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Veidts complex.
L664168	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, where are we?
L664155	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The south pole.  Times flowing backwards.
L664154	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- what??
L664153	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . .
L664141	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Cured, yes.
L664140	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What -- am I --
L664139	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
L664138	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
L664137	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
L664136	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I won't do that.
L664135	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
L664134	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	You're the only human being I care for.
L664133	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
L664132	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
L664131	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, I do not want to hear it.
L664082	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
L664081	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
L664080	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
L664079	u8985	m612	LAURIE	"Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?"
L664078	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Because --
L664077	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
L664076	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Always.  Ever since the day I died.
L664075	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
L664074	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
L664073	u8985	m612	LAURIE	But you knew that I'd -- die.
L664072	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
L664071	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
L664070	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
L664069	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
L664067	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
L664066	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
L664065	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
L664064	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
L664062	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You -- you know about me and Dan?
L664061	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
L664060	u8985	m612	LAURIE	This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
L664047	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
L664046	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
L664041	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
L664040	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon, no -- I can't --
L664039	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
L664038	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Collect me?
L664037	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
L663397	u8985	m612	LAURIE	. . . And just how would you manage that?
L663396	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I could stay and go.
L663395	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Mm hmm.
L663394	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Would you like me to stay?
L663392	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Not yet, there's plenty of time.
L663391	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
L663390	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	I'm here, Laurie.
L663359	u8979	m612	DR. MANHATTAN	Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
L663358	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Blake?  Dead?
L664172	u8990	m612	VEIDT	We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
L664171	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
L664170	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
L664165	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
L664164	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What if youre wrong??
L664163	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Im not.
L664162	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	And what if youre wrong?
L664161	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
L664150	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
L664149	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian -- you've lost it.
L664148	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
L664147	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What is it?  How does it work?
L664146	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
L664128	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
L664127	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
L664126	u8990	m612	VEIDT	It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
L664117	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
L664116	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What??
L664111	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
L664110	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The missing scientists.
L664109	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
L663803	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
L663802	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
L663801	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	She's with me.
L663800	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
L663799	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Who?
L663343	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Good night.
L663342	u8990	m612	VEIDT	You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
L663341	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No.  I just wanted you to --
L663340	u8990	m612	VEIDT	If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
L663339	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
L663338	u8990	m612	VEIDT	You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
L663337	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
L663336	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
L663335	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
L663334	u8990	m612	VEIDT	My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
L663333	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
L664215	u8985	m612	LAURIE	We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
L664214	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
L664213	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan -- what do we do now?
L664201	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Everything's changed --
L664200	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Those cars.  What year is this??
L664199	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, is this -- is this New York??
L664196	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Where did he go?
L664195	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He saved himself.  He changed the past.
L664179	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
L664178	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What was he doing?
L664018	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
L664017	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Welcome back, Night Owl.
L664001	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
L664000	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
L663985	u8985	m612	LAURIE	My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
L663984	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I think he's going to the john.
L663983	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What's he doing?
L663949	u8985	m612	LAURIE	. . . What??
L663948	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
L663947	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
L663946	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
L663945	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's because --
L663944	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
L663943	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Yes you are.
L663942	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
L663941	u8985	m612	LAURIE	The costumes.  Am I right?
L663940	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What?
L663923	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
L663922	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're practically on us . . .
L663921	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
L663920	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
L663915	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	All right.  Mission accomplished.
L663914	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're following us.
L663891	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
L663890	u8985	m612	LAURIE	It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
L663889	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What the hell -- ?
L663869	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Okay!
L663868	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	This'd better not be what I think it is.
L663867	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Don't look.  Turn around.
L663866	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What are you up to?
L663865	u8985	m612	LAURIE	God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
L663864	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
L663863	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
L663861	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You and me.
L663860	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
L663859	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
L663858	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Antarctica??
L663857	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
L663854	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
L663853	u8985	m612	LAURIE	The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
L663849	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Memory lane.
L663848	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
L663810	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
L663809	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
L663808	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Laurie --
L663807	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
L663806	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	-- What is it.
L663805	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
L663804	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
L663758	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
L663757	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
L663754	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
L663753	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
L663725	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
L663724	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	. . . What?
L663723	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
L663722	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Old?
L663721	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
L663720	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
L663719	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
L663718	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
L663706	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Play one.  Educate yourself.
L663705	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
L663704	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
L663697	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
L663696	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	His . . . whatever.
L663695	u8985	m612	LAURIE	His what?
L663663	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
L663662	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
L663658	u8985	m612	LAURIE	You're sure?
L663657	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
L663656	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
L663654	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
L663653	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Maybe not, but why take chances?
L663652	u8985	m612	LAURIE	They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
L663651	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
L663650	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
L663649	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
L663432	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
L663431	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
L663430	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
L663429	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
L663428	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
L663427	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
L663426	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Damn straight!  We were heroes.
L663425	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Damn straight.
L663420	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
L663419	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
L663418	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
L663417	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
L663416	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
L663415	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
L664160	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
L664159	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
L664108	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
L664107	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
L664106	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
L664088	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
L664087	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	What caused it?
L664086	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
L664085	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	What happened?
L664057	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
L664056	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
L664055	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	SHUT UP, Rorschach.
L664054	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Coward.  Giving up.
L664053	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
L664052	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
L664051	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
L664044	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't think she's coming with us.
L664043	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Where's Laurie?
L664024	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
L664023	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
L664022	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
L664021	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
L664020	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What do you mean, frame-up?
L664019	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
L663999	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
L663998	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	What new information?
L663997	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
L663996	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
L663987	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
L663986	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	. . . That was quick.
L663327	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
L663326	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
L663325	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
L663324	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	So do I.  So do you.
L663322	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
L663321	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
L663319	u8980	m612	DREIBERG	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
L663318	u8988	m612	RORSCHACH	Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
L663545	u8983	m612	JON	My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
L663544	u8982	m612	JANEY	-- What?
L663543	u8983	m612	JON	I can fix it.
L663539	u8983	m612	JON	Janey, will you marry me?
L663538	u8982	m612	JANEY	Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
L663536	u8982	m612	JANEY	We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
L663535	u8983	m612	JON	Nothing.  What were you going to say?
L663534	u8982	m612	JANEY	We should get back --  What?
L663533	u8983	m612	JON	Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
L663532	u8982	m612	JANEY	Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
L663531	u8983	m612	JON	Nothing wrong with ketchup.
L663530	u8982	m612	JANEY	With lots of ketchup?
L663529	u8983	m612	JON	I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
L663787	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Isn't it true that you --
L663786	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I did not.  Now get out of my way!
L663785	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Did you know he was back on the streets?
L663784	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No comment.
L663682	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
L663681	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
L663680	u8990	m612	VEIDT	No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
L663679	u8984	m612	JUSTINE	Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
L663678	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
L663599	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
L663598	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Jon??  You mean he's --
L663597	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
L663596	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
L663595	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
L663594	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Am I free to go?
L663593	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
L663468	u8985	m612	LAURIE	That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
L663467	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
L663466	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What does this mean?  What does it --
L663465	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	I'm terribly sorry.
L663464	u8985	m612	LAURIE	What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
L663463	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
L663462	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Then why don't you ask him?!?
L663461	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	"You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --"
L663460	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know their real names!
L663459	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
L663458	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I don't know their real names.
L663457	u8989	m612	SCHMIDT	Their real names, please.
L663379	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I'm sorry about Blake.
L663378	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Maybe I'll do that.
L663377	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
L663376	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
L663375	u8990	m612	VEIDT	What about you?
L663374	u8985	m612	LAURIE	I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
L663373	u8990	m612	VEIDT	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
L663372	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
L663371	u8990	m612	VEIDT	He's a little farther gone every time.
L663370	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Please.
L663369	u8990	m612	VEIDT	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
L663368	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
L663350	u8985	m612	LAURIE	He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
L663349	u8990	m612	VEIDT	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
L663348	u8985	m612	LAURIE	Don't rub it in.  I live here.
