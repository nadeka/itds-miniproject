L2181	u12	m1	ALONSO	Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
L2180	u23	m1	SAILOR	We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
L2179	u12	m1	ALONSO	We should have seen land.
L2177	u23	m1	SAILOR	We'll all go crazy...
L2176	u12	m1	ALONSO	He's the devil's child...
L2175	u12	m1	ALONSO	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
L2174	u23	m1	SAILOR	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
L2173	u12	m1	ALONSO	What are you listening to, chicken ass?
L2172	u12	m1	ALONSO	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
L2171	u23	m1	SAILOR	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
L2170	u12	m1	ALONSO	I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
L2025	u13	m1	AROJAZ	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
L2024	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
L2023	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
L2022	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
L2020	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
L2019	u13	m1	AROJAZ	If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
L2016	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
L2015	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
L2014	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
L2012	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If they agree to follow me, yes.
L2011	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Your life, and that of others!
L2010	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
L2006	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Excellency, you are right.
L2005	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
L1993	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
L1992	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am, Your Eminence
L1991	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
L1990	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
L1989	u13	m1	AROJAZ	You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
L2524	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
L2523	u13	m1	AROJAZ	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
L2522	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You can see for yourself.
L2275	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
L2274	u13	m1	AROJAZ	It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
L2031	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
L2030	u13	m1	AROJAZ	He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
L2029	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
L2028	u13	m1	AROJAZ	The Judgment is ours!
L2027	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
L2540	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
L2539	u14	m1	BEATRIX	What is it, now?  Tell me...
L2538	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I am busy inside.
L2537	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Can't you stay with us a little?
L2474	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
L2473	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They took everything...
L2472	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They tried... but I didn't let them.
L2471	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
L2320	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
L2319	u14	m1	BEATRIX	You don't usually ask.
L2318	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
L2123	u14	m1	BEATRIX	That's something you can't decide.
L2122	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't want you to wait for me.
L2121	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
L2119	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Thank God...
L2118	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	She said yes.
L1986	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I find that hard to believe.
L1985	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
L1984	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
L1983	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Are we going to argue?
L1982	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
L1981	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I haven't given you much of a life.
L1980	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I know.
L1979	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I could be gone for years.
L2432	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
L2431	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
L2430	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
L2429	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How far from here?
L2426	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
L2425	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Viceroy of the West Indies.
L2424	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Appointment to what?
L2423	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	My letters of appointment.
L2422	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... I remember...
L2421	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
L2293	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
L2292	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	May I ask by whom?
L2291	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
L2290	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
L2552	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
L2551	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
L2550	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
L2549	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
L2548	u17	m1	FERNANDO	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
L2547	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What does he say?
L2542	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
L2541	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What are you listening to?
L2501	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
L2500	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Father...
L2485	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Not bad.
L2484	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How are you feeling, Fernando?
L2440	u17	m1	FERNANDO	This time with me!
L2439	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to explore the mainland.
L2131	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
L2130	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
L2129	u17	m1	FERNANDO	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
L2128	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There'll be a time.
L2127	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want to go with you!
L2469	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them created by people like me.
L2468	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
L2467	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you see?
L2466	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Look out of that window.
L2465	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
L2464	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Call them.
L2463	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	All I have to do is call the guards.
L2301	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
L2300	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What...?  Do I have so many already?
L2299	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
L2297	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
L2296	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
L2295	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
L2287	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... for a commoner?
L2286	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You defend yourself admirably...
L2282	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
L2281	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
L2110	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
L2109	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
L2108	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Then you are too ambitious.
L2107	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'm not bargaining!
L2106	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
L2105	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
L2104	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	No?
L2103	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No...
L2410	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You never learned how to speak my language.
L2409	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
L2394	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You did the same to your God!
L2393	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
L2343	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ask him if he will help.
L2342	u25	m1	UTAPAN	He understands.
L2341	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
L2260	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
L2259	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says...
L2258	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... and also to bring medicine.
L2257	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- he has a God.
L2256	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To bring the word of God.
L2255	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Why?
L2254	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thousands.
L2253	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- how many?
L2251	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
L2250	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief knows.
L2249	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell the Chief we thank him.
L2248	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You come!  You speak first!
L2239	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Island.  Far.
L2238	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
L2237	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Say not here!  Cuba!
L2535	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
L2534	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Oh?  So you are a new man?
L2533	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	New worlds create new people.
L2532	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I knew you would.
L2531	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to disagree.
L2526	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll always be older than me, Father.
L2525	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I suppose we're both old men now.
L2145	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Give me absolution.
L2144	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I believed in you...
L2143	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You are bound by an oath, Father.
L2142	u19	m1	MARCHENA	My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
L2141	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
L2140	u19	m1	MARCHENA	May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
L2139	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
L2138	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How long?
L2137	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
L2136	u19	m1	MARCHENA	What are you saying?
L2135	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
L2134	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I am listening, my son.
L2133	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
L2132	u19	m1	MARCHENA	In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
L2046	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!  Don't!
L2045	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them!  Just lies!
L2042	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
L2041	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!
L2040	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn God!
L2039	u19	m1	MARCHENA	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
L2038	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
L2037	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
L1969	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
L1968	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
L1967	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
L1966	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Passion is something one cannot control!
L1965	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Father Marchena!
L1964	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
L1963	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
L1962	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	So was Christ!
L1961	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Esdras is a Jew.
L1960	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
L1959	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?
L1958	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
L1957	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
L1952	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
L1951	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Why do you wish to sail west?
L1950	u19	m1	MARCHENA	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
L1949	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How did you manage it?
L1948	u19	m1	MARCHENA	That's what it says.
L1947	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... That's in a week!
L1943	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
L1942	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
L2459	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
L2458	u18	m1	ISABEL	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
L2457	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thank you.
L2456	u18	m1	ISABEL	But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
L2280	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
L2279	u18	m1	ISABEL	Do they have such thoughts?
L2086	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
L2085	u18	m1	ISABEL	How old are you, Senor Colon?
L2082	u18	m1	ISABEL	A woman?
L2081	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
L2080	u18	m1	ISABEL	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
L2079	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	May I speak freely?
L2077	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Surely you can do anything you want.
L2076	u18	m1	ISABEL	I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
L2075	u18	m1	ISABEL	That she was impregnable.
L2074	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What did they say about Granada before today?
L2073	u18	m1	ISABEL	The ocean is uncrossable?
L2072	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
L2071	u18	m1	ISABEL	I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
L2389	u21	m1	MOXICA	You will regret this.
L2388	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
L2387	u21	m1	MOXICA	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
L2386	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
L2348	u21	m1	MOXICA	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
L2347	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
L2346	u21	m1	MOXICA	My horse doesn't work.
L2345	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We can't raise the wheel without it.
L2333	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
L2332	u21	m1	MOXICA	We don't need to know.
L2331	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
L2329	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
L2328	u21	m1	MOXICA	We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
L2278	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
L2277	u21	m1	MOXICA	And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
L2492	u20	m1	MENDEZ	We can't be.
L2491	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
L2490	u20	m1	MENDEZ	What's he doing?
L2165	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Twenty eight.
L2164	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you read?
L2160	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Come over here.
L2159	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
L2158	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And what do you think Mendez?
L2157	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
L2155	u20	m1	MENDEZ	God be with us admiral.
L2154	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
L2211	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You're right.  Let the men decide.
L2210	u22	m1	PINZON	You tell that to them!
L2209	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
L2208	u22	m1	PINZON	You bloody...
L2207	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
L2206	u22	m1	PINZON	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
L2205	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
L2204	u22	m1	PINZON	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
L2203	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The land is there.  I know it!
L2202	u22	m1	PINZON	We're lost!
L2201	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You think I don't know that?
L2200	u22	m1	PINZON	We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
L2199	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
L2198	u22	m1	PINZON	You must be mad...!
L2197	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Six days ago, yes.
L2196	u22	m1	PINZON	You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
L2065	u22	m1	PINZON	Immediately.
L2064	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Where can I meet this man?
L2462	u18	m1	ISABEL	Because he is not afraid of me.
L2461	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Then why?
L2460	u18	m1	ISABEL	I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
L2419	u18	m1	ISABEL	And who would you think of, for such a task?
L2418	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	He must be replaced.
L2417	u18	m1	ISABEL	Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
L2415	u18	m1	ISABEL	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
L2414	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
L2377	u18	m1	ISABEL	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
L2376	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
L2116	u18	m1	ISABEL	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
L2115	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	... Into a monk...
L2113	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
L2112	u18	m1	ISABEL	You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
L1931	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Yes, Your Majesty.
L1930	u18	m1	ISABEL	Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
L109843	u628	m40	ARGYLE	They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
L109842	u632	m40	LEADER	Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
L109841	u628	m40	ARGYLE	My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
L109840	u632	m40	LEADER	What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
L109839	u628	m40	ARGYLE	We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
L109838	u632	m40	LEADER	Someone dead from this household?
L109855	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
L109854	u642	m40	WILLIAM	What are they doing?
L109851	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
L109850	u642	m40	WILLIAM	It was in Latin, sir.
L109849	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
L109848	u628	m40	ARGYLE	Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
L109847	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I don't want to leave.
L109846	u628	m40	ARGYLE	We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
L110416	u629	m40	CRAIG	He has already agreed to come.
L110415	u641	m40	WALLACE	I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
L110414	u629	m40	CRAIG	We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
L110413	u641	m40	WALLACE	So let the council swear publicly.
L110412	u629	m40	CRAIG	An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
L110411	u641	m40	WALLACE	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
L110410	u629	m40	CRAIG	Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
L110300	u629	m40	CRAIG	It is suicide.
L110299	u641	m40	WALLACE	With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
L110298	u629	m40	CRAIG	We cannot defeat this --
L110297	u641	m40	WALLACE	Peace?!
L110296	u629	m40	CRAIG	We must sue for peace.
L110295	u641	m40	WALLACE	A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
L110212	u629	m40	CRAIG	Invade?! That's impossible, it --
L110211	u641	m40	WALLACE	I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
L110210	u629	m40	CRAIG	But... what will you do?
L110438	u629	m40	CRAIG	You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
L110437	u639	m40	ROBERT	Longshanks promised!
L110428	u639	m40	ROBERT	He will. I know he will.
L110427	u629	m40	CRAIG	He won't come.
L110409	u629	m40	CRAIG	That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
L110408	u639	m40	ROBERT	The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
L110407	u629	m40	CRAIG	Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
L110406	u639	m40	ROBERT	If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
L110403	u629	m40	CRAIG	It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
L110402	u639	m40	ROBERT	He was a modest man.
L110401	u629	m40	CRAIG	May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
L110197	u629	m40	CRAIG	No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
L110196	u639	m40	ROBERT	Does anyone know his politics?
L109897	u639	m40	ROBERT	He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
L109896	u629	m40	CRAIG	A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
L109893	u629	m40	CRAIG	Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
L109892	u639	m40	ROBERT	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
L109891	u629	m40	CRAIG	Young Robert, we are honored --
L110360	u630	m40	EDWARD	You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
L110359	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
L110348	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
L110347	u630	m40	EDWARD	But if we have not caught Wallace --
L110346	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
L110345	u630	m40	EDWARD	The Scots will fight for us?
L110344	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
L110291	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
L110290	u630	m40	EDWARD	The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
L110241	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
L110240	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace has sacked York!
L110239	u630	m40	EDWARD	I have ordered conscriptions...
L110238	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
L110237	u630	m40	EDWARD	Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
L110236	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	What news of the north?
L110023	u630	m40	EDWARD	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
L110022	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
L110471	u630	m40	EDWARD	Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
L110470	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
L110468	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
L110467	u630	m40	EDWARD	You fancy him.
L110466	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
L110436	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
L110435	u638	m40	PRINCESS	When will his trial be?
L110434	u630	m40	EDWARD	Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
L110433	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Is it true? Wallace is captured?
L110370	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
L110369	u630	m40	EDWARD	The little cow is insane --
L110365	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
L110364	u630	m40	EDWARD	Wallace's followers.
L110363	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
L110362	u630	m40	EDWARD	You mock us with a smile?
L110361	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Good day to you, M'Lords.
L109887	u630	m40	EDWARD	You may.
L109886	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
L109885	u630	m40	EDWARD	Now, my flower, do you understand?
L109884	u630	m40	EDWARD	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
L109883	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No, M'lord.
L109880	u630	m40	EDWARD	All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
L109879	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
L109878	u630	m40	EDWARD	Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
L109876	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Scotland. He intends --
L109875	u630	m40	EDWARD	So I did! And what was so important about it?
L109874	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
L109873	u630	m40	EDWARD	What is it?!
L110426	u641	m40	WALLACE	No. One of us is enough.
L110425	u631	m40	HAMISH	Keep these. We're going too.
L110424	u641	m40	WALLACE	My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
L110423	u631	m40	HAMISH	Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
L110422	u641	m40	WALLACE	We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
L110421	u631	m40	HAMISH	That's just a dream, William!
L110420	u641	m40	WALLACE	Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
L110419	u631	m40	HAMISH	I don't want to be a martyr.
L110418	u641	m40	WALLACE	Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
L110417	u631	m40	HAMISH	You know it's a trap.
L110398	u631	m40	HAMISH	Your rest is making me exhausted.
L110397	u641	m40	WALLACE	I rest.
L110396	u631	m40	HAMISH	Rest, William.
L110376	u631	m40	HAMISH	We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
L110375	u641	m40	WALLACE	Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
L110317	u631	m40	HAMISH	Aye.
L110316	u641	m40	WALLACE	Stephen ready?
L110315	u641	m40	WALLACE	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
L110314	u631	m40	HAMISH	The Bruce is not coming, William.
L110052	u631	m40	HAMISH	Fourteen? --
L110051	u641	m40	WALLACE	We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
L110046	u641	m40	WALLACE	Hamish, I... thank...
L110045	u631	m40	HAMISH	I'll wait... back there.
L109927	u631	m40	HAMISH	I should'a remembered the eggs.
L109926	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Good to see you again.
L109916	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I will not.
L109915	u631	m40	HAMISH	You'll move
L109913	u631	m40	HAMISH	I could crush you like a roach.
L109912	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
L109911	u631	m40	HAMISH	That depends on the man.
L109910	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
L109907	u642	m40	WILLIAM	The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
L109906	u631	m40	HAMISH	Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
L109905	u642	m40	WILLIAM	You win.
L109904	u631	m40	HAMISH	Test of manhood.
L109833	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Aye, we'll get 'em.
L109832	u631	m40	HAMISH	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
L109831	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I wanna have supper waitin'.
L109830	u631	m40	HAMISH	Wanna stay with me tonight?
L109828	u642	m40	WILLIAM	It's up to us, Hamish!
L109827	u631	m40	HAMISH	With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
L109826	u642	m40	WILLIAM	They're English soldiers, ain't they?
L109825	u631	m40	HAMISH	Armed?
L109824	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Three, maybe more!
L109823	u631	m40	HAMISH	How many?
L109822	u642	m40	WILLIAM	They're coming!
L110089	u640	m40	STEPHEN	They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
L110088	u631	m40	HAMISH	We don't split up!
L110087	u640	m40	STEPHEN	We must run in different directions!
L110069	u640	m40	STEPHEN	A patriot!
L110068	u631	m40	HAMISH	A common thief.
L110067	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
L110063	u640	m40	STEPHEN	In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
L110062	u631	m40	HAMISH	Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
L110061	u640	m40	STEPHEN	All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
L110355	u633	m40	LEPER	All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
L110354	u639	m40	ROBERT	In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
L110353	u633	m40	LEPER	We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
L110352	u639	m40	ROBERT	He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
L110351	u633	m40	LEPER	So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
L110350	u639	m40	ROBERT	He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
L110349	u633	m40	LEPER	I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
L110368	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
L110367	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Let her speak.
L110366	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have faced him. Have you?
L110289	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
L110288	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
L110287	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
L110286	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
L110284	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Humbly, M'lord.
L110283	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
L110282	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
L110281	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
L110280	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
L110279	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
L110278	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. He did not.
L110277	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
L109869	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
L109868	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Shall I leave, M'lord?
L109867	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
L109866	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
L109865	u634	m40	LONGSHANKS	Where is my son?
L110447	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
L110446	u641	m40	WALLACE	I do not confess.
L110445	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
L110444	u641	m40	WALLACE	-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
L110443	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	It matters not, he is thy king!
L110442	u641	m40	WALLACE	Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
L110441	u635	m40	MAGISTRATE	Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
L110440	u641	m40	WALLACE	Treason. Against whom?
L109978	u636	m40	MARION	...Tonight!
L109977	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Then when?
L109976	u636	m40	MARION	My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
L109975	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Tonight then.
L109974	u636	m40	MARION	Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
L109973	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I've missed you.
L109967	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I will be with you, like this. Forever.
L109966	u636	m40	MARION	This night is too beautiful to have again.
L109965	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
L109964	u636	m40	MARION	You scare me.
L109963	u642	m40	WILLIAM	But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
L109962	u636	m40	MARION	Nor I!
L109961	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I'm not just saying it!
L109960	u636	m40	MARION	I... accept your proposal!
L109959	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I want... to marry you!
L109958	u642	m40	WILLIAM	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
L109957	u636	m40	MARION	Did it work?
L109956	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
L109955	u636	m40	MARION	You've been here before?
L109944	u636	m40	MARION	You are. And I'll come again.
L109943	u642	m40	WILLIAM	I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
L109942	u636	m40	MARION	Thank you for inviting.
L109941	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Thank you for accepting.
L109940	u636	m40	MARION	It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
L109939	u642	m40	WILLIAM	Your father doesn't like me, does he?
L110083	u636	m40	MARION	Wake up, William. Wake up!
L110082	u641	m40	WALLACE	I need you so much! I love you!
L110081	u636	m40	MARION	And I with you. But you must wake.
L110080	u641	m40	WALLACE	I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
L110079	u636	m40	MARION	Yes, you are. And you must wake.
L110078	u641	m40	WALLACE	I'm dreaming.
L110122	u638	m40	PRINCESS	...I wouldn't know.
L110121	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
L110120	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
L110119	u638	m40	PRINCESS	This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
L110118	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
L110117	u638	m40	PRINCESS	He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
L110116	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
L110115	u638	m40	PRINCESS	How do you know this?
L110114	u637	m40	NICOLETTE	When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
L110465	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
L110464	u641	m40	WALLACE	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
L110463	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Drink this! It will dull your pain.
L110462	u641	m40	WALLACE	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
L110461	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You will die! It will be awful!
L110459	u641	m40	WALLACE	If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
L110458	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
L110457	u641	m40	WALLACE	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
L110456	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
L110455	u641	m40	WALLACE	M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
L110393	u638	m40	PRINCESS	No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
L110392	u641	m40	WALLACE	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
L110391	u638	m40	PRINCESS	You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
L110390	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
L110389	u641	m40	WALLACE	You have... you have a husband.
L110386	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
L110385	u641	m40	WALLACE	Why did you?
L110380	u638	m40	PRINCESS	It does me good to see you.
L110379	u641	m40	WALLACE	A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
L110274	u641	m40	WALLACE	She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
L110273	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
L110272	u641	m40	WALLACE	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
L110271	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Peace is made is such ways.
L110270	u641	m40	WALLACE	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
L110269	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
L110260	u638	m40	PRINCESS	That is not possible.
L110259	u641	m40	WALLACE	York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
L110258	u638	m40	PRINCESS	Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
L110257	u641	m40	WALLACE	I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
L110256	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
L110255	u638	m40	PRINCESS	But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
L110254	u641	m40	WALLACE	It's battle I want, not talk.
L110253	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
L110252	u641	m40	WALLACE	Wife of Edward, the king's son?
L110251	u638	m40	PRINCESS	I am the Princess of Wales.
L110309	u641	m40	WALLACE	And I will consult with mine.
L110308	u639	m40	ROBERT	I must... consult with my father.
L110307	u641	m40	WALLACE	Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
L110306	u639	m40	ROBERT	I am trying.
L110305	u641	m40	WALLACE	War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
L110220	u641	m40	WALLACE	Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
L110219	u639	m40	ROBERT	I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
L110218	u641	m40	WALLACE	We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
L110217	u639	m40	ROBERT	No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
L110216	u641	m40	WALLACE	And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
L110215	u639	m40	ROBERT	Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
L110400	u641	m40	WALLACE	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
L110399	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Come, it'll help you sleep.
L110156	u641	m40	WALLACE	Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
L110155	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Fine speech. Now what do we do?
L110107	u641	m40	WALLACE	No English lord would trust an Irishman!
L110106	u640	m40	STEPHEN	I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
L110099	u641	m40	WALLACE	Exactly.
L110098	u640	m40	STEPHEN	Who would do such a thing?
L110097	u641	m40	WALLACE	The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
L110096	u640	m40	STEPHEN	What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
L110095	u641	m40	WALLACE	They've tricked us.
L110094	u640	m40	STEPHEN	We can't stop!
L180382	u832	m53	MERRICK	If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
L180381	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
L180380	u832	m53	MERRICK	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
L180379	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
L180375	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, yes.
L180374	u824	m53	ANNE	I've always thought that myself.
L180373	u832	m53	MERRICK	They have noble faces.
L180370	u832	m53	MERRICK	How lovely.
L180369	u824	m53	ANNE	And here is one of Frederick's mother.
L180352	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh?
L180351	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
L180348	u832	m53	MERRICK	Two, please.
L180347	u824	m53	ANNE	One or two?
L180346	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes please, two.
L180345	u824	m53	ANNE	Mr. Merrick, sugar?
L180508	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh Frederick.
L180507	u838	m53	TREVES	...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
L180506	u824	m53	ANNE	Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
L180505	u838	m53	TREVES	But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
L180504	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
L180503	u838	m53	TREVES	That I am very little different from him.
L180502	u824	m53	ANNE	Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
L180501	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
L180500	u824	m53	ANNE	...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
L180499	u838	m53	TREVES	Hmmm?
L180498	u824	m53	ANNE	More romances for John?
L180497	u824	m53	ANNE	Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
L180496	u838	m53	TREVES	You stay with me.
L180372	u824	m53	ANNE	And here are my mother and father.
L180371	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180350	u824	m53	ANNE	Do you?
L180349	u838	m53	TREVES	John loves the house.
L180168	u838	m53	TREVES	I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
L180167	u824	m53	ANNE	Well, these things take time.
L180166	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
L180165	u824	m53	ANNE	I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
L180164	u838	m53	TREVES	And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
L180163	u824	m53	ANNE	Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
L180162	u838	m53	TREVES	I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
L180161	u824	m53	ANNE	Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
L180160	u838	m53	TREVES	He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
L180159	u824	m53	ANNE	But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
L180158	u838	m53	TREVES	Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
L180157	u824	m53	ANNE	What do you mean?
L180156	u838	m53	TREVES	I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
L180155	u824	m53	ANNE	Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
L179960	u838	m53	TREVES	No, I think a whiskey.
L179959	u824	m53	ANNE	Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
L179958	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
L179957	u824	m53	ANNE	Did it go well, darling?
L179847	u838	m53	TREVES	I'll join you shortly.
L179846	u824	m53	ANNE	You won't be long?
L179972	u838	m53	TREVES	I'll get my bag.
L179971	u825	m53	BOY	Like this. 
L179970	u838	m53	TREVES	What is it?
L179969	u825	m53	BOY	Our man is sick. Come right away.
L179889	u838	m53	TREVES	Did you see it?
L179888	u825	m53	BOY	I found it.
L179887	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes?
L179886	u825	m53	BOY	Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
L180635	u826	m53	BYTES	Shut up!
L180634	u825	m53	BOY	Don't!
L180633	u826	m53	BYTES	I'll show you! I'll show you!
L180632	u825	m53	BOY	What are you going to do?
L180631	u826	m53	BYTES	If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
L180630	u825	m53	BOY	He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
L180629	u826	m53	BYTES	He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
L180628	u825	m53	BOY	Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
L180627	u826	m53	BYTES	You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
L180145	u826	m53	BYTES	Right... Right.
L180144	u838	m53	TREVES	Now I think we really do understand one another.
L180141	u826	m53	BYTES	I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
L180140	u838	m53	TREVES	So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
L180139	u826	m53	BYTES	I want him back!
L180138	u838	m53	TREVES	You don't own this man!
L180137	u826	m53	BYTES	You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
L180136	u838	m53	TREVES	All you do is profit from another man's misery!
L180135	u826	m53	BYTES	He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
L180134	u838	m53	TREVES	I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
L180133	u826	m53	BYTES	Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
L180132	u838	m53	TREVES	You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
L180131	u826	m53	BYTES	DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
L180130	u838	m53	TREVES	He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
L180129	u826	m53	BYTES	Never mind that, I want my man!
L180128	u838	m53	TREVES	Just a moment, how did you get in here?
L180127	u826	m53	BYTES	I want my man back.
L179988	u838	m53	TREVES	Everything will be seen to.
L179987	u826	m53	BYTES	I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
L179985	u838	m53	TREVES	"You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his ""fall"". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab."
L179984	u826	m53	BYTES	Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
L179983	u838	m53	TREVES	This man belongs in hospital.
L179982	u826	m53	BYTES	That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
L179981	u838	m53	TREVES	Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
L179980	u826	m53	BYTES	He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
L179979	u838	m53	TREVES	He must have taken quite a fall.
L179978	u826	m53	BYTES	He fell.  He falls.
L179977	u838	m53	TREVES	What happened?
L179976	u838	m53	TREVES	I intend to.
L179975	u826	m53	BYTES	He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
L179974	u838	m53	TREVES	What do you mean?
L179973	u826	m53	BYTES	What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
L180516	u827	m53	CARR	Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
L180515	u838	m53	TREVES	Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
L180318	u838	m53	TREVES	Please do.
L180317	u827	m53	CARR	Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
L180316	u838	m53	TREVES	But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
L180315	u827	m53	CARR	Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
L180314	u838	m53	TREVES	Has the response picked up?
L180256	u827	m53	CARR	Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
L180255	u838	m53	TREVES	No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
L180254	u827	m53	CARR	Don't we?
L180242	u827	m53	CARR	Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
L180241	u838	m53	TREVES	Do you think they'll go along with us?
L180240	u827	m53	CARR	Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
L180239	u838	m53	TREVES	Well, yes.
L180238	u827	m53	CARR	No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
L180237	u838	m53	TREVES	I could easily arrange...
L180236	u827	m53	CARR	You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
L180235	u827	m53	CARR	No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
L180234	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I think I can.
L180233	u827	m53	CARR	Can you imagine what his life has been like?
L180227	u838	m53	TREVES	Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
L180226	u827	m53	CARR	Treves. Well done.
L180218	u838	m53	TREVES	Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
L180217	u827	m53	CARR	I don't understand.
L180216	u838	m53	TREVES	How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
L180210	u827	m53	CARR	I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
L180209	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
L180208	u827	m53	CARR	It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
L180193	u838	m53	TREVES	And what was that, John?
L180192	u827	m53	CARR	Oh yes?
L180179	u827	m53	CARR	Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
L180178	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
L180177	u827	m53	CARR	He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
L180176	u838	m53	TREVES	...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
L180175	u827	m53	CARR	Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
L180174	u838	m53	TREVES	It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
L180151	u838	m53	TREVES	...Yes, Sir.
L180150	u827	m53	CARR	Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
L180149	u838	m53	TREVES	Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
L180148	u827	m53	CARR	Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
L180147	u838	m53	TREVES	Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
L180146	u827	m53	CARR	Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
L180126	u827	m53	CARR	Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
L180125	u838	m53	TREVES	Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
L180124	u827	m53	CARR	"No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."
L180123	u838	m53	TREVES	I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
L180122	u827	m53	CARR	I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
L180121	u838	m53	TREVES	Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
L180120	u827	m53	CARR	A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
L180119	u838	m53	TREVES	He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
L180118	u827	m53	CARR	Good! How is the patient?
L180117	u838	m53	TREVES	Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
L180116	u827	m53	CARR	Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
L180016	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
L180015	u827	m53	CARR	I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
L180014	u838	m53	TREVES	No, more of an acquaintance.
L180013	u827	m53	CARR	Oh, is he a friend of yours?
L180012	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
L180011	u827	m53	CARR	What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
L180010	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes sir.
L180009	u827	m53	CARR	Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
L180008	u838	m53	TREVES	Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
L180007	u827	m53	CARR	Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
L180006	u838	m53	TREVES	No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
L180005	u827	m53	CARR	A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
L180004	u827	m53	CARR	Indeed!
L180003	u838	m53	TREVES	Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
L180000	u827	m53	CARR	Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
L179999	u838	m53	TREVES	It's quite nutritious, sir.
L179998	u827	m53	CARR	You've acquired a taste for this?
L179997	u838	m53	TREVES	Good morning, sir.
L179996	u827	m53	CARR	Good morning, Treves.
L180222	u827	m53	CARR	I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
L180221	u832	m53	MERRICK	I am very pleased to meet you.
L180220	u827	m53	CARR	It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
L180213	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
L180212	u827	m53	CARR	What is it, Treves?
L180205	u827	m53	CARR	Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
L180204	u832	m53	MERRICK	...everyone has been very kind.
L180203	u827	m53	CARR	Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
L180202	u832	m53	MERRICK	...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
L180189	u832	m53	MERRICK	Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
L180188	u827	m53	CARR	Are you comfortable here?
L180187	u832	m53	MERRICK	I feel much better. Thank you.
L180186	u827	m53	CARR	I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
L180185	u832	m53	MERRICK	I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
L180184	u827	m53	CARR	How are you feeling today?
L179952	u838	m53	TREVES	He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
L179951	u828	m53	FOX	You never mentioned his mental state.
L179934	u828	m53	FOX	Nothing of any importance, eh?
L179933	u838	m53	TREVES	I don't know what I've got.
L179932	u828	m53	FOX	Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
L179931	u838	m53	TREVES	You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
L179930	u828	m53	FOX	Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
L179892	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
L179891	u828	m53	FOX	I say Freddie, what are you about?
L179878	u828	m53	FOX	What a mess.
L179877	u838	m53	TREVES	Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
L179876	u838	m53	TREVES	Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
L179875	u828	m53	FOX	Three quarters of an hour.
L179874	u838	m53	TREVES	How long has this man been here?
L180711	u829	m53	K. HEN	"I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say ""I love you"". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly."
L180710	u830	m53	KATH	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
L180709	u829	m53	K. HEN	What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
L180708	u830	m53	KATH	O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
L180707	u829	m53	K. HEN	An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
L180706	u830	m53	KATH	"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."
L180705	u829	m53	K. HEN	O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
L180704	u830	m53	KATH	Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
L180703	u829	m53	K. HEN	Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
L180436	u831	m53	KENDAL	Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
L180435	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no?
L180434	u831	m53	KENDAL	Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
L180433	u832	m53	MERRICK	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
L180432	u831	m53	KENDAL	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
L180431	u832	m53	MERRICK	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
L180428	u832	m53	MERRICK	No, but I certainly shall.
L180427	u831	m53	KENDAL	Have you read it?
L180426	u831	m53	KENDAL	That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
L180425	u832	m53	MERRICK	Romance!
L180424	u831	m53	KENDAL	It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
L180423	u832	m53	MERRICK	Tell me about it, please!
L180422	u831	m53	KENDAL	Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
L180421	u832	m53	MERRICK	Alas, no.
L180420	u831	m53	KENDAL	You've never been?
L180419	u832	m53	MERRICK	Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
L180418	u831	m53	KENDAL	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
L180417	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
L180416	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180415	u831	m53	KENDAL	She's very pretty, your mother.
L180414	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
L180413	u831	m53	KENDAL	I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
L180412	u831	m53	KENDAL	I knew you'd understand. Here.
L180411	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, no.
L180410	u831	m53	KENDAL	I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
L180409	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good day...!
L180699	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180698	u831	m53	KENDAL	Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
L180697	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
L180696	u831	m53	KENDAL	Is he... dying then?
L180695	u838	m53	TREVES	And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
L180694	u831	m53	KENDAL	How awful for John.
L180693	u838	m53	TREVES	I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
L180692	u831	m53	KENDAL	Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
L180691	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
L180690	u831	m53	KENDAL	It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
L180408	u831	m53	KENDAL	Good day, Mr. Merrick.
L180407	u838	m53	TREVES	John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
L180661	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
L180660	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, yes.
L180659	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
L180658	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no, my friend...
L180657	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
L180646	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Won't be a moment.
L180645	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180644	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Of course! You want out?
L180643	u832	m53	MERRICK	You're English.
L180642	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	Want to come out?
L180641	u832	m53	MERRICK	y-y-yes--
L180640	u837	m53	PLUMED DWARF	You alright?
L180402	u835	m53	NORA	Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
L180401	u832	m53	MERRICK	I'll have to find some more.
L180399	u832	m53	MERRICK	...I learned a long time ago.
L180398	u835	m53	NORA	The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
L180397	u832	m53	MERRICK	The main spire.
L180396	u835	m53	NORA	What's this?
L180395	u835	m53	NORA	It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
L180394	u832	m53	MERRICK	I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
L180393	u835	m53	NORA	The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
L180392	u835	m53	NORA	Where did you get this box?
L180391	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thank you... very much.
L180390	u835	m53	NORA	But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
L180389	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180388	u835	m53	NORA	What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
L180385	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good morning.
L180384	u835	m53	NORA	Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
L180329	u832	m53	MERRICK	No, nothing.
L180328	u835	m53	NORA	Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
L180327	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thank you very much.
L180325	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180324	u835	m53	NORA	Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
L180732	u832	m53	MERRICK	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
L180731	u838	m53	TREVES	Goodnight John. Sleep well.
L180729	u838	m53	TREVES	No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
L180728	u832	m53	MERRICK	Then I shouldn't change anything?
L180727	u838	m53	TREVES	No, John, not one that I can see.
L180726	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
L180725	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes John?
L180723	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
L180722	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh yes! It was wonderful!
L180721	u838	m53	TREVES	Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
L180720	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes, very soon.
L180719	u838	m53	TREVES	Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
L180716	u838	m53	TREVES	It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
L180715	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no, I couldn't.
L180714	u838	m53	TREVES	Stand up, John. Let them see you.
L180689	u838	m53	TREVES	John.... how can you ever forgive me?
L180688	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves! Treves.
L180551	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
L180550	u838	m53	TREVES	Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
L180549	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
L180548	u838	m53	TREVES	Is it the one you wanted?
L180547	u838	m53	TREVES	There is one more thing, John. Here.
L180546	u832	m53	MERRICK	My home.
L180545	u832	m53	MERRICK	Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
L180544	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180543	u832	m53	MERRICK	You did this for me?
L180542	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, John.
L180541	u832	m53	MERRICK	...my... home?
L180483	u832	m53	MERRICK	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
L180482	u838	m53	TREVES	You want a dressing bag, John?
L180481	u838	m53	TREVES	Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
L180480	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
L180479	u838	m53	TREVES	How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
L180478	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
L180477	u838	m53	TREVES	The cathedral is coming along nicely.
L180471	u832	m53	MERRICK	I thought as much.
L180470	u838	m53	TREVES	No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
L180469	u832	m53	MERRICK	...Can you cure me?
L180468	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes, John?
L180467	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
L180466	u838	m53	TREVES	Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
L180465	u832	m53	MERRICK	When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
L180406	u838	m53	TREVES	John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
L180405	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good morning.
L180404	u838	m53	TREVES	Good morning, John.
L180378	u832	m53	MERRICK	Here.
L180377	u838	m53	TREVES	Your mother?
L180376	u832	m53	MERRICK	Would you... would you like to see my mother?
L180368	u832	m53	MERRICK	Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
L180367	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
L180366	u832	m53	MERRICK	The Children. Where are your children
L180365	u838	m53	TREVES	Of course.
L180364	u832	m53	MERRICK	The children! May I see?
L180363	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh, our relatives... the children.
L180362	u832	m53	MERRICK	Who are they of?
L180361	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh yes.
L180360	u832	m53	MERRICK	I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
L180359	u838	m53	TREVES	Not at all, John.
L180358	u832	m53	MERRICK	It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
L180357	u838	m53	TREVES	How is your tea, John?
L180356	u832	m53	MERRICK	Ohhh...
L180355	u838	m53	TREVES	That's a canopy, John.
L180354	u832	m53	MERRICK	Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
L180339	u832	m53	MERRICK	I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
L180338	u838	m53	TREVES	John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
L180332	u838	m53	TREVES	When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
L180331	u832	m53	MERRICK	Thank you very much.
L180330	u838	m53	TREVES	You look splendid, John.
L180312	u838	m53	TREVES	I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
L180311	u832	m53	MERRICK	How long will I stay here?
L180310	u838	m53	TREVES	Of course! What did you think?
L180309	u832	m53	MERRICK	The hospital?
L180308	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes.
L180307	u832	m53	MERRICK	This... is my new home?
L180297	u838	m53	TREVES	Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
L180296	u832	m53	MERRICK	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
L180295	u838	m53	TREVES	Good evening. How are you feeling?
L180232	u838	m53	TREVES	We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
L180231	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
L180230	u838	m53	TREVES	I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
L180229	u832	m53	MERRICK	You did not ask me.
L180228	u838	m53	TREVES	Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
L180196	u832	m53	MERRICK	But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
L180195	u838	m53	TREVES	...Yes potatoes... but...
L180191	u832	m53	MERRICK	Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
L180190	u838	m53	TREVES	Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
L180182	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
L180181	u838	m53	TREVES	John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
L180173	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
L180172	u838	m53	TREVES	"Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say ""May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm."" And you will say..."
L180171	u832	m53	MERRICK	Righteousness for his namesake.
L180170	u838	m53	TREVES	Righteousness...
L180169	u832	m53	MERRICK	The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
L180109	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello, my name is John Merrick.
L180108	u838	m53	TREVES	Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
L180104	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
L180103	u838	m53	TREVES	Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
L180102	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mmmerrick.
L180101	u838	m53	TREVES	"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
L180100	u832	m53	MERRICK	Mmmerrick.
L180099	u838	m53	TREVES	"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
L180098	u832	m53	MERRICK	Merrick...
L180097	u838	m53	TREVES	"Say ""Merrick""."
L180096	u832	m53	MERRICK	John... Merrick
L180095	u838	m53	TREVES	John Merrick.
L180094	u832	m53	MERRICK	My... name is...
L180093	u838	m53	TREVES	My name is...
L180092	u832	m53	MERRICK	Hello...
L180091	u838	m53	TREVES	"Excellent! Now, say... ""Hello"""
L180090	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes.
L180089	u838	m53	TREVES	Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
L180088	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yes!
L180087	u838	m53	TREVES	"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."
L180086	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yyess.
L180085	u838	m53	TREVES	Yyyess.
L180084	u832	m53	MERRICK	...Yyes
L180083	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes John!
L180082	u832	m53	MERRICK	Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
L180540	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Welcome home, John.
L180539	u838	m53	TREVES	So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
L180493	u838	m53	TREVES	John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
L180492	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Well...
L180491	u838	m53	TREVES	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
L180490	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	A dressing bag?
L180489	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes. John wants it.
L180488	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Very smart indeed.
L180487	u838	m53	TREVES	A dressing bag.
L180486	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Yes sir.  What's that?
L180485	u838	m53	TREVES	Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
L180484	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
L180463	u838	m53	TREVES	You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
L180462	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
L180461	u838	m53	TREVES	Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
L180460	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
L180459	u838	m53	TREVES	Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
L180458	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
L180457	u838	m53	TREVES	Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
L180456	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
L180455	u838	m53	TREVES	Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
L180453	u838	m53	TREVES	I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
L180452	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Watery headed bunch.
L180113	u838	m53	TREVES	I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
L180112	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
L180111	u838	m53	TREVES	We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
L180110	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
L180076	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
L180075	u838	m53	TREVES	"He's had his share of ""smacks"", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man."
L180071	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
L180070	u838	m53	TREVES	No, he's very upset about something.
L180069	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Won't come out, eh?
L180068	u838	m53	TREVES	Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
L180067	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
L180041	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes! The workhouse!
L180040	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	The workhouse.
L180033	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes... Yes, let's go in.
L180032	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
L180031	u838	m53	TREVES	Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
L180030	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	I've heard.
L180029	u838	m53	TREVES	Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
L180028	u833	m53	MOTHERSHEAD	Fine.
L180027	u838	m53	TREVES	Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
L180601	u838	m53	TREVES	YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
L180600	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
L180599	u838	m53	TREVES	YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
L180598	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
L180597	u838	m53	TREVES	HE'S GONE!
L180596	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
L180595	u838	m53	TREVES	Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
L180594	u834	m53	NIGHT PORTER	I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
L180593	u838	m53	TREVES	WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
L179912	u838	m53	TREVES	I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
L179911	u836	m53	OWNER	Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
L179910	u838	m53	TREVES	So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
L179904	u836	m53	OWNER	Never mind. I'm the owner.
L179903	u838	m53	TREVES	Pardon me?
L179902	u836	m53	OWNER	Handsomely?... Who sent you?
L179901	u838	m53	TREVES	I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
L179900	u836	m53	OWNER	I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
L179899	u838	m53	TREVES	Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
L179898	u836	m53	OWNER	And who might you be, sir?
L179897	u838	m53	TREVES	Are you the proprietor?
L328490	u1555	m104	AL	I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
L328489	u1568	m104	JIM	Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
L328460	u1555	m104	AL	Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc...
L328459	u1568	m104	JIM	William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
L328435	u1555	m104	AL	Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
L328434	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
L328433	u1555	m104	AL	"The U.S. Attorney in Washington ""declines"" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named."
L328316	u1568	m104	JIM	Not one word.  That's an order.
L328315	u1555	m104	AL	When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
L328314	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
L328228	u1555	m104	AL	My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
L328227	u1568	m104	JIM	Susie, watch the language, would you please.
L327970	u1568	m104	JIM	The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
L327969	u1555	m104	AL	If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
L327839	u1568	m104	JIM	Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
L327838	u1555	m104	AL	Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
L327895	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
L327894	u1568	m104	JIM	Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
L327893	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	There were no phone records.
L327892	u1568	m104	JIM	Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
L327891	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
L327890	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
L327889	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
L327888	u1568	m104	JIM	Recall any names?
L327887	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
L327886	u1568	m104	JIM	So you saw Oswald how many times?
L327885	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
L327884	u1568	m104	JIM	And Oswald?
L327883	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
L327882	u1568	m104	JIM	Did he pay?
L327881	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
L327880	u1568	m104	JIM	What was his voice like?
L327874	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
L327873	u1568	m104	JIM	Street cats?
L327872	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
L327871	u1568	m104	JIM	When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
L327870	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
L327869	u1568	m104	JIM	Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
L327867	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
L327866	u1568	m104	JIM	Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
L327865	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Right.
L327864	u1568	m104	JIM	"You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this ""Clay Bertrand"" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer."
L327863	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
L327862	u1568	m104	JIM	Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
L327861	u1556	m104	ANDREWS	Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
L327533	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
L327532	u1557	m104	BANISTER	I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
L327531	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
L327530	u1557	m104	BANISTER	You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
L327529	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
L327528	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
L327527	u1557	m104	BANISTER	I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
L327526	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
L327525	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
L327524	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
L327523	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
L327522	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
L327513	u1557	m104	BANISTER	Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
L327512	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
L327511	u1557	m104	BANISTER	A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
L327510	u1577	m104	MARTIN	God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
L327509	u1557	m104	BANISTER	All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
L328472	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
L328471	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
L327998	u1586	m104	SUSIE	No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
L327997	u1558	m104	BILL	Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
L327996	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Who?
L327796	u1586	m104	SUSIE	You want facts, Bill?  Okay.  From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia.  From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald.  All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
L327795	u1558	m104	BILL	Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
L327794	u1586	m104	SUSIE	I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
L327784	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
L327783	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
L328283	u1563	m104	FRANK	Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
L328282	u1558	m104	BILL	No, I'm not...
L328281	u1563	m104	FRANK	Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
L328280	u1563	m104	FRANK	Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
L328279	u1558	m104	BILL	Frank, I don't want to hear it.
L328278	u1563	m104	FRANK	You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
L328277	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah, I guess you do.
L328276	u1563	m104	FRANK	Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
L328275	u1558	m104	BILL	Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
L328274	u1563	m104	FRANK	It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
L328273	u1558	m104	BILL	Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
L328272	u1563	m104	FRANK	Bill.
L328447	u1574	m104	LOU	You're not digging.
L328446	u1558	m104	BILL	Keep saying what?
L328445	u1574	m104	LOU	You know you keep saying that.
L328444	u1558	m104	BILL	...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
L328443	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
L328266	u1558	m104	BILL	With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
L328265	u1574	m104	LOU	Not unless we go for Shaw now.
L328264	u1558	m104	BILL	The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
L328248	u1574	m104	LOU	Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
L328247	u1558	m104	BILL	"It's addressed to no one and no signature.  ""To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."""
L327842	u1558	m104	BILL	You, Numa?
L327841	u1574	m104	LOU	I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
L327840	u1558	m104	BILL	What do you think, Lou?
L327612	u1558	m104	BILL	Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
L327611	u1574	m104	LOU	Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
L327987	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
L327986	u1558	m104	BILL	So why does he call himself Bertrand?
L327985	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
L327984	u1558	m104	BILL	Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
L327983	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
L327982	u1558	m104	BILL	What's the other name?
L327981	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
L327980	u1558	m104	BILL	Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
L327979	u1580	m104	MOBSTER	Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
L327925	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	"...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know ""beatnik"" type things."
L327924	u1558	m104	BILL	Go on, Willie.
L327923	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
L327916	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
L327915	u1558	m104	BILL	And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
L327914	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
L327911	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
L327910	u1558	m104	BILL	Did he pay you for this?
L327907	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
L327906	u1558	m104	BILL	Clay Bertrand, Willie?
L328484	u1558	m104	BILL	This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
L328483	u1568	m104	JIM	"Julius Caesar:  ""Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men.""  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA..."
L328482	u1558	m104	BILL	Yeah.
L328481	u1568	m104	JIM	With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
L328480	u1558	m104	BILL	Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
L328479	u1568	m104	JIM	If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
L328478	u1558	m104	BILL	Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
L328477	u1568	m104	JIM	I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
L328476	u1558	m104	BILL	Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
L328475	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
L328474	u1558	m104	BILL	So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
L328473	u1568	m104	JIM	Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
L328470	u1568	m104	JIM	There's a word - orders.
L328469	u1558	m104	BILL	I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
L328271	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
L328270	u1558	m104	BILL	Where you going, boss?
L328269	u1568	m104	JIM	All right, all right.  Break it up.
L328257	u1568	m104	JIM	Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
L328256	u1558	m104	BILL	"Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  ""When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."""
L328224	u1558	m104	BILL	Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
L328223	u1568	m104	JIM	Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
L328187	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
L328186	u1558	m104	BILL	"That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a ""White Paper"" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss..."
L328002	u1568	m104	JIM	I think we should have him in for a little talk.
L328001	u1558	m104	BILL	That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
L328000	u1568	m104	JIM	Can you get some sworn statements?
L327837	u1568	m104	JIM	Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
L327836	u1558	m104	BILL	I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
L327833	u1568	m104	JIM	To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
L327832	u1558	m104	BILL	But why?
L327831	u1568	m104	JIM	"It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - ""a patsy"".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, ""O.H. Lee"" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?"
L327830	u1558	m104	BILL	He had his palm print on the weapon.
L327829	u1568	m104	JIM	I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
L327828	u1558	m104	BILL	And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
L327827	u1568	m104	JIM	We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
L327826	u1558	m104	BILL	I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
L327761	u1558	m104	BILL	Gee, thanks boss.
L327760	u1568	m104	JIM	The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
L327759	u1558	m104	BILL	And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
L327758	u1568	m104	JIM	When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
L327757	u1558	m104	BILL	He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
L327756	u1568	m104	JIM	Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
L327755	u1558	m104	BILL	Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
L327710	u1568	m104	JIM	No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
L327709	u1558	m104	BILL	Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
L327697	u1568	m104	JIM	Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
L327696	u1558	m104	BILL	What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
L327678	u1568	m104	JIM	Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
L327677	u1558	m104	BILL	At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
L327676	u1568	m104	JIM	Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
L327567	u1558	m104	BILL	The anonymous kind, Chief.
L327566	u1568	m104	JIM	Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
L328263	u1559	m104	CORONER	If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
L328262	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
L328261	u1559	m104	CORONER	Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
L328260	u1568	m104	JIM	Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
L328259	u1559	m104	CORONER	He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
L328258	u1568	m104	JIM	Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
L328246	u1559	m104	CORONER	I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
L328245	u1568	m104	JIM	What's it look like, Nick?
L328616	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
L328615	u1560	m104	DYMOND	I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
L328614	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
L328613	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Why?
L328612	u1565	m104	GOLDBERG	I did.
L328611	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
L328642	u1560	m104	DYMOND	Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
L328641	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328640	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
L328639	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
L328638	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
L328637	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.
L328636	u1560	m104	DYMOND	...ever called Dean Andrews?
L328635	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I did not.

A ""wanna be,"" y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me."
L328146	u1574	m104	LOU	What do you mean?
L328145	u1561	m104	FERRIE	That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
L328144	u1574	m104	LOU	Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
L328143	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
L328142	u1574	m104	LOU	"Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I""m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready."
L328134	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
L328133	u1574	m104	LOU	Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
L328132	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
L328122	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
L328121	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
L328120	u1561	m104	FERRIE	...give me protection?
L328119	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
L328118	u1561	m104	FERRIE	The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
L328117	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
L328116	u1561	m104	FERRIE	It leads farther than that.
L328115	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
L328114	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You still questioning any Cubans?
L328113	u1574	m104	LOU	What did they...
L328112	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
L328111	u1574	m104	LOU	What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
L328110	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
L328109	u1574	m104	LOU	Calm down, Dave, what?
L328108	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
L328107	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
L328106	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
L328105	u1574	m104	LOU	Dave?
L328104	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You know damn well who it is.
L328170	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
L328169	u1568	m104	JIM	Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
L328168	u1561	m104	FERRIE	They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
L328167	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
L328166	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
L328165	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
L328164	u1568	m104	JIM	Then who killed the President?
L328161	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
L328160	u1568	m104	JIM	What about Ruby?
L328159	u1561	m104	FERRIE	"Shaw's an ""untouchable"", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency."
L328158	u1568	m104	JIM	And Shaw?
L328157	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
L328156	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
L328155	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
L328154	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
L328153	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
L328152	u1568	m104	JIM	Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
L328149	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
L328148	u1568	m104	JIM	Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
L328140	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
L328139	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
L328138	u1561	m104	FERRIE	You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
L328137	u1568	m104	JIM	Who was paying you, Dave?
L328136	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
L328135	u1568	m104	JIM	You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
L327922	u1568	m104	JIM	"Would you say this ""Leon"" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?"
L327921	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
L327607	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
L327606	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Why?  What's wrong?
L327605	u1568	m104	JIM	I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
L327604	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
L327603	u1568	m104	JIM	Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
L327602	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
L327601	u1568	m104	JIM	But the boys told us they didn't get any.
L327600	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I believe the boys got a couple.
L327599	u1568	m104	JIM	Did you bag any geese on this trip?
L327598	u1561	m104	FERRIE	In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
L327597	u1568	m104	JIM	And then Sunday?
L327596	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
L327595	u1568	m104	JIM	Why Galveston?
L327594	u1561	m104	FERRIE	We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
L327593	u1568	m104	JIM	I see.  And where did you drive?
L327592	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
L327591	u1568	m104	JIM	Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
L327590	u1561	m104	FERRIE	I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
L327589	u1568	m104	JIM	What was so appealing about Houston?
L327588	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
L327587	u1568	m104	JIM	Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
L327586	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No, I never saw him before in my life.
L327585	u1568	m104	JIM	I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
L327584	u1561	m104	FERRIE	No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
L327583	u1568	m104	JIM	But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
L327582	u1561	m104	FERRIE	That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
L327581	u1568	m104	JIM	How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
L327580	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
L327579	u1568	m104	JIM	How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
L327578	u1561	m104	FERRIE	Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
L327577	u1568	m104	JIM	Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
L328676	u1562	m104	FINCK	Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
L328675	u1568	m104	JIM	There were admirals.
L328674	u1562	m104	FINCK	No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
L328673	u1568	m104	JIM	But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
L328672	u1562	m104	FINCK	No.
L328671	u1568	m104	JIM	But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
L328670	u1562	m104	FINCK	I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
L328667	u1562	m104	FINCK	Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
L328666	u1568	m104	JIM	Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
L328665	u1562	m104	FINCK	I had the cause of death.
L328664	u1568	m104	JIM	As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
L328663	u1562	m104	FINCK	I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
L328662	u1568	m104	JIM	Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
L328631	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
L328630	u1564	m104	GARRISON	I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
L328629	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
L328628	u1564	m104	GARRISON	That's our case!
L328627	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
L328626	u1564	m104	GARRISON	Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
L328622	u1564	m104	GARRISON	What?
L328621	u1570	m104	JUDGE HAGGERTY	I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
L328556	u1568	m104	JIM	There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
L328555	u1566	m104	JASPER	I'm scared.
L328551	u1568	m104	JIM	No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
L328550	u1566	m104	JASPER	Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
L328549	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
L328548	u1566	m104	JASPER	Are we going away, Daddy?
L328077	u1568	m104	JIM	Hi, Freckle Face.
L328076	u1566	m104	JASPER	Daddy!  Where have you been?
L327642	u1566	m104	JASPER	A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
L327641	u1568	m104	JIM	That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
L327640	u1566	m104	JASPER	Dad, look what I drew.
L327632	u1568	m104	JIM	Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
L327631	u1566	m104	JASPER	Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
L328398	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
L328397	u1571	m104	LAWYER	Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
L328396	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
L328395	u1571	m104	LAWYER	I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
L328394	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
L328393	u1571	m104	LAWYER	...you heard echoes.
L328392	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
L328391	u1571	m104	LAWYER	I want the truth.
L328390	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
L328389	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
L328388	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No, you don't!
L328387	u1571	m104	LAWYER	That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
L328386	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
L328385	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
L328384	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
L328383	u1576	m104	MAN	We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
L328382	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
L328381	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
L328380	u1576	m104	MAN	That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
L328379	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	Four to six.
L328378	u1576	m104	MAN	How many shots you say you heard?
L328377	u1567	m104	JEAN HILL	These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
L328578	u1568	m104	JIM	I know.
L328577	u1586	m104	SUSIE	I'm sorry.
L328499	u1568	m104	JIM	No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
L328498	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Aren't you being a little hard?
L328449	u1586	m104	SUSIE	This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
L328448	u1568	m104	JIM	I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
L328238	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
L328237	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't believe it!
L327989	u1568	m104	JIM	"Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word ""microdots"" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for..."
L327988	u1586	m104	SUSIE	"...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name ""Oswald"" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name ""Oswald"" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity."
L327821	u1568	m104	JIM	"I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying ""We both know who's responsible.""  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?"
L327820	u1586	m104	SUSIE	All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
L327819	u1568	m104	JIM	Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
L327818	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
L327808	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
L327807	u1568	m104	JIM	Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
L327806	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
L327805	u1568	m104	JIM	Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
L327804	u1586	m104	SUSIE	None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
L327803	u1568	m104	JIM	And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
L327802	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
L327801	u1568	m104	JIM	But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
L327800	u1586	m104	SUSIE	The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
L327799	u1568	m104	JIM	This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
L327798	u1586	m104	SUSIE	None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
L327797	u1568	m104	JIM	Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
L327791	u1586	m104	SUSIE	But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
L327790	u1568	m104	JIM	Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
L327789	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
L327782	u1586	m104	SUSIE	Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
L327781	u1568	m104	JIM	If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
L328072	u1585	m104	SHAW	Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
L328071	u1568	m104	JIM	I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
L328070	u1585	m104	SHAW	May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
L328069	u1568	m104	JIM	No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
L328068	u1585	m104	SHAW	And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
L328067	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
L328066	u1585	m104	SHAW	Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
L328065	u1568	m104	JIM	...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
L328064	u1585	m104	SHAW	Nonsense.  What next?
L328063	u1568	m104	JIM	It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
L328062	u1585	m104	SHAW	I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
L328061	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
L328060	u1585	m104	SHAW	Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
L328059	u1568	m104	JIM	Please answer the question.
L328058	u1585	m104	SHAW	You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
L328057	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
L328056	u1585	m104	SHAW	Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
L328055	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
L328048	u1585	m104	SHAW	One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
L328047	u1568	m104	JIM	No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
L328046	u1585	m104	SHAW	Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
L328045	u1568	m104	JIM	Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
L328044	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
L328043	u1568	m104	JIM	Let me show you his picture. 
L328040	u1568	m104	JIM	...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
L328039	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
L328038	u1568	m104	JIM	David Ferrie.
L328037	u1585	m104	SHAW	Who?
L328036	u1568	m104	JIM	...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
L328035	u1585	m104	SHAW	Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
L328034	u1568	m104	JIM	After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
L328033	u1585	m104	SHAW	"It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering ""Frankie!"" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?"
L328032	u1568	m104	JIM	I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
L328031	u1585	m104	SHAW	Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
L328030	u1568	m104	JIM	Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
L328028	u1568	m104	JIM	Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
L328027	u1585	m104	SHAW	No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
L328026	u1568	m104	JIM	A Willie O'Keefe?
L328025	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.
L328024	u1568	m104	JIM	A Perry Russo?
L328023	u1585	m104	SHAW	No.  Never heard of him.
L328022	u1568	m104	JIM	We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
L328021	u1585	m104	SHAW	I wouldn't imagine where.
L328020	u1568	m104	JIM	Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
L328019	u1585	m104	SHAW	I'm not sure I understand.
L328346	u1578	m104	MERCER	I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
L328345	u1568	m104	JIM	Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
L328344	u1578	m104	MERCER	"This says ""Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck.""  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all..."
L328343	u1578	m104	MERCER	That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
L328342	u1568	m104	JIM	But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
L328341	u1578	m104	MERCER	"That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, ""that was the man I saw in the truck."""
L328340	u1568	m104	JIM	You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
L328332	u1578	m104	MERCER	Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
L328331	u1568	m104	JIM	In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
L328598	u1572	m104	LIZ	Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
L328597	u1568	m104	JIM	He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
L328596	u1572	m104	LIZ	Huh?
L328595	u1568	m104	JIM	They killed him, honey.
L328591	u1572	m104	LIZ	I don't think so, Jim...
L328590	u1568	m104	JIM	I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
L328589	u1572	m104	LIZ	And if you're wrong?
L328546	u1572	m104	LIZ	You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
L328545	u1568	m104	JIM	"Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and ""I'm jes fine honey.""  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not ""fine"" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away."
L328544	u1572	m104	LIZ	Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
L328543	u1568	m104	JIM	That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
L328542	u1572	m104	LIZ	"I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid ""trial""! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?"
L328541	u1568	m104	JIM	Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
L328540	u1572	m104	LIZ	I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
L328539	u1568	m104	JIM	Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
L328538	u1572	m104	LIZ	Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
L328537	u1568	m104	JIM	I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
L328536	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
L328535	u1568	m104	JIM	I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
L328534	u1572	m104	LIZ	You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
L328533	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
L328532	u1572	m104	LIZ	I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
L328531	u1568	m104	JIM	Get a hold of yourself.
L328530	u1572	m104	LIZ	How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
L328529	u1568	m104	JIM	Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
L328528	u1572	m104	LIZ	Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
L328527	u1568	m104	JIM	Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
L328526	u1572	m104	LIZ	Your daughter's life was just threatened!
L328525	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
L328524	u1572	m104	LIZ	A man just called.  He asked her everything!
L328523	u1568	m104	JIM	What?
L328522	u1572	m104	LIZ	Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
L328131	u1572	m104	LIZ	Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
L328130	u1568	m104	JIM	Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
L328127	u1568	m104	JIM	Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
L328126	u1572	m104	LIZ	It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
L328125	u1568	m104	JIM	Did they live?
L328087	u1568	m104	JIM	It's going to get worse, honey.
L328086	u1572	m104	LIZ	That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
L328085	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
L328084	u1572	m104	LIZ	"I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, ""Where's Daddy?""  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!"
L328083	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
L328082	u1572	m104	LIZ	We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
L328081	u1568	m104	JIM	Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
L328080	u1572	m104	LIZ	My sympathies.
L328079	u1568	m104	JIM	Tough day.
L328078	u1572	m104	LIZ	Hi.
L328016	u1568	m104	JIM	Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
L328015	u1572	m104	LIZ	You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
L328014	u1568	m104	JIM	I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
L328013	u1572	m104	LIZ	Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
L328012	u1568	m104	JIM	Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
L328011	u1572	m104	LIZ	But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
L328010	u1568	m104	JIM	No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
L328007	u1568	m104	JIM	You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
L328006	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
L328004	u1568	m104	JIM	It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
L328003	u1572	m104	LIZ	Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
L327674	u1568	m104	JIM	Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
L327673	u1572	m104	LIZ	Honey, go back to sleep, please!
L327672	u1568	m104	JIM	Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
L327671	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
L327670	u1568	m104	JIM	"And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  ""He only had two more Russian words right than wrong.""  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess."
L327669	u1572	m104	LIZ	These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
L327668	u1568	m104	JIM	Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
L327667	u1572	m104	LIZ	I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
L327666	u1568	m104	JIM	It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
L327665	u1572	m104	LIZ	Honey, you all right? 
L327647	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
L327646	u1572	m104	LIZ	One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
L327639	u1572	m104	LIZ	Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
L327638	u1568	m104	JIM	I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
L327630	u1572	m104	LIZ	Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
L327629	u1568	m104	JIM	Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
L327628	u1572	m104	LIZ	Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
L327953	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
L327952	u1568	m104	JIM	No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
L327951	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
L327950	u1568	m104	JIM	You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
L327949	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
L327948	u1568	m104	JIM	Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
L327913	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
L327912	u1568	m104	JIM	Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
L327909	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Well... yeah.
L327908	u1568	m104	JIM	For sexual purposes?
L327905	u1582	m104	O'KEEFE	Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
L327904	u1568	m104	JIM	I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
L328497	u1574	m104	LOU	You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
L328496	u1568	m104	JIM	I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
L328495	u1574	m104	LOU	Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
L328494	u1568	m104	JIM	Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
L328493	u1574	m104	LOU	Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
L328492	u1568	m104	JIM	Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
L328491	u1574	m104	LOU	I just plain don't trust him anymore.
L328486	u1568	m104	JIM	We need him back.
L328485	u1574	m104	LOU	Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
L328431	u1574	m104	LOU	You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
L328430	u1568	m104	JIM	Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
L328429	u1574	m104	LOU	They're gonna love you, chief.
L328428	u1568	m104	JIM	Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
L328427	u1574	m104	LOU	Allen Dulles?
L328426	u1568	m104	JIM	His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
L328425	u1574	m104	LOU	The Warren Commission call him?
L328424	u1568	m104	JIM	"General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a ""traitor"".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw."
L328423	u1574	m104	LOU	Who?
L328422	u1568	m104	JIM	Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
L328421	u1574	m104	LOU	No.
L328420	u1568	m104	JIM	You know who the mayor was?
L328419	u1574	m104	LOU	"Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, ""and afterwards there's only the freeway,"" and went home."
L328418	u1568	m104	JIM	Who do you think changed the parade route?
L328415	u1574	m104	LOU	"One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... ""3-2-1...  green!""  Or else ""Abort!  Abort!"""
L328414	u1568	m104	JIM	How many men?
L328413	u1574	m104	LOU	When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
L328410	u1568	m104	JIM	Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
L328409	u1574	m104	LOU	That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
L328408	u1568	m104	JIM	The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
L328407	u1574	m104	LOU	It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
L328406	u1568	m104	JIM	Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
L328405	u1574	m104	LOU	The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
L328404	u1568	m104	JIM	Between six and seven seconds.
L328403	u1574	m104	LOU	Time?
L328252	u1574	m104	LOU	I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
L328251	u1568	m104	JIM	I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
L328231	u1574	m104	LOU	I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
L328230	u1568	m104	JIM	I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
L328229	u1574	m104	LOU	You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
L328090	u1574	m104	LOU	"And it ain't pretty  ...""the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966."
L328089	u1568	m104	JIM	Goddamn Sam!
L327992	u1568	m104	JIM	I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
L327991	u1574	m104	LOU	Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
L327835	u1568	m104	JIM	Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
L327834	u1574	m104	LOU	I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
L327779	u1574	m104	LOU	Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
L327778	u1568	m104	JIM	Can we find her?
L327777	u1574	m104	LOU	There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
L327776	u1568	m104	JIM	We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
L327775	u1574	m104	LOU	Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
L327773	u1574	m104	LOU	...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
L327772	u1568	m104	JIM	Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
L327771	u1574	m104	LOU	...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
L327770	u1574	m104	LOU	A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
L327769	u1568	m104	JIM	I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
L327768	u1574	m104	LOU	They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
L327708	u1568	m104	JIM	We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
L327707	u1574	m104	LOU	What are you driving at, boss?
L327706	u1568	m104	JIM	Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
L327704	u1574	m104	LOU	Once ONI, always ONI?
L327703	u1568	m104	JIM	Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
L327702	u1574	m104	LOU	Post Office.
L327701	u1568	m104	JIM	Take a look across the street.
L327700	u1574	m104	LOU	The Office of Naval Intelligence.
L327699	u1568	m104	JIM	Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
L327698	u1574	m104	LOU	I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
L327680	u1574	m104	LOU	Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
L327679	u1568	m104	JIM	Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
L327560	u1574	m104	LOU	He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
L327559	u1568	m104	JIM	I know David - a strange character.
L327521	u1568	m104	JIM	Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
L327520	u1574	m104	LOU	One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
L327494	u1574	m104	LOU	No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
L327493	u1568	m104	JIM	Oh no!... How bad?
L327492	u1574	m104	LOU	Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
L327491	u1568	m104	JIM	What's wrong, Lou?
L327627	u1573	m104	LONG	Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
L327626	u1568	m104	JIM	Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
L327625	u1573	m104	LONG	Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
L327624	u1568	m104	JIM	You think there were other men involved, Russell?
L327623	u1573	m104	LONG	"If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  ""I'm just a patsy.""  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me."
L327622	u1568	m104	JIM	You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
L327621	u1573	m104	LONG	"Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One ""pristine"" bullet?  That dog don't hunt."
L327620	u1568	m104	JIM	I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
L327618	u1573	m104	LONG	Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
L327617	u1568	m104	JIM	I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
L327616	u1573	m104	LONG	"Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? ""Love Child.""  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House."
L328572	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	No, it can't!
L328571	u1568	m104	JIM	Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
L328570	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Pictures like this don't show up on television!
L328568	u1568	m104	JIM	That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
L328567	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Are they?  Why would they?
L328566	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
L328565	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Some people would say you're paranoid.
L328564	u1568	m104	JIM	Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
L328563	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
L328560	u1568	m104	JIM	I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
L328559	u1569	m104	JOHNSON	Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
L328786	u1588	m104	X	I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
L328785	u1568	m104	JIM	Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
L328784	u1588	m104	X	It never did. 
L328783	u1568	m104	JIM	...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
L328782	u1588	m104	X	"I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say ""protection"" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of ""okay"" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again."
L328781	u1588	m104	X	Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
L328780	u1568	m104	JIM	His name?
L328779	u1588	m104	X	You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
L328778	u1568	m104	JIM	Ever ask him?
L328777	u1588	m104	X	...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
L328776	u1568	m104	JIM	...and your General?
L328775	u1588	m104	X	...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
L328774	u1568	m104	JIM	Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
L328773	u1588	m104	X	He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
L328755	u1588	m104	X	I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
L328754	u1568	m104	JIM	Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
L328753	u1588	m104	X	You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
L328752	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, thanks for coming.
L328309	u1588	m104	X	But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
L328308	u1568	m104	JIM	I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
L328307	u1588	m104	X	No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
L328306	u1568	m104	JIM	The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
L328305	u1588	m104	X	Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
L328304	u1568	m104	JIM	I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
L328290	u1588	m104	X	I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
L328289	u1568	m104	JIM	I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
L328288	u1588	m104	X	I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
L328287	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
L328286	u1588	m104	X	I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
L328285	u1568	m104	JIM	Yes.
L328284	u1588	m104	X	Jim Garrison?
L327754	u1577	m104	MARTIN	You're so naive, mister.
L327753	u1568	m104	JIM	Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
L327752	u1577	m104	MARTIN	What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
L327751	u1568	m104	JIM	Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
L327750	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
L327749	u1568	m104	JIM	The assassination, Jack?
L327748	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
L327747	u1568	m104	JIM	Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
L327746	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
L327745	u1568	m104	JIM	Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
L327744	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
L327742	u1577	m104	MARTIN	There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
L327741	u1568	m104	JIM	Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
L327737	u1568	m104	JIM	Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
L327736	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
L327735	u1568	m104	JIM	And Oswald?
L327734	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
L327732	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
L327731	u1568	m104	JIM	Where is Banister in all this?
L327728	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
L327727	u1568	m104	JIM	Was he there often?
L327726	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
L327725	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
L327724	u1568	m104	JIM	Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
L327723	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
L327722	u1568	m104	JIM	You have other information?
L327721	u1577	m104	MARTIN	If you buy what you read in the paper.
L327720	u1568	m104	JIM	Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
L327719	u1577	m104	MARTIN	I don't know if I should talk about this.
L327718	u1568	m104	JIM	How much more?
L327716	u1568	m104	JIM	Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
L327715	u1577	m104	MARTIN	Never touched me.
L327714	u1568	m104	JIM	And he never hit you before?
L327713	u1577	m104	MARTIN	More than ten years.
L327712	u1568	m104	JIM	Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
L328588	u1568	m104	JIM	It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
L328587	u1581	m104	NUMA	Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
L328586	u1568	m104	JIM	"I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, ""The Old Man and the Sea""?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton."
L328584	u1568	m104	JIM	He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
L328583	u1581	m104	NUMA	Sure sounds like he's winning.
L328442	u1568	m104	JIM	I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
L328441	u1581	m104	NUMA	Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
L328440	u1568	m104	JIM	I just don't want to do it.  What else?
L328439	u1581	m104	NUMA	She's the best damn witness we have!
L328438	u1568	m104	JIM	No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
L328241	u1568	m104	JIM	Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
L328240	u1581	m104	NUMA	Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
L328233	u1568	m104	JIM	You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
L328232	u1581	m104	NUMA	HOLD IT, CHIEF...
L327994	u1568	m104	JIM	Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
L327993	u1581	m104	NUMA	Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
L327793	u1568	m104	JIM	It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
L327792	u1581	m104	NUMA	Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
L328218	u1568	m104	JIM	How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
L328217	u1579	m104	MILLER	Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
L328216	u1568	m104	JIM	And what would I have to do?
L328215	u1579	m104	MILLER	I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
L328214	u1579	m104	MILLER	Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
L328213	u1568	m104	JIM	The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
L328212	u1579	m104	MILLER	I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
L328209	u1568	m104	JIM	That's it.
L328208	u1579	m104	MILLER	That's all you've had all this time?
L328207	u1568	m104	JIM	Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
L328206	u1579	m104	MILLER	How many men are working with you on this?
L328205	u1568	m104	JIM	If you must know, virtually nothing.
L328204	u1579	m104	MILLER	I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
L328203	u1568	m104	JIM	I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
L328202	u1579	m104	MILLER	You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
L328201	u1568	m104	JIM	Germany.
L328200	u1579	m104	MILLER	Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
L328199	u1579	m104	MILLER	Splendid, love to see them.
L328198	u1568	m104	JIM	They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
L328197	u1568	m104	JIM	We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
L328196	u1579	m104	MILLER	I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
L328195	u1568	m104	JIM	Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
L328194	u1579	m104	MILLER	I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
L328193	u1579	m104	MILLER	Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
L328192	u1568	m104	JIM	Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
L328515	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Uh huh.
L328514	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Do you walk home?
L328513	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Yes.
L328512	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	And you get of from school at 3 every day?
L328510	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	And how tall are you?
L328509	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Six.
L328508	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
L328507	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	That sounds fun.
L328506	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
L328505	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Virginia.
L328504	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Virginia or Elizabeth?
L328503	u1587	m104	VIRGINIA	Yes?
L328502	u1575	m104	MALE VOICE	Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
L327860	u1584	m104	RUBY	Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
L327859	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
L327858	u1584	m104	RUBY	But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
L327857	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
L327856	u1584	m104	RUBY	What are they?
L327855	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
L327854	u1584	m104	RUBY	Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
L327853	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
L327852	u1584	m104	RUBY	When are you going back to Washington, sir?
L327851	u1583	m104	OFFICIAL	Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
L327850	u1584	m104	RUBY	Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
L364677	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
L364676	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Yeah.
L364675	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
L364674	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
L364673	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
L364672	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
L364671	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
L364670	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
L364669	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
L364668	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	That really you, Red?
L364667	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Take it easy, baby.
L364333	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Now.
L364332	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let Billie finish.
L364331	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	That's what it is. Walk on out.
L364330	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
L364329	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	There's two guns on you.
L364328	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm wearing, Archie.
L364327	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I don't want your money.
L364326	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'll give you back the 600.
L364325	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You know it.
L364324	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
L364323	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
L364322	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You're a damn liar.
L364315	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
L364314	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.

L364311	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The bitch was there.
L364310	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You never had it.
L364309	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
L364308	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
L364307	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
L364306	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You owe me six big ones.

L364277	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.

L364223	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.

L364211	u1957	m128	ARCHIE	That's a fact. What you do, boy?
L364210	u1977	m128	SAMMY	Man live by his rep.
L364946	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
L364945	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle.
L364944	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
L364685	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
L364684	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
L364590	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to. God knows I want to.
L364589	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
L364588	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't know how.
L364587	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Tell Him that.
L364586	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
L364585	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
L364584	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't know what to say to Allah.
L364583	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	-- the hardest and the greatest.
L364582	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
L364581	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
L364580	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I can't.
L364579	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	-- the hardest and the greatest.
L364578	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
L364577	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
L364576	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I can't.
L364575	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
L364574	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I will do it.
L364573	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
L364572	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
L364571	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	The body is a holy repository.
L364569	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	"No. Elijah Muhammad does not say ""that white man is a devil."" He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men."
L364568	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I sure met some.
L364567	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
L364566	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Then the devil is white.
L364565	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
L364563	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Who are you?
L364562	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
L364561	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
L364560	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Little.
L364557	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
L364556	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	A black man playing big league ball is something.
L364555	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
L364547	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
L364546	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
L364545	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
L364544	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
L364535	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Read it and keep on reading.
L364534	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
L364533	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
L364532	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Where am I gonna start?
L364531	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
L364530	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
L364528	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
L364527	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
L364526	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Then what you telling me to study in them for?
L364525	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
L364524	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
L364518	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
L364517	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I can't make out that shit.
L364513	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Okay, okay. Show me, man.
L364512	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
L364511	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What the hell for, man?
L364510	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
L364509	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What for?
L364508	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
L364507	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What? Everybody knows God is White.
L364506	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
L364505	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
L364504	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
L364503	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's what Mama used to say.
L364502	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
L364501	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you do with your time?
L364500	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Don't con me.
L364499	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Okay, okay.
L364498	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Don't con me. Don't try...
L364497	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
L364496	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
L364495	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"You the only cat don't come on with that ""Whatcha know, daddy"" jive; and you don't cuss none."
L364494	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
L364493	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
L364492	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
L364488	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
L364487	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Elijah who?
L364486	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
L364484	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
L364483	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, I don't want to hear all that.
L364482	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
L364480	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
L364479	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Leggo. I got to wash it out.
L364478	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I ain't said I'm ashamed.
L364477	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
L364476	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
L364475	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Why? Why does everybody conk?
L364474	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
L364473	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Putting all that poison in your hair.
L364472	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
L364471	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You ain't lying.
L364467	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
L364466	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What did you give it to me for then?
L364465	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
L364464	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
L364463	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
L364462	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
L364460	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
L364459	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
L364458	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, what do you want?
L364457	u1958	m128	BEMBRY	Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
L364456	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Who the hell are you?
L364867	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
L364866	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	I'll have it tomorrow.
L364797	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
L364796	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
L364795	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
L364794	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
L364793	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Do you?
L364791	u1959	m128	BENJAMIN	Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
L364790	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What can I do for you?
L365084	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
L365083	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Make it plain.
L365066	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
L365065	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	Next week, Brother Minister.
L365064	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
L365062	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
L365061	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	No, Brother Minister.
L365060	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is the program ready?
L364875	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Come, sit with us.
L364874	u1960	m128	BENJAMIN 2X	All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
L364873	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You are now Benjamin 2X.
L365047	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't think that's such a good idea.
L365046	u1961	m128	BETTY	I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
L365045	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
L365044	u1961	m128	BETTY	Dear heart, where are you?
L365043	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
L365042	u1961	m128	BETTY	Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
L365041	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Betty it's me. It's me.
L365040	u1961	m128	BETTY	Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
L365011	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
L365010	u1961	m128	BETTY	Dear heart, I love you.
L365009	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
L365008	u1961	m128	BETTY	Shhh!
L365007	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
L365006	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You have to sleep for three.
L365005	u1961	m128	BETTY	Get some sleep.
L364933	u1961	m128	BETTY	Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
L364932	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you want me to do?
L364931	u1961	m128	BETTY	We need you too!
L364930	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
L364929	u1961	m128	BETTY	Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
L364928	u1961	m128	BETTY	Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
L364927	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
L364926	u1961	m128	BETTY	What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
L364925	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
L364924	u1961	m128	BETTY	A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
L364923	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
L364922	u1961	m128	BETTY	Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
L364921	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
L364920	u1961	m128	BETTY	"No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in ""Muhammad Speaks"" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own."
L364919	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
L364918	u1961	m128	BETTY	To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
L364917	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
L364916	u1961	m128	BETTY	Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957...
L364915	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
L364914	u1961	m128	BETTY	Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children...
L364913	u1961	m128	BETTY	We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
L364912	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
L364911	u1961	m128	BETTY	The talk is everywhere!
L364910	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Talk about what?
L364909	u1961	m128	BETTY	We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
L364908	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I just want to sit here and be still.
L364907	u1961	m128	BETTY	I'm not made of glass.
L364906	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
L364904	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How do you know?
L364903	u1961	m128	BETTY	Because you're in trouble.
L364902	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Why are you looking at me like that?
L364828	u1961	m128	BETTY	The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
L364827	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What do you think?
L364826	u1961	m128	BETTY	I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
L364825	u1961	m128	BETTY	You're with me even when you're away.
L364824	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'll be away a lot.
L364823	u1961	m128	BETTY	Hush your mouth.
L364822	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It will be rough.
L364821	u1961	m128	BETTY	Just hold me.
L364820	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It won't be easy.
L364819	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I love you.
L364818	u1961	m128	BETTY	Yes. Did you eat?
L364817	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I think so. Can you catch a plane?
L364816	u1961	m128	BETTY	Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
L364815	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Did you hear what I said?
L364814	u1961	m128	BETTY	Yes.
L364813	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
L364812	u1961	m128	BETTY	I know.
L364811	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm in Detroit.
L364738	u1961	m128	BETTY	Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
L364737	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What have you set your mind to?
L364736	u1961	m128	BETTY	And dogged when I set my mind to something.
L364735	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Are you?
L364734	u1961	m128	BETTY	There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
L364733	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How old are you, Betty?
L364732	u1961	m128	BETTY	But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
L364731	u1961	m128	BETTY	If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
L364730	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Just an idle question.
L364729	u1961	m128	BETTY	Why do you ask?
L364728	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
L364727	u1961	m128	BETTY	You have enough worries of your own.
L364726	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
L364725	u1961	m128	BETTY	I can handle it.
L364724	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
L364723	u1961	m128	BETTY	Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
L364722	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
L364721	u1961	m128	BETTY	There's nothing to talk about.
L364720	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let's talk about you for a change.
L364719	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Delicious.
L364718	u1961	m128	BETTY	How do you like it?
L364717	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
L364716	u1961	m128	BETTY	What?
L364715	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
L364713	u1961	m128	BETTY	You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
L364712	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
L364711	u1961	m128	BETTY	Could we sit down someplace?
L364710	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
L364709	u1961	m128	BETTY	I see your point.
L364705	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
L364704	u1961	m128	BETTY	Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
L364701	u1961	m128	BETTY	That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
L364700	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What points?
L364697	u1961	m128	BETTY	Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
L364696	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
L364693	u1961	m128	BETTY	If you want to tell me.
L364692	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
L364690	u1961	m128	BETTY	She ate.
L364689	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What?
L365079	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Down front as always.
L365078	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is my family here yet?
L365077	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Let's cancel.
L365076	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
L365075	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Brother Minister, what is wrong?
L365072	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What did I tell you about assuming?
L365071	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I assumed...
L365070	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
L365069	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
L365068	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
L365067	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
L365038	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
L365037	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
L365036	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
L365035	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Let some of us come down there.
L365034	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
L365033	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
L365032	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brother Earl.
L365025	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	Let's get out of this cold.
L365024	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
L364787	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That's enough, Brother Earl.
L364786	u1962	m128	BROTHER EARL	I'm tired of praying.
L364785	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
L364628	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
L364627	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Just what are you saying?
L364626	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
L364625	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Now just a moment, just a moment --
L364624	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Then we don't know that God was white.
L364623	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	I told you we don't know for certain.
L364622	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What color were the original Hebrews?
L364621	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Just what is your question?
L364620	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
L364619	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	That's right.
L364618	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	They were Hebrew, weren't they?
L364617	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	I don't think we know for certain.
L364616	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
L364615	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Why don't you just ask your question?
L364450	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
L364449	u1963	m128	CHAPLAIN GILL	Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
L364858	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, ""Let's go, let's separate"", he'd yell, ""Yeah, man, any place is better than this."" You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one."
L364857	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Let him finish.
L364852	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
L364851	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Entirely.
L364850	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: ""Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture."" Would you agree?"
L364849	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	You put it very well.
L364848	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"Stop me if I'm wrong. I ""polarize the community."" I ""erroneously appraise the racial picture."""
L364845	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, ""Do you hate me!"" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate."
L364844	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
L364843	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Please, go ahead.
L364842	u1964	m128	DR. PAYSON	Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
L364957	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
L364956	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yes, sir, I did.
L364955	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	Did you see the papers today?
L364802	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Allah Akbar.
L364801	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
L364800	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let me do it then.
L364799	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
L364695	u1965	m128	ELIJAH	Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
L364694	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	If you want to tell me.
L364899	u1966	m128	GREGORY	If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
L364898	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Say what you're saying.
L364897	u1966	m128	GREGORY	His greatest greatness.
L364896	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What?
L364895	u1966	m128	GREGORY	Are you Elijah's pimp?
L364894	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sure, man.
L364893	u1966	m128	GREGORY	Can I ask you something?
L364298	u1967	m128	HONEY	Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
L364297	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Is she hooking?
L364296	u1967	m128	HONEY	If she got eyes, she do.
L364295	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	She know?
L364294	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	With him?
L364293	u1967	m128	HONEY	'Bout every other night, Red.
L364292	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
L364291	u1967	m128	HONEY	You know that gal?
L364286	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
L364285	u1967	m128	HONEY	And like a fool I believe it.
L364284	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I say a lot of things.
L364283	u1967	m128	HONEY	I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
L364419	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
L364418	u1968	m128	JUDGE	The sentences to run concurrently.
L364417	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
L364416	u1968	m128	JUDGE	Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
L364415	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
L364414	u1968	m128	JUDGE	Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
L364413	u1982	m128	VOICE OF MALCOLM X	The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
L364134	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
L364133	u1969	m128	LAURA	Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
L364132	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Let's go.
L364130	u1969	m128	LAURA	I do know I love you.
L364129	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
L364128	u1969	m128	LAURA	Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
L364082	u1969	m128	LAURA	What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
L364081	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
L364080	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
L364079	u1969	m128	LAURA	I know where you're going.
L364078	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I mean it's late, baby.
L364077	u1969	m128	LAURA	I ain't stupid.
L364076	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I better not come in.
L364069	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Now you come back.
L364068	u1969	m128	LAURA	'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
L364152	u1970	m128	LOUISE	If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
L364151	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
L364150	u1970	m128	LOUISE	Did you hear me?!
L364149	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	Your control over your children, therefore --
L364148	u1970	m128	LOUISE	Get out.
L364147	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
L364146	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
L364145	u1970	m128	LOUISE	These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
L364144	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	-- there is a serious question as to whether --
L364143	u1970	m128	LOUISE	Murder.
L364142	u1973	m128	MISS DUNNE	It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
L364972	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	And don't come back.
L364971	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	You're my father.
L364970	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
L364969	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Let me die then.
L364968	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	No. You'll be marked for death.
L364967	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	I'm with you, Brother Minister.
L364966	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What does Sidney say?
L364965	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
L364964	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What mission?
L364963	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
L364962	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How long has this been going on?
L364961	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Another one?
L364892	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Please make way, please --
L364891	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
L364634	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
L364633	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
L364632	u1979	m128	SIDNEY	500.
L364631	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How many you turning out?
L364335	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
L364334	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You had the number.
L364276	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Well, bitch you move too slow.
L364275	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
L364126	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
L364125	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You will, baby -- if the time come.
L364124	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Me?
L364123	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	"Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler ""rape,"" sister?"
L364118	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What's your story, baby?
L364117	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You evil this morning.
L364115	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You better believe it.
L364114	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You the man.
L364113	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You hear me, girl?
L364112	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	Sweetie, they're almost ready.
L364111	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	C'mere.
L364110	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
L364092	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
L364091	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
L364090	u1981	m128	SOPHIA	...That isn't a whore?
L364089	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
L364659	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
L364658	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
L364657	u1978	m128	SHORTY	You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
L364656	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
L364655	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
L364654	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
L364653	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
L364652	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
L364651	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
L364405	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
L364404	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
L364403	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yeah.
L364402	u1978	m128	SHORTY	What did you do, Homey, palm it?
L364400	u1978	m128	SHORTY	You the man!
L364399	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
L364379	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Tell him about Baldy.
L364378	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	That ain't bad.
L364367	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
L364366	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
L364365	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
L364364	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I ain't doing bad.
L364363	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
L364102	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I'm not too short to be Cagney.
L364101	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You're too small to be Bogart.
L364100	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
L364099	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	The hell you are.
L364098	u1978	m128	SHORTY	I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
L364097	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
L364096	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Bang, bang. You're dead.
L364095	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Eat lead, coppers.
L364094	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
L364073	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
L364072	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
L364071	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Fine as May wine.
L364070	u1978	m128	SHORTY	That's a fine chick.
L364067	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Shorty, this is Laura.
L364066	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Hey, man, gimme some skin.
L364049	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Well, all reet, then.
L364048	u1978	m128	SHORTY	Well, all right, then.
L364398	u1976	m128	RUDY	Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
L364397	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
L364390	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
L364389	u1976	m128	RUDY	I'm the man.
L364388	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Head nigger in charge?
L364387	u1976	m128	RUDY	That's right.
L364386	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	You want to be the head man?
L364385	u1976	m128	RUDY	Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
L364384	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Might be all right.
L364383	u1976	m128	RUDY	So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
L364382	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	So what about him?
L364381	u1976	m128	RUDY	Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
L364375	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	What can you do?
L364374	u1976	m128	RUDY	I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
L364768	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
L364767	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	Watch your tongue, boy.
L364766	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Only a pig could do a thing like that.
L364761	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	Eddie, let's see that blotter.
L364760	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Brothers of Brother Johnson.
L364759	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	Who the hell are they?
L364757	u1975	m128	PLAINCLOTHES	You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
L364756	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
L364942	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Allah will provide.
L364941	u1980	m128	SISTER LUCILLE	Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
L364940	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	Are you sure?
L364939	u1980	m128	SISTER LUCILLE	Yes sir.
L364938	u1971	m128	MALCOLM	He told you that?
L364937	u1980	m128	SISTER LUCILLE	Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
L364161	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
L364160	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
L364159	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	They talked about me like
L364158	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	He's bright.
L364157	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
L364156	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
L364155	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
L364154	u1974	m128	MRS. SWERLIN	This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
L364153	u1972	m128	MALCOLM'S VOICE	We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
L457288	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
L457287	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
L457286	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
L457280	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
L457279	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
L457278	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
L457277	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
L457276	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- and the listless ones do the binding.
L457271	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
L457270	u2529	m164	ABBE DU MAUPAS	I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
L457269	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
L456504	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
L456503	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
L456497	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	Then what's he doing here?
L456496	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	He's a writer, not a madman.
L456495	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
L456494	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Once or twice.
L456493	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
L456490	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	No one's forcing you to listen.
L456489	u2530	m164	CHARLOTTE	We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
L456488	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --
L457175	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	...a poker... he took a poker from the fire...
L457174	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --
L457170	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --
L457169	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --
L457154	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles...
L457153	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle...
L457138	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Now give the signal.
L457137	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	At your service, Count.
L457136	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
L457135	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
L457134	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
L457133	u2531	m164	CLEANTE	Marquis? Is that you?
L457131	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
L457130	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
L457099	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You'll hate me now, won't you?
L457098	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
L457097	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	What? What've I done?
L457096	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Go back to your room. Quickly.
L457094	u2532	m164	COULMIER	They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
L457093	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Why not?
L457092	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
L457091	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Mother's not half so blind as you.
L457090	u2532	m164	COULMIER	By whom? The Marquis?
L457089	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
L457088	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Turn you out?
L457087	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't turn us out, Abbe.
L457069	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I've you to look after me, haven't I?
L457068	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
L457067	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Is that a promise you can truly keep?
L457066	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
L457065	u2532	m164	COULMIER	The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
L457064	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
L457063	u2532	m164	COULMIER	In part, yes.
L457015	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
L457014	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
L457013	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
L457012	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
L457011	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Ow!
L457010	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
L457009	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But why must you indulge in his pornography?
L457008	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
L457007	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
L457000	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Not now, or we're both done for.
L456999	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
L456763	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
L456762	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Has he hurt you?
L456548	u2532	m164	COULMIER	The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
L456547	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Yes, Abbe?
L456546	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madeleine --
L456486	u2532	m164	COULMIER	We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
L456485	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
L457263	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
L457262	u2545	m164	VALCOUR	I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
L457261	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I must grant him his last rites.
L457260	u2545	m164	VALCOUR	Mustn't do that, sir.
L457259	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Free his mouth.
L456566	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
L456565	u2545	m164	VALCOUR	They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
L457244	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Of course.
L457243	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Surely you'll grant me a final word.
L457242	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'm here.
L457241	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Abbe de Coulmier!
L457238	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
L457237	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
L457233	u2532	m164	COULMIER	We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
L457232	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
L457231	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Then it must've been love --
L457230	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	NEVER!
L457229	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Was it impotence?
L457228	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Who's to say I did not?
L457227	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Why was it you never took her by force?
L457226	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Go to hell!
L457225	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
L457224	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
L457223	u2532	m164	COULMIER	AND DID YOU?
L457222	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
L457221	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I know, because I felt it myself --
L457220	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't confuse one organ with another --
L457219	u2532	m164	COULMIER	-- the passion in your heart --
L457218	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	-- that was lust --
L457217	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I saw the longing in your eye --
L457216	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
L457215	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's no secret that you loved her.
L457214	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
L457213	u2532	m164	COULMIER	An innocent child is dead.
L457212	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
L457211	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Your words drove Bouchon to --
L457210	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
L456987	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Your wig. Remove your wig.
L456986	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
L456980	u2532	m164	COULMIER	NOW STRIP.
L456979	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
L456978	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
L456977	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Coulmier, you animal!
L456976	u2532	m164	COULMIER	OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
L456975	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
L456974	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
L456973	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	A night spent with the partner of my choice.
L456972	u2532	m164	COULMIER	What on earth would that require?
L456971	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
L456970	u2532	m164	COULMIER	What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
L456969	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	A man after my own heart...
L456968	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
L456937	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
L456936	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
L456935	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
L456934	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Because your writing continues, unchecked.
L456933	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
L456932	u2532	m164	COULMIER	-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
L456931	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	-- water! --
L456930	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
L456929	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
L456925	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Valcour. His chair.
L456924	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
L456923	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
L456922	u2532	m164	COULMIER	His rug.
L456921	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
L456799	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	THEN BUGGER ME!
L456798	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Good day, Marquis.
L456797	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
L456796	u2532	m164	COULMIER	That's enough.
L456795	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Part the gates of heaven, as it were --
L456794	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
L456793	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
L456792	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You always do.
L456791	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I have a proposition.
L456790	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
L456789	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
L456788	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
L456787	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
L456786	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
L456785	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
L456784	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
L456783	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
L456781	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
L456780	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	What the devil --
L456779	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
L456778	u2532	m164	COULMIER	How can one man possibly be so selfish?
L456777	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	He can't do that to me.
L456765	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
L456764	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You mean to take us all down with you?
L456665	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
L456664	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you only mean to dupe me again --
L456661	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Do I have your word?
L456660	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
L456658	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You among them?
L456657	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
L456656	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
L456655	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Mightier than the sword indeed.
L456654	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
L456653	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	They can't be serious.
L456652	u2532	m164	COULMIER	More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
L456651	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
L456650	u2532	m164	COULMIER	One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
L456649	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
L456648	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
L456647	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
L456646	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
L456645	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
L456644	u2532	m164	COULMIER	And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
L456643	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	There I was taxed; it's true.
L456642	u2532	m164	COULMIER	"It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like ""nipple"" and ""pikestaff"" --"
L456641	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	And --?
L456640	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Enough to discern its tenor.
L456639	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
L456638	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
L456637	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
L456636	u2532	m164	COULMIER	What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
L456635	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
L456563	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'll fill page after page, I promise.
L456562	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
L456561	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't be so sure.
L456560	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
L456559	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
L456558	u2532	m164	COULMIER	In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
L456557	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
L456556	u2532	m164	COULMIER	We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
L456555	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
L456551	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
L456550	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's not even noon --
L456549	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
L457293	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
L457292	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
L457253	u2532	m164	COULMIER	No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
L457252	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Will you sleep soundly tonight?
L457251	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
L457250	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And you? It must've been an ordeal.
L457249	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Poorly.
L457248	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	How is the patient faring?
L457247	u2532	m164	COULMIER	And my own.
L457246	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
L457206	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	HER NAME, ABBE.
L457205	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
L457204	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
L457203	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
L457202	u2532	m164	COULMIER	As you say, Doctor.
L457002	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You'd suffer in her stead?
L457001	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
L456996	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
L456995	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	This child let loose the beast from its cage --
L456994	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
L456993	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	He'll do no such thing.
L456909	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	What could cause a tincture like this?
L456908	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
L456775	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
L456774	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I'll do everything in my power --
L456773	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
L456772	u2532	m164	COULMIER	That's not our intent --
L456771	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
L456770	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	No. It most certainly was not.
L456769	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It was not inspired by circumstance.
L456768	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Of course.
L456767	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It was fiction, of course.
L456724	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Oh indeed?
L456723	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
L456676	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
L456675	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I have.
L456674	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
L456673	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
L456672	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He's sworn to obedience.
L456671	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And --?
L456670	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
L456669	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Well?
L456626	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
L456625	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And place my reputation at stake?
L456624	u2532	m164	COULMIER	On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
L456623	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You find this amusing, do you?
L456622	u2532	m164	COULMIER	A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
L456621	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You're a sentimental man.
L456620	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
L456619	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
L456618	u2532	m164	COULMIER	But he's one among some two hundred wards --
L456617	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
L456616	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Shut down?
L456615	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
L456614	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Yes?
L456613	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
L456612	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
L456611	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
L456610	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You have to believe me, I had no idea --
L456608	u2532	m164	COULMIER	For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
L456607	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Do you favor its publication?
L456606	u2532	m164	COULMIER	It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
L456605	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Well...?
L456604	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Oh. That.
L456603	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And his writing?
L456602	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
L456601	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
L456600	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
L456599	u2532	m164	COULMIER	A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
L456598	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And he's never once attempted escape?
L456597	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
L456596	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	His wife's?
L456595	u2532	m164	COULMIER	His wife's influence.
L456594	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
L456589	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
L456588	u2532	m164	COULMIER	He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
L456587	u2532	m164	COULMIER	I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
L456586	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
L456585	u2532	m164	COULMIER	A few indiscretions in his youth.
L456584	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
L456577	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
L456576	u2532	m164	COULMIER	If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
L456575	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
L456574	u2532	m164	COULMIER	You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
L456573	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It's a formality; truly.
L456572	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Of course.
L456571	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
L456570	u2532	m164	COULMIER	Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
L456471	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
L456470	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	Yes?
L456469	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
L456468	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	But I am history.
L456467	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
L456466	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	As for the author... shoot him.
L456464	u2540	m164	NAPOLEON	Enough!
L456463	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --
L456697	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben?; I look to the future.
L456696	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	"His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  ""There but for the grace of God""... eh, Doctor?"
L456482	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	"Do you know how I define ""idealism,"" Monsieur Delben??"
L456481	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
L456480	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
L456476	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben?. Mine is a higher mission.
L456475	u2533	m164	DELBEN?	Quite.
L456474	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
L456902	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
L456901	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
L456457	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
L456456	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I'll be waiting.
L456455	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
L456454	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I'll pass the word on, then.
L456453	u2534	m164	HORSEMAN	Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
L456452	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Here it is; the last chapter.
L456760	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
L456759	u2535	m164	INGENUE	What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
L456758	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
L456757	u2535	m164	INGENUE	I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
L456756	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	"I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry ""no more!"""
L456754	u2535	m164	INGENUE	Was ever a man more risqu?? He wants to take me every way!
L456753	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
L456746	u2535	m164	INGENUE	Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou?!
L456745	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
L456738	u2535	m164	INGENUE	Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
L456737	u2536	m164	LIBERTINE	At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
L457062	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
L457061	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
L456911	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
L456910	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
L456900	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Well worth the dig!
L456899	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Yes?
L456898	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman...
L456897	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
L456896	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	A habitu? of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years.
L456894	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	Come now, darling, give it a read.
L456893	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
L456892	u2537	m164	MADAME LECLERC	If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
L457159	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	"What shall I ready? asked Fanchon. ""My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"""
L457158	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	...yes, I've got that bit...
L457126	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
L457125	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
L457124	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
L457123	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
L457122	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
L457121	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
L457120	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Go on, child.
L457119	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
L457118	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
L457117	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
L457116	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It needn't be; not if you've another story.
L457114	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
L457113	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
L457112	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
L457111	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
L457110	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
L457109	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
L457108	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's only been described to me. In your books.
L457107	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Surely you've seen a man naked.
L457106	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
L457105	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	They've taken your clothes?
L456950	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I don't believe it!
L456949	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
L456946	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
L456945	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	What have they done to you now?
L456541	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	What's that then?
L456540	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
L456539	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
L456538	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
L456537	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	It's a long story, this one.
L456533	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
L456532	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
L456531	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
L456530	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	A kiss for each page.
L456528	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Fiendishly so.
L456527	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Is it terribly erotic?
L456526	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Most assuredly.
L456525	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Is it awfully violent?
L456524	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
L456523	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
L456522	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
L456521	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
L456520	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	There's something else I want from you.
L456519	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
L456518	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
L456517	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
L456515	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
L456514	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
L456513	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
L456512	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Did I frighten you?
L456509	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
L456508	u2538	m164	MADELEINE	Don't start --
L456507	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	I'm hungry for a proper visit.
L457078	u2543	m164	SIMONE	No. But tell him I would.
L457077	u2539	m164	MONSIEUR PROUIX	You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
L457076	u2543	m164	SIMONE	Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
L457075	u2539	m164	MONSIEUR PROUIX	By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond...
L457074	u2543	m164	SIMONE	Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
L457073	u2539	m164	MONSIEUR PROUIX	...your wife.
L457035	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
L457034	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
L457033	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
L457025	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
L457024	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
L457021	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
L457020	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
L457019	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	This is neither the time nor the place --
L457018	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
L457017	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Good God, Marquise --
L456875	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
L456874	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Of course.
L456873	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
L456872	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	And I in yours.
L456871	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I am eternally in your debt.
L456868	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
L456867	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Don't toy with me, Doctor.
L456865	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
L456864	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	-- words alone are insufficient.
L456863	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Oh, but I am!
L456862	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
L456861	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
L456860	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	What thought is that?
L456859	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
L456858	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	It's tainted money, Doctor.
L456857	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
L456856	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I am not a wealthy woman.
L456855	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
L456854	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
L456853	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
L456852	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
L456848	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
L456847	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
L456844	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
L456843	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
L456842	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I pray you: be succinct.
L456841	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
L456840	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
L456839	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
L456838	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
L456829	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
L456828	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
L456827	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
L456826	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
L456825	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
L456824	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
L456821	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
L456820	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	They've put you up to this, haven't they?
L456819	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
L456818	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	You've come to lecture me?
L456817	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
L456816	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
L456815	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	How was I to know, my darling?
L456813	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	Forgive me, I beg you --
L456812	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
L456811	u2541	m164	RENEE PELAGIE	....shame on you, truly...
L456810	u2544	m164	THE MARQUIS	Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
L456884	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	You prefer a book to your husband's company?
L456883	u2543	m164	SIMONE	I'd rather read, thank-you.
L456882	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
L456881	u2543	m164	SIMONE	Very much.
L456880	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Doesn't that please you?
L456743	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Do as I say.
L456742	u2543	m164	SIMONE	But it's just begun --
L456741	u2542	m164	ROYER-COLLARD	Leave at once --
L607893	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
L607892	u3286	m218	ADMIRAL ANDERSON	Yes, sir.
L607891	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
L607890	u3286	m218	ADMIRAL ANDERSON	With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
L607889	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
L607888	u3286	m218	ADMIRAL ANDERSON	Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
L607887	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	Starshells.
L607882	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	What --
L607881	u3286	m218	ADMIRAL ANDERSON	Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
L607879	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	Admiral, I asked you a question.
L607878	u3286	m218	ADMIRAL ANDERSON	Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
L607877	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	What are you doing?
L607876	u3286	m218	ADMIRAL ANDERSON	We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
L607595	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
L607594	u3286	m218	ADMIRAL ANDERSON	Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
L608108	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Tomorrow...
L608107	u3289	m218	DOBRYNIN	Tomorrow...
L608106	u3287	m218	BOBBY	With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
L608105	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
L608104	u3289	m218	DOBRYNIN	And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
L608103	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Yes.
L608102	u3289	m218	DOBRYNIN	This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
L608117	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
L608116	u3287	m218	BOBBY	How does a guy get a rep like that?
L608114	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
L608113	u3287	m218	BOBBY	He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
L608112	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
L608038	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
L608037	u3287	m218	BOBBY	He gets it, but he's pissed.
L607770	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
L607769	u3287	m218	BOBBY	We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
L607562	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	We've got bigger problems right now.
L607561	u3287	m218	BOBBY	We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
L607560	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
L607559	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
L607533	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Then you'll call, right?
L607532	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Well, I'm not.
L607523	u3287	m218	BOBBY	What if I can't?
L607522	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
L607521	u3287	m218	BOBBY	We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
L607520	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
L607510	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
L607509	u3287	m218	BOBBY	There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
L607470	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
L607469	u3287	m218	BOBBY	As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
L607406	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
L607405	u3287	m218	BOBBY	What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
L607404	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
L607403	u3287	m218	BOBBY	He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
L607357	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
L607356	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
L607355	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
L607353	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Where the hell are you?
L607352	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Good.
L608126	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Kenny. It's over.
L608125	u3293	m218	KENNY	Yeah?
L608085	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
L608084	u3293	m218	KENNY	Smoke.
L608083	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Slow down. Smell that?
L608079	u3293	m218	KENNY	Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
L608078	u3287	m218	BOBBY	We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
L608035	u3287	m218	BOBBY	And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
L608034	u3293	m218	KENNY	So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
L608033	u3287	m218	BOBBY	All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
L608030	u3293	m218	KENNY	-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
L608029	u3287	m218	BOBBY	The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
L608028	u3293	m218	KENNY	And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
L608027	u3287	m218	BOBBY	And?
L607963	u3287	m218	BOBBY	They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
L607962	u3293	m218	KENNY	What does the letter say?
L607961	u3287	m218	BOBBY	We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
L607960	u3287	m218	BOBBY	We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
L607959	u3293	m218	KENNY	Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
L607958	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
L607832	u3287	m218	BOBBY	He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
L607831	u3293	m218	KENNY	Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
L607830	u3293	m218	KENNY	-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
L607829	u3287	m218	BOBBY	My father --
L607828	u3293	m218	KENNY	Something your father would've come up with.
L607827	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Oh, still sore about this.
L607826	u3287	m218	BOBBY	What's gotten into you?
L607825	u3293	m218	KENNY	Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
L607824	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Zorin will eat him alive!
L607823	u3293	m218	KENNY	You can't take him out this late in the game.
L607822	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
L607794	u3293	m218	KENNY	We can't do that, Bobby.
L607793	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
L607792	u3293	m218	KENNY	Jesus...
L607766	u3293	m218	KENNY	Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
L607765	u3287	m218	BOBBY	What happened to speak when spoken to?
L607468	u3293	m218	KENNY	He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
L607467	u3287	m218	BOBBY	Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
L607413	u3287	m218	BOBBY	It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
L607412	u3293	m218	KENNY	It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
L607411	u3287	m218	BOBBY	I'll do it.
L607410	u3287	m218	BOBBY	We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
L607409	u3293	m218	KENNY	They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
L607408	u3287	m218	BOBBY	...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
L607407	u3293	m218	KENNY	The other thing is...
L607359	u3287	m218	BOBBY	You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
L607358	u3293	m218	KENNY	Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
L608144	u3288	m218	BUNDY	Says what, Kenny?
L608143	u3293	m218	KENNY	Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
L608141	u3293	m218	KENNY	It shouldn't have. But it did.
L608140	u3288	m218	BUNDY	Yeah.
L608139	u3293	m218	KENNY	The sun came up today.
L607810	u3288	m218	BUNDY	You know I don't mean they're weak.
L607809	u3293	m218	KENNY	-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
L607808	u3288	m218	BUNDY	Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
L607807	u3288	m218	BUNDY	No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
L607806	u3293	m218	KENNY	Yes it is.
L607805	u3288	m218	BUNDY	Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
L607804	u3293	m218	KENNY	Then they should speak up.
L607803	u3288	m218	BUNDY	You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
L607801	u3293	m218	KENNY	I think it's a bad idea.
L607800	u3288	m218	BUNDY	What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
L607716	u3288	m218	BUNDY	I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
L607715	u3293	m218	KENNY	Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
L607334	u3288	m218	BUNDY	Cuba.
L607333	u3293	m218	KENNY	What's it about?
L607330	u3288	m218	BUNDY	No, Ken. I need to see him now...
L607329	u3293	m218	KENNY	Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
L607943	u3298	m218	SCALI	48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
L607942	u3290	m218	FOMIN	John. How much time?
L607941	u3298	m218	SCALI	Time is of the essence.
L607940	u3290	m218	FOMIN	And the second condition?
L607939	u3290	m218	FOMIN	And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
L607938	u3298	m218	SCALI	Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
L607937	u3290	m218	FOMIN	This is from the Highest Authority?
L607936	u3298	m218	SCALI	That is correct.
L607935	u3290	m218	FOMIN	So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
L607934	u3298	m218	SCALI	I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
L608005	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
L608004	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
L607988	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
L607987	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
L607976	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
L607975	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
L607789	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
L607788	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
L607787	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
L607702	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	All right. Then I guess it's time.
L607701	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	Still heading for Cuba.
L607700	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
L607492	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
L607491	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	How long until the army is ready?
L607441	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
L607440	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
L607439	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
L607438	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	An invasion...
L607437	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
L607369	u3291	m218	GENERAL TAYLOR	McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
L607368	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Max.
L608122	u3293	m218	KENNY	No. I'm glad I'm home.
L608121	u3292	m218	HELEN	I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
L607957	u3292	m218	HELEN	A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
L607956	u3293	m218	KENNY	-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
L607955	u3292	m218	HELEN	If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
L607712	u3293	m218	KENNY	I'll be evacuated with the President.
L607711	u3292	m218	HELEN	What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
L607710	u3293	m218	KENNY	Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
L607709	u3292	m218	HELEN	What's happened?
L607708	u3293	m218	KENNY	I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
L607707	u3292	m218	HELEN	When are you going to be home?
L607289	u3293	m218	KENNY	Kids are supposed to get detention.
L607288	u3292	m218	HELEN	Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
L607541	u3297	m218	RESTON	This is about Cuba.
L607540	u3293	m218	KENNY	Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
L607539	u3297	m218	RESTON	There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
L607478	u3297	m218	RESTON	I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
L607477	u3293	m218	KENNY	Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
L607476	u3297	m218	RESTON	Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
L607475	u3293	m218	KENNY	He was.
L607474	u3297	m218	RESTON	Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
L607424	u3297	m218	RESTON	Deal.
L607423	u3293	m218	KENNY	Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
L607422	u3297	m218	RESTON	It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
L607327	u3297	m218	RESTON	Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
L607326	u3293	m218	KENNY	Forget it, Scotty.
L607325	u3297	m218	RESTON	Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
L607322	u3297	m218	RESTON	I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
L607321	u3293	m218	KENNY	Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
L607320	u3297	m218	RESTON	Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
L607319	u3293	m218	KENNY	I said his heart, not his attention.
L607318	u3297	m218	RESTON	I want an hour with him.
L607317	u3293	m218	KENNY	Busy. But you've got his heart.
L607316	u3297	m218	RESTON	How's my favorite President?
L608025	u3293	m218	KENNY	Back to work.
L608024	u3294	m218	KEVIN	What about you? Where are you going?
L608023	u3293	m218	KENNY	Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
L608021	u3293	m218	KENNY	I, uh...
L608020	u3294	m218	KEVIN	I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
L608017	u3294	m218	KEVIN	Yeah.
L608016	u3293	m218	KENNY	Hey, sport. You winning?
L607292	u3293	m218	KENNY	Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
L607291	u3294	m218	KEVIN	Dean Rusk!
L607290	u3293	m218	KENNY	Secretary of Defense...
L608058	u3293	m218	KENNY	And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
L608057	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
L607933	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Okay, Ken. We're going.
L607932	u3293	m218	KENNY	Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
L607931	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	You're sure...
L607930	u3293	m218	KENNY	They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
L607929	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
L607928	u3293	m218	KENNY	Hello?
L607866	u3293	m218	KENNY	Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
L607865	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
L607819	u3293	m218	KENNY	Yeah, a good political solution.
L607818	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
L607817	u3293	m218	KENNY	Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
L607816	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
L607815	u3293	m218	KENNY	If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
L607814	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I don't want to listen to this again.
L607813	u3293	m218	KENNY	Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
L607812	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	What's that?
L607796	u3293	m218	KENNY	And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
L607795	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
L607768	u3293	m218	KENNY	Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
L607767	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
L607630	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
L607629	u3293	m218	KENNY	That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
L607627	u3293	m218	KENNY	Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
L607626	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
L607624	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I'm gonna protect those pilots.
L607623	u3293	m218	KENNY	I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
L607622	u3293	m218	KENNY	Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
L607621	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
L607620	u3293	m218	KENNY	What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
L607619	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I know, I know...
L607618	u3293	m218	KENNY	All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
L607617	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
L607616	u3293	m218	KENNY	I don't like what's happening.
L607582	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
L607581	u3293	m218	KENNY	You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
L607564	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I don't know. I don't know.
L607563	u3293	m218	KENNY	We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
L607531	u3293	m218	KENNY	Damn right I'm scared.
L607530	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	You're scared to cancel on Daly.
L607529	u3293	m218	KENNY	I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
L607528	u3293	m218	KENNY	No way.
L607527	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I don't care. Cancel it.
L607526	u3293	m218	KENNY	You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
L607525	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
L607480	u3293	m218	KENNY	Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
L607479	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Let's get out of here.
L607464	u3293	m218	KENNY	There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
L607463	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
L607462	u3293	m218	KENNY	Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
L607416	u3293	m218	KENNY	Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
L607415	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
L607402	u3293	m218	KENNY	There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
L607401	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
L607351	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Good.
L607350	u3293	m218	KENNY	Should be here any minute.
L607341	u3293	m218	KENNY	Not as far as the election goes.
L607340	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Still think Cuba isn't important?
L607308	u3293	m218	KENNY	Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
L607307	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	So what've we got today?
L607306	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I was, you bastard.
L607305	u3293	m218	KENNY	No you weren't.
L607304	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	I was eating that.
L608062	u3293	m218	KENNY	And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
L608061	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
L607779	u3293	m218	KENNY	You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
L607778	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
L607777	u3293	m218	KENNY	Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
L607776	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
L607774	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
L607773	u3293	m218	KENNY	Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
L608060	u3293	m218	KENNY	Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
L608059	u3295	m218	MCCONE	It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
L607966	u3293	m218	KENNY	Jesus Christ...
L607965	u3295	m218	MCCONE	My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
L607908	u3295	m218	MCCONE	That may be what they want us to think.
L607907	u3293	m218	KENNY	That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
L607906	u3295	m218	MCCONE	Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
L607905	u3293	m218	KENNY	Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
L607744	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Will somebody find out what's going on?!
L607743	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	Just a second, Mr. President.
L607742	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
L607741	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
L607740	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
L607734	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
L607733	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
L607395	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
L607394	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Bob?
L607366	u3296	m218	MCNAMARA	Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
L607365	u3299	m218	THE PRESIDENT	Bob. Bet you had a late night.
L29956	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
L29955	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
L29941	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Goddamnit!--
L29940	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	You overslept?
L29930	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Only everything...
L29929	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
L29928	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Hmm?
L29927	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Woodward?
L29908	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
L29907	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
L29906	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
L29905	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	How many fucking sources they think we got?--
L29893	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
L29892	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
L29887	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
L29886	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--Jesus--
L29877	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Maybe we are...
L29876	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
L29875	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
L29874	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	What's the matter?
L29873	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It's nothing personal, though. 
L29872	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
L29871	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
L29870	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Nah.  Maybe.
L29869	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Haldeman.
L29868	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Who?
L29867	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I think that's him.
L29855	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
L29854	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
L29853	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
L29835	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	We're inside the White House now.
L29834	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	He'll give us a sworn statement.
L29799	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
L29798	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
L29797	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
L29796	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
L29755	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
L29754	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	What would you have done?
L29721	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--'cause I only know four chords--
L29720	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
L29719	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	"Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, ""No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."""
L29718	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
L29717	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	If he self-destructed.
L29716	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
L29715	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
L29714	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
L29713	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
L29712	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
L29711	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--Haldeman I know, who else?
L29710	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
L29709	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	How high up, which Republicans?
L29708	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
L29707	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I haven't said anything--
L29706	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
L29703	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
L29702	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
L29701	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--has he got an ax?--
L29700	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--I know a lawyer at Justice--
L29699	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--shit, who do we know?--
L29698	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
L29697	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I know, I know--
L29696	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--we gotta top the Times--
L29695	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--shit--
L29694	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Goddamnit--
L29690	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
L29689	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
L29688	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
L29609	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
L29608	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
L29589	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--Colson.
L29588	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--there had to be a White House overseer--
L29564	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
L29563	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
L29551	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
L29550	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You want me to be the bastard.
L29549	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
L29548	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
L29547	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	How do you want to handle Sloan?
L29546	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	That happens to people.  OK, go on.
L29545	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
L29544	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--we will--
L29543	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
L29542	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
L29541	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
L29540	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Go on, go on--
L29539	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
L29494	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	You voted for him.
L29493	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Did he just say what I think he said?
L29486	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Nixon.
L29485	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	'68.
L29484	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	When?
L29483	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Who'd you vote for?
L29482	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Sure.
L29481	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Republican?
L29480	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	And I'm a Republican.
L29479	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I hate both parties.
L29473	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	We appreciate your position--really.
L29472	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
L29471	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	We understand your problem--
L29470	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It's safe, try it, you'll see.
L29469	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
L29466	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
L29465	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
L29464	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
L29463	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Anything you've got.
L29462	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Facts or theory?
L29461	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
L29460	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I never scared anyone before.
L29459	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
L29443	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	"My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, ""My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow.""  And I said, ""Am I supposed to do that?"" and he said, ""Absolutely, it's crucial."" So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, ""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" And I said, ""It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper.""  Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all."
L29442	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You're not a kid anymore.
L29441	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I don't get it... this really was my turf...
L29438	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
L29437	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Who's first?
L29435	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
L29434	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Were you eyebrow reading?
L29433	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
L29432	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	And?--And?--
L29431	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
L29430	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	See her?  Get anything?
L29279	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--you do?--with access to records?
L29278	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
L29277	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Why didn't we get that?
L29276	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
L29275	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--fifteen phone calls--
L29274	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--I'm trying--
L29273	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--see?--
L29272	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Goddamnit--
L29271	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	The fucking New York Times.
L29270	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	What's that?
L29240	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	And you haven't called him?--
L29239	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
L29238	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	That was fun.  What now?
L29234	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	About the past year.
L29233	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	July of '71.
L29230	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	We need a sympathetic face.
L29229	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
L29223	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
L29222	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--a spy, you mean?
L29221	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Maybe a political operative of some sort--
L29220	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
L29219	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--what do you think?--
L29201	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
L29200	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
L29199	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Hmm.
L29198	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Hey?
L29196	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
L29195	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
L29194	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
L29193	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
L29192	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
L29191	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Let me lay a little theory on you--
L29190	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	All right, what do we know?
L29189	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I was sure trying.
L29188	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
L29187	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
L29186	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
L29185	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Fuck you, Carl.
L29184	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Yeah?
L29183	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Carl?
L29182	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
L29181	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
L29178	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--read 'em both and you'll see--
L29177	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--no way--
L29176	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--mine's better--
L29175	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
L29174	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
L29173	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--Bradlee went to Harvard--
L29172	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
L29171	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
L29170	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
L29169	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
L29168	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--it was bullshit the way it was--
L29167	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--it was fine the way it was--
L29166	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
L29165	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
L29647	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	Oh.
L29646	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Night.
L29645	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	Morning or night?
L29644	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	11:30.
L29643	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	--what time is it?
L29642	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
L29641	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
L29640	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
L29639	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	--jeeeeeeeeesus--
L29638	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
L29637	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	--jeeeeeeesus--
L29636	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
L29635	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	--jeeeeeeesus--
L29634	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
L29633	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	--jeeeeeeesus--
L29632	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
L29631	u3626	m239	MITCHELL	What does it say?
L29356	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	This?  Naw...
L29355	u3617	m239	DARDIS	I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
L29352	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
L29351	u3617	m239	DARDIS	The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
L29350	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	The telephone calls... we know about that.
L29349	u3617	m239	DARDIS	I'll never get out of here in time.
L29348	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Whatever.
L29347	u3617	m239	DARDIS	You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
L29346	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I'm on deadline.
L29345	u3617	m239	DARDIS	Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
L29344	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
L29338	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
L29337	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	Well of course.
L29336	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
L29334	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	He is not in the car.  Sorry.
L29333	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
L29331	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	I told you, he had to go out on a case.
L29330	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
L29329	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	And you will.  But not now.
L29328	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
L29327	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	I'm so glad.
L29326	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
L29213	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
L29212	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--Teddy Kennedy?
L29211	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
L29210	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Any idea what he did?
L29209	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
L29208	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--Howard Hunt?
L29207	u3630	m239	SECRETARY	Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
L29752	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
L29751	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	Can't help you.
L29750	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
L29749	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
L29748	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	On the orders of Haldeman?
L29747	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	Sure--off the record.
L29746	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Chapin did contact you then?
L29745	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
L29744	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
L29743	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	But you know who did.
L29742	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	I didn't.
L29741	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
L29740	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
L29739	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
L29738	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
L29737	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Tell that to Muskie.
L29736	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	I didn't do anything wrong.
L29735	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Do you feel much about the things you did?
L29734	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	When did he hire you?
L29733	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	I know where Dwight works.
L29732	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	"By ""they"" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House."
L29731	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	"By ""they"" you mean...?"
L29730	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
L29729	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
L29728	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	I've got a lot of energy.
L29727	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
L29726	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Mind if I try?
L29725	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	You can't.
L29724	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
L29723	u3631	m239	SEGRETTI	That's right.
L29722	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Donald Segretti?
L29830	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	And?--
L29829	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
L29826	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	We've just been talking to Young--
L29825	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Speak.
L29613	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--yes--
L29612	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--you got more than one source?--
L29301	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
L29300	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
L29299	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	"--""I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto."" That was your spiel then. ""The Lifestyles of Deserters.""  I'm still waiting for it."
L29298	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--that was awhile ago--
L29297	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
L29296	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
L29295	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--so?
L29294	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
L29901	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--what about you?--
L29900	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Absolutely--
L29899	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
L29819	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
L29818	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
L29693	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
L29692	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--there's nothing new in it--
L29691	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
L29687	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--what?--
L29686	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
L29657	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
L29656	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	What's a real denial?
L29623	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--Deep Throat?--
L29622	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--and we got a guy in Justice--
L29619	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
L29618	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--no--
L29324	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
L29323	u3620	m239	HANNAH	You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
L29322	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	There's always a later plane.
L29321	u3620	m239	HANNAH	I thought you had to get to Miami.
L29320	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	It's right under that pile.
L29319	u3620	m239	HANNAH	Give me your checkbook then.
L29318	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I think.
L29317	u3620	m239	HANNAH	You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
L29316	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Five hundred; six maybe.
L29315	u3620	m239	HANNAH	Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
L29314	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Hey... very tense.
L29313	u3620	m239	HANNAH	Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
L29312	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
L29311	u3620	m239	HANNAH	Where are your bills, Carl?
L29310	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
L29414	u3623	m239	JANE	We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
L29413	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Hey, easy...
L29412	u3623	m239	JANE	I don't know what they'd do to me.
L29411	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
L29410	u3623	m239	JANE	You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
L29409	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	FBI too?
L29408	u3623	m239	JANE	This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
L29407	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--you don't really think you're being followed?
L29406	u3623	m239	JANE	Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
L29405	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
L29537	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
L29536	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
L29535	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Gordon Liddy, you mean?
L29534	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
L29533	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
L29530	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
L29529	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
L29528	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Who were they?
L29527	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	The ones who could disburse the money.
L29526	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Which people?
L29525	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
L29524	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
L29523	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
L29522	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
L29521	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
L29515	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
L29514	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	...No... never in so many words...
L29513	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
L29512	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
L29511	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	One minute but then--
L29508	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
L29507	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
L29506	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
L29505	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
L29504	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
L29503	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
L29502	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Just let me get a match.
L29501	u3612	m239	BOOKKEEPER	You've really got to go.
L29292	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
L29291	u3622	m239	IRWIN	A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
L29290	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Who by?
L29289	u3622	m239	IRWIN	It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
L29288	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Just tell me about the goddamn article.
L29287	u3622	m239	IRWIN	And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
L29286	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Something maybe big.
L29285	u3622	m239	IRWIN	My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
L29284	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	No games, Irwin; give.
L29283	u3622	m239	IRWIN	What do you want to know?
L29282	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	So tell me about the Times article.
L29281	u3622	m239	IRWIN	'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
L29280	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
L29865	u3633	m239	SLOAN	--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
L29864	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
L29861	u3633	m239	SLOAN	I'm not your source on that.
L29860	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--that leaves Haldeman, period.
L29857	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
L29856	u3633	m239	SLOAN	--I'm not your source on that--
L29849	u3633	m239	SLOAN	--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
L29848	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--this'll only take one second--
L29847	u3633	m239	SLOAN	I really can't talk now--
L29606	u3633	m239	SLOAN	We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
L29605	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	What happens when the baby comes?
L29604	u3633	m239	SLOAN	"Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say ""go ahead, give out the money."""
L29603	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
L29600	u3633	m239	SLOAN	Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
L29599	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Right.
L29595	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
L29594	u3633	m239	SLOAN	I will not talk about the other two.
L29593	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	But they both worked at the White House?
L29579	u3633	m239	SLOAN	Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
L29578	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	To cover up?
L29577	u3633	m239	SLOAN	"We were never told flat out ""Don't talk."" But the message was clear."
L29576	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
L29575	u3633	m239	SLOAN	That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
L29574	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
L29573	u3633	m239	SLOAN	Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
L29572	u3633	m239	SLOAN	--they're worse. That's why I quit.
L29571	u3611	m239	BERNSTEIN	--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
L29934	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	My non-denial denial.
L29933	u3632	m239	SIMONS	What's this?
L29898	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--you double-checked both sources?--
L29897	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
L29889	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
L29888	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
L29655	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
L29654	u3632	m239	SIMONS	Same kind of crap--
L29391	u3632	m239	SIMONS	And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
L29390	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	Then it's our asses, isn't it?
L29401	u3619	m239	FOREIGN EDITOR	The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
L29400	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
L29399	u3619	m239	FOREIGN EDITOR	Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
L29398	u3619	m239	FOREIGN EDITOR	Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
L29397	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
L29394	u3619	m239	FOREIGN EDITOR	It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
L29393	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	Go on.
L29392	u3619	m239	FOREIGN EDITOR	I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
L29958	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
L29957	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	Anything else from Mr. Throat?
L29954	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Electronic surveillance.
L29953	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	We can't talk inside either?
L29903	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
L29902	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I'm sure--
L29817	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--he went to her apartment and he told her--
L29816	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	--what do you think?--
L29815	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--his dialing finger must be falling off--
L29814	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	I got Clawsen on hold--
L29625	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
L29624	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I saw him. He verifies.
L29611	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
L29610	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
L29249	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
L29248	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I don't know titles.
L29247	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	Just tell me his title.
L29246	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You asking me to disclose my source?
L29245	u3613	m239	BRADLEE	How senior?
L29244	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
L29078	u3614	m239	CADDY	You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
L29077	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I have nothing more to say.
L29076	u3614	m239	CADDY	Are you implying you don't believe me?
L29075	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
L29074	u3614	m239	CADDY	Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
L29073	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
L29072	u3614	m239	CADDY	--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
L29071	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You're a lawyer and you're here--
L29070	u3614	m239	CADDY	They are not my clients.
L29069	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
L29068	u3614	m239	CADDY	There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
L29067	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
L29066	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
L29065	u3614	m239	CADDY	So?
L29064	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
L29063	u3614	m239	CADDY	I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
L29062	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What I don't understand is how you got here.
L29061	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
L29060	u3614	m239	CADDY	Look, I told you inside--
L29059	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
L29058	u3614	m239	CADDY	Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
L29057	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	"Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, ""I'm not here,"" Mr. Caddy said."
L29056	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	OK.
L29055	u3614	m239	CADDY	--I'm not here.
L29054	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
L29807	u3615	m239	CLAWSEN	--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
L29806	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
L29805	u3615	m239	CLAWSEN	Where?  What do you mean, where?
L29804	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
L29803	u3615	m239	CLAWSEN	That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
L29802	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
L29801	u3615	m239	CLAWSEN	Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
L29800	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
L29372	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
L29371	u3616	m239	DAHLBERG	I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
L29370	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
L29369	u3616	m239	DAHLBERG	That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
L29368	u3616	m239	DAHLBERG	I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
L29367	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Yes, sir.
L29366	u3616	m239	DAHLBERG	...you're definitely doing a story...?
L29365	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
L29364	u3616	m239	DAHLBERG	...check...?
L29363	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
L29946	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
L29945	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
L29944	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
L29943	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
L29790	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
L29789	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
L29788	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
L29787	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	And Justice and FBI know all this?
L29786	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
L29785	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	How grand?
L29784	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
L29783	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
L29782	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
L29781	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	There were more then.
L29780	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
L29779	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Talk about Segretti--
L29778	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
L29777	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
L29776	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
L29775	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Haldeman too?
L29774	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
L29773	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Mitchell knew then.
L29772	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
L29771	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
L29770	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
L29769	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
L29768	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
L29765	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
L29764	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What?
L29763	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
L29762	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	You'll have to find that out, won't you.
L29761	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Who?--be specific. How high up?
L29760	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
L29759	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
L29758	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
L29757	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Ratfucking.
L29756	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
L29269	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	"Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, ""What's the trick?"" And he replied. ""The trick is not minding."""
L29268	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
L29267	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
L29266	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What's the whole thing about--do you know?
L29265	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
L29264	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
L29263	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
L29262	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
L29261	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Go on.
L29260	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	To where?
L29259	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Follow the money. Always follow the money.
L29258	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
L29257	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
L29256	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
L29255	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
L29254	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
L29253	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
L29252	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
L29251	u3618	m239	DEEP THROAT	I saw the flag signal--what's up?
L29146	u3621	m239	HUNT	Good God!
L29145	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
L29144	u3621	m239	HUNT	--yes, yes, what is it?
L29143	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
L29142	u3621	m239	HUNT	Howard Hunt here.
L29141	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
L29093	u3625	m239	MCCORD	The C.I.A.
L29092	u3624	m239	JUDGE	Where?
L29091	u3625	m239	MCCORD	...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
L29090	u3624	m239	JUDGE	Where in government?
L29089	u3625	m239	MCCORD	Government. Recently retired.
L29088	u3624	m239	JUDGE	Where?
L29087	u3625	m239	MCCORD	Security consultant.
L29086	u3624	m239	JUDGE	And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
L29085	u3624	m239	JUDGE	Will you step forward, sir. 
L29084	u3625	m239	MCCORD	James McCord.
L29083	u3624	m239	JUDGE	Your name, please.
L29683	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Nobody ever had too much.
L29682	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
L29680	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	I really want to know.
L29679	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
L29678	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
L29677	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It is.
L29676	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	But it's possible.
L29675	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I couldn't say.
L29674	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
L29673	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
L29672	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
L29671	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	It may never come out.
L29670	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
L29669	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	No.
L29668	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	Are you sure?
L29667	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I think so.
L29666	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	"You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said ""don't, don't"" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, ""Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?""  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?"
L29665	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--I'm Woodward.
L29664	u3627	m239	MRS. GRAHAM	I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
L29389	u3628	m239	NATIONAL EDITOR	--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
L29388	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
L29387	u3628	m239	NATIONAL EDITOR	--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
L29386	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
L29385	u3628	m239	NATIONAL EDITOR	--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
L29384	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
L29381	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
L29380	u3628	m239	NATIONAL EDITOR	--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
L29379	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
L29621	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--well, Sloan--
L29620	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--who you got?--
L29160	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
L29159	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
L29158	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	So?
L29153	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
L29152	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Whaddya got, whaddya got?
L29140	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	"Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, ""When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."""
L29139	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
L29138	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
L29137	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
L29136	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Who's Colson, Harry?
L29135	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	"I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, ""I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"""
L29134	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Who's Charles Colson?
L29122	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
L29121	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Lotsa hints--
L29120	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	What'd you get on W.House?
L29119	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
L29118	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You can't believe that.
L29117	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	"Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  ""...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."""
L29116	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
L29115	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
L29114	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	I did all right on McCord.
L29113	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
L29107	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
L29106	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
L29105	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	...go on, go on...
L29048	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
L29047	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
L29046	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
L29045	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
L29044	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
L29932	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
L29931	u3632	m239	SIMONS	More denunciations?
L29896	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--maybe I'm tense--
L29895	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
L29894	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
L29891	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--go over your sources again--
L29890	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
L29615	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
L29614	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--has any of them got an ax?--
L29308	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
L29307	u3632	m239	SIMONS	I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
L29306	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	That was awhile ago.
L29305	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--remember Toronto, Harry.
L29304	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Howard--
L29303	u3632	m239	SIMONS	Anyone but Bernstein.
L29302	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	"I can predict the next words you're gonna say: ""anyone but Bernstein.""  I want to send a reporter to Miami."
L29112	u3632	m239	SIMONS	Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
L29111	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Could develop.
L29110	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
L29109	u3629	m239	ROSENFELD	Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
L29108	u3632	m239	SIMONS	Anything?
L29833	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	He just did.
L29832	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
L29831	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
L29828	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Larry Young, a California lawyer--
L29827	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--which Young?
L29663	u3632	m239	SIMONS	I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
L29662	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
L29661	u3632	m239	SIMONS	Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
L29660	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
L29617	u3632	m239	SIMONS	--can we use their names?--
L29616	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--no--
L29157	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Absolutely.
L29156	u3632	m239	SIMONS	Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
L29155	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	"According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  ""I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."""
L29154	u3632	m239	SIMONS	What else have you got?
L29863	u3633	m239	SLOAN	Of course--everything they asked--
L29862	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
L29859	u3633	m239	SLOAN	No, none of those.
L29858	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
L29851	u3633	m239	SLOAN	A girl. Melissa.
L29850	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	A boy or a girl?
L29602	u3633	m239	SLOAN	Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
L29601	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Go on.
L29598	u3633	m239	SLOAN	Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
L29597	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
L29596	u3633	m239	SLOAN	I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
L29592	u3633	m239	SLOAN	I won't talk about the other two.
L29591	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Haldeman.  Right?
L29590	u3633	m239	SLOAN	Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
L29586	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
L29585	u3633	m239	SLOAN	When so ordered.
L29584	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
L29583	u3633	m239	SLOAN	No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
L29582	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
L29581	u3633	m239	SLOAN	As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
L29580	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	"Does ""they"" mean the White House?"
L29570	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
L29569	u3633	m239	SLOAN	I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
L29566	u3633	m239	SLOAN	My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
L29565	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Mr. Sloan?
L29449	u3634	m239	SWEET OLD LADY	I'm not Miss Abbott.
L29448	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	You work there, Miss Abbott.
L29447	u3634	m239	SWEET OLD LADY	The what to what?
L29446	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
L29445	u3634	m239	SWEET OLD LADY	--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
L29444	u3635	m239	WOODWARD	Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
L86959	u4070	m270	LEE	Someday.
L86958	u4069	m270	BUCKY	He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
L86957	u4070	m270	LEE	He's half yours, partner.
L86956	u4069	m270	BUCKY	<i>You'll</i> take him.
L86955	u4070	m270	LEE	We'll take 'em in the morning.
L86954	u4069	m270	BUCKY	Whatta we do about the Mex?
L86953	u4070	m270	LEE	Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
L86952	u4069	m270	BUCKY	Impressive.
L86951	u4070	m270	LEE	Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
L86950	u4070	m270	LEE	I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
L86949	u4069	m270	BUCKY	You come all the way down here to roust--
L99031	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
L99030	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
L98958	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
L98957	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
L98956	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	And you believe the NLF?
L98955	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
L98952	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	No. It has failed in its objective.
L98951	u4145	m277	2ND JOURNALIST	The strike is a success; but ...
L98950	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
L99037	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	"And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences."
L99036	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
L99035	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	"Let's try to be precise then. The word ""torture"" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?"
L99034	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
L99033	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	I understand. What's your question?
L99032	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
L98966	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	It depends on you.
L98965	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	And here?
L98964	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
L98963	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Exactly.
L98962	u4146	m277	3RD JOURNALIST	Dien Bien Phu?
L98961	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
L98993	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
L98992	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Third group. What's your assignment?
L98991	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Third group.
L98990	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	"What ""group""?"
L98989	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
L98988	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Second district ... Explain better ...
L98987	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Second district ...
L98986	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	"Which ""district"" do you belong to?"
L98985	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Sail.
L98984	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Second name.
L98983	u4147	m277	ALGERIAN	Sid Ahmed.
L98982	u4159	m277	SERGEANT	Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
L98763	u4148	m277	ALI	You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
L98762	u4154	m277	HACENE	What ... What must I decide?
L98761	u4148	m277	ALI	They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
L98760	u4154	m277	HACENE	How much are they paying you?
L98757	u4148	m277	ALI	The NLF has condemned you to death.
L98756	u4154	m277	HACENE	What's happened to you?
L98755	u4148	m277	ALI	It's true.
L98754	u4154	m277	HACENE	Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
L98753	u4148	m277	ALI	Don't move, Hacene.
L98752	u4154	m277	HACENE	You afraid of these ...?
L99014	u4155	m277	KADER	No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
L99013	u4148	m277	ALI	No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
L99012	u4155	m277	KADER	Of course. As soon as possible.
L99011	u4148	m277	ALI	Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
L99010	u4155	m277	KADER	It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
L98904	u4155	m277	KADER	No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
L98903	u4148	m277	ALI	Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
L98733	u4155	m277	KADER	Not enough.
L98732	u4148	m277	ALI	And how many are we?
L98731	u4155	m277	KADER	Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
L98730	u4148	m277	ALI	You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
L98729	u4155	m277	KADER	Then don't complain.
L98728	u4148	m277	ALI	I don't do that kind of thing.
L98727	u4155	m277	KADER	C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
L98726	u4148	m277	ALI	What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
L98725	u4155	m277	KADER	You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
L98724	u4148	m277	ALI	But I haven't shot him.
L98723	u4155	m277	KADER	My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
L98722	u4148	m277	ALI	I don't even know your name yet ...
L98721	u4155	m277	KADER	Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
L98720	u4148	m277	ALI	Sure. By shooting at me.
L98719	u4155	m277	KADER	Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
L98718	u4155	m277	KADER	I'll explain.
L98717	u4148	m277	ALI	With an unloaded pistol?
L98829	u4148	m277	ALI	Go away.
L98828	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
L98827	u4148	m277	ALI	Where's Kader?
L98699	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	Here?
L98698	u4148	m277	ALI	Read it.
L98697	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	Sure ...
L98696	u4148	m277	ALI	Can you read?
L98690	u4158	m277	PETIT OMAR	Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
L98689	u4148	m277	ALI	Go away!
L98931	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
L98930	u4148	m277	ALI	To show them to the UN, right?
L98929	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
L98928	u4148	m277	ALI	Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
L98927	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Why?
L98926	u4148	m277	ALI	No, and neither were my men.
L98925	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
L98924	u4148	m277	ALI	No ...
L98923	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
L98922	u4148	m277	ALI	It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
L98921	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
L98920	u4148	m277	ALI	I think it'll be a success ...
L98919	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	What do you think of the strike, Ali?
L98916	u4148	m277	ALI	It's a question of habit ...
L98915	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	It's good nobody is following us ...
L98914	u4151	m277	BEN M'HIDI	Let's try ...
L98913	u4148	m277	ALI	Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
L98811	u4160	m277	SOLDIER	I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
L98810	u4149	m277	ARNAUD	Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
L98809	u4160	m277	SOLDIER	It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
L98808	u4149	m277	ARNAUD	But it's not even midnight yet!
L98807	u4160	m277	SOLDIER	It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
L98806	u4149	m277	ARNAUD	Good evening ... Can we pass?
L98794	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Good evening, sir.
L98793	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
L98792	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Rue de Th?bes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
L98791	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	Tell me ... Where is this rue de Th?bes?
L98790	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Good evening, sir.
L98789	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
L98771	u4152	m277	EMPLOYEE	Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
L98770	u4150	m277	ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER	Where were we?
L99127	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
L99126	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
L99123	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Let's hope forever.
L99122	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
L99121	u4153	m277	GENERAL	And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
L98891	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Yes, a name for the operation.
L98890	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	A name?
L98889	u4153	m277	GENERAL	Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
L99081	u4155	m277	KADER	She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
L99080	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	What is she saying?
L99079	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
L99078	u4155	m277	KADER	That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
L99077	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Of course I am.
L99076	u4155	m277	KADER	You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
L99075	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
L99074	u4155	m277	KADER	Why?
L99055	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Yes ... But let me first see you.
L99054	u4157	m277	MOURAD	Are you ready, colonel?
L99052	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
L99051	u4157	m277	MOURAD	We'll lower a basket from the window ...
L99050	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	How can I give you this statement?
L99049	u4157	m277	MOURAD	Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
L99047	u4157	m277	MOURAD	We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
L99046	u4156	m277	MATHIEU	Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
L99045	u4157	m277	MOURAD	Who is speaking?
L231299	u5463	m364	BA	I will follow you in all our vows and duties.
L231298	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life.
L231297	u5463	m364	BA	I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people.
L231296	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people.
L231200	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Eleven.
L231199	u5463	m364	BA	God gave you ten thumbs.
L230911	u5467	m364	GANDHI	There's no room! And the air is lovely.
L230910	u5463	m364	BA	Please! You're being foolish!
L230760	u5467	m364	GANDHI	All the more reason.
L230759	u5463	m364	BA	I am your wife.
L230758	u5467	m364	GANDHI	In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
L230757	u5463	m364	BA	It is the work of untouchables.
L230756	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Everyone takes his turn.
L230755	u5463	m364	BA	Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
L230686	u5463	m364	BA	Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
L230685	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Oww!
L230683	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Yes -- I can't talk like this.
L230682	u5463	m364	BA	Are you sure?
L230681	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- ""a monstrous attack."""
L230679	u5463	m364	BA	They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
L230678	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
L230671	u5463	m364	BA	As I told you about English policemen.
L230670	u5467	m364	GANDHI	A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest. -- I told you about English law.
L231568	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
L231567	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	Just an admirer...
L231565	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	One more.
L231564	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Enough.
L231560	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
L231559	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
L231432	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
L231431	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	What do you expect when you talk like that?
L231430	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No. That is what you get for distracting me.
L231429	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
L231428	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
L231427	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
L231423	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
L231422	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	...what shape it will take. Jinnah has -- what?
L231420	u5464	m364	BOURKE-WHITE	Stop!
L231419	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
L231021	u5467	m364	GANDHI	It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
L231020	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	"They're calling you ""Bapu."" I thought it meant father."
L231018	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
L231017	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
L231016	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
L231015	u5467	m364	GANDHI	If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
L231012	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Did they take your clothes?
L231011	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"Not quite. They're only ""holding me"" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison."
L230918	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Going nearer to God!
L230917	u5467	m364	GANDHI	What are you doing?
L230913	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
L230912	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	No violence, please.
L230727	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Well, we shall try.
L230726	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	"That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this ""farm""..."
L230724	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
L230723	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I thought you were a man of God.
L230722	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	That was lucky.
L230708	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
L230707	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
L230706	u5467	m364	GANDHI	You're a clergyman.
L230704	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Some of it good, I hope.
L230703	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
L230702	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm sorry.
L230701	u5465	m364	CHARLIE	You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
L231349	u5477	m364	WALKER	He said he's in charge...
L231348	u5466	m364	COLLINS	What'd he say?
L231292	u5466	m364	COLLINS	Well, he must've found some of the answers...
L231291	u5477	m364	WALKER	Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
L231290	u5466	m364	COLLINS	What was he like?
L231289	u5477	m364	WALKER	Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
L231288	u5466	m364	COLLINS	You mean Gandhi?
L231285	u5477	m364	WALKER	Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
L231284	u5466	m364	COLLINS	How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
L231283	u5477	m364	WALKER	...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
L230624	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No, no -- just a moment, please.
L230623	u5474	m364	PORTER	I'll take your luggage back, baas.
L230617	u5474	m364	PORTER	Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
L230616	u5467	m364	GANDHI	A -- a week.
L230615	u5474	m364	PORTER	Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
L230614	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
L230613	u5474	m364	PORTER	Hell!
L230612	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Tell me -- do you think about hell?
L231528	u5467	m364	GANDHI	That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
L231527	u5472	m364	NEHRU	What do you want?
L231400	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
L231399	u5467	m364	GANDHI	They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
L231341	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Wait and see... wait and see...
L231340	u5472	m364	NEHRU	He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
L231339	u5467	m364	GANDHI	And Jinnah?
L231266	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Panditji -- please, help me.
L231265	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
L231239	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
L231238	u5472	m364	NEHRU	It was one incident.
L231237	u5467	m364	GANDHI	If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
L231232	u5467	m364	GANDHI	We must end the campaign.
L231231	u5472	m364	NEHRU	What can we do?
L231115	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I've never spoken for anything else.
L231114	u5472	m364	NEHRU	The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
L231113	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
L231098	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
L231097	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
L230959	u5472	m364	NEHRU	I thought you were against fighting.
L230958	u5467	m364	GANDHI	We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
L231351	u5477	m364	WALKER	My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
L231350	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Are you going to walk all the way?
L231345	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
L231344	u5477	m364	WALKER	Is it over if they arrest you now?
L231343	u5477	m364	WALKER	It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
L231342	u5467	m364	GANDHI	You've done me a great service.
L231313	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
L231312	u5477	m364	WALKER	A great deal.
L231311	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Do you remember much of South Africa?
L231310	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
L231309	u5477	m364	WALKER	Hm.  Is it?
L231308	u5467	m364	GANDHI	And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
L231306	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Even as a boy I thought so.
L231305	u5477	m364	WALKER	It's beautiful.
L230748	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I hope not.
L230747	u5477	m364	WALKER	You're an ambitious man.
L230746	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"That's right. The word only means ""community."" But it could stand for ""village""... or the world."
L230745	u5477	m364	WALKER	"Well, it's quite a place, your ""ashram"" -- is that right?"
L230741	u5467	m364	GANDHI	There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
L230740	u5477	m364	WALKER	You will respect the law.
L230739	u5467	m364	GANDHI	"I don't know... I'm still searching for a ""response."""
L230738	u5477	m364	WALKER	"Hm. And what should an ""important professional"" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?"
L230737	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
L231550	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
L231549	u5467	m364	GANDHI	It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
L231336	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
L231335	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
L231252	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
L231251	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Do you find me stubborn?
L231220	u5467	m364	GANDHI	First spin. Let the others march for a time.
L231219	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	I would rather march.
L231218	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
L231217	u5471	m364	MIRABEHN	It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
L231451	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
L231450	u5469	m364	JINNAH	I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
L231234	u5467	m364	GANDHI	An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
L231233	u5469	m364	JINNAH	After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
L231092	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
L231091	u5469	m364	JINNAH	You mean a general strike?
L231070	u5469	m364	JINNAH	I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
L231069	u5467	m364	GANDHI	The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
L230886	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I --
L230885	u5469	m364	JINNAH	We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
L231492	u5467	m364	GANDHI	There is nothing I can give.
L231491	u5473	m364	PATEL	We need your help!
L231403	u5473	m364	PATEL	That's when you take advantage.
L231402	u5467	m364	GANDHI	They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
L231204	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
L231203	u5473	m364	PATEL	It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
L231076	u5473	m364	PATEL	Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
L231075	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
L230878	u5467	m364	GANDHI	No.
L230877	u5473	m364	PATEL	Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
L230876	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
L230875	u5473	m364	PATEL	I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
L230874	u5473	m364	PATEL	That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
L230873	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Who is that young man?
L230819	u5470	m364	KHAN	Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
L230818	u5467	m364	GANDHI	If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
L230817	u5470	m364	KHAN	Well, that's one victory.
L230816	u5467	m364	GANDHI	It's split the Government.
L230815	u5470	m364	KHAN	The fools!  Sorry...
L230814	u5467	m364	GANDHI	My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
L230813	u5470	m364	KHAN	I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
L230811	u5467	m364	GANDHI	So did I.
L230810	u5470	m364	KHAN	No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
L230809	u5467	m364	GANDHI	They're sparing no one, I see.
L230643	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
L230642	u5470	m364	KHAN	Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
L230641	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
L230640	u5470	m364	KHAN	"I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less ""holy"" than Mr. Baker."
L230639	u5467	m364	GANDHI	You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
L230634	u5470	m364	KHAN	That was England.
L230633	u5467	m364	GANDHI	In England, I was a poor student but I --
L230845	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
L230844	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
L230843	u5476	m364	SMUTS	All right. Fine.
L230842	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
L230841	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Assuming we are in agreement?
L230839	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
L230838	u5476	m364	SMUTS	You're an extraordinary man.
L230835	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I congratulate them.
L230834	u5476	m364	SMUTS	"Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to ""investigate"" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed."
L230833	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Very well.
L230832	u5476	m364	SMUTS	I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
L230831	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Somehow I expected not.
L230830	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
L230829	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
L230828	u5476	m364	SMUTS	"Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such ""exception"" to."
L230826	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Ahh.
L230825	u5467	m364	GANDHI	I dined at the prison.
L230824	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Perhaps some tea?
L230823	u5467	m364	GANDHI	Thank you. No.
L230822	u5476	m364	SMUTS	Will you have a glass of sherry?
L231377	u5468	m364	IRWIN	Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
L231376	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
L231375	u5468	m364	IRWIN	He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
L231369	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
L231368	u5468	m364	IRWIN	Who's leading them?
L231367	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
L231327	u5475	m364	SENIOR POLICE OFFICER	"Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of ""Free India."" Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt."
L231326	u5468	m364	IRWIN	"And that's the basis of this ""Declaration of Independence""?"
L231489	u5472	m364	NEHRU	Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
L231488	u5473	m364	PATEL	Could we cut all news off? I know --
L231485	u5473	m364	PATEL	...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
L231484	u5472	m364	NEHRU	In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
L231480	u5473	m364	PATEL	Have you found him?
L231479	u5472	m364	NEHRU	He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
L231468	u5473	m364	PATEL	If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
L231467	u5472	m364	NEHRU	Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
L230946	u5473	m364	PATEL	No -- but I think I'm going to.
L230945	u5472	m364	NEHRU	Have you read his magazine?
L230908	u5472	m364	NEHRU	"He's ""discovering"" India."
L230907	u5473	m364	PATEL	Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
L289047	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	A delegation.
L289046	u5909	m390	PAUL	We, who is we?
L289045	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
L288825	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
L288824	u5909	m390	PAUL	What happened?
L288440	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, it's a private function.
L288439	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
L288438	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
L288437	u5897	m390	BENEDICT	Paul, Paul, a moment please.
L288725	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll be back.
L288724	u5898	m390	BIK	Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
L288477	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288476	u5898	m390	BIK	Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
L288475	u5909	m390	PAUL	Leave it to me.
L288474	u5898	m390	BIK	The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
L288473	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me?
L288472	u5898	m390	BIK	That's what I came to talk to you about.
L288471	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
L288469	u5898	m390	BIK	Cockroaches?
L288468	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
L288419	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
L288418	u5898	m390	BIK	Paul!
L288729	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
L288728	u5909	m390	PAUL	Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
L288718	u5909	m390	PAUL	I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
L288717	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
L288716	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
L288715	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Give me it.
L288714	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
L288713	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	And four children?
L288712	u5909	m390	PAUL	Ten.
L288701	u5909	m390	PAUL	Six.
L288700	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	How many in your family?
L288699	u5909	m390	PAUL	Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
L288697	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't have that much.
L288696	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Ten thousand francs for each one.
L288695	u5909	m390	PAUL	Name a price.
L288694	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	How much?
L288693	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
L288692	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You want to pay me?
L288689	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	There is nothing to it.
L288688	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, I don't use guns.
L288686	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let me explain.
L288685	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
L288671	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Where is your family?
L288670	u5909	m390	PAUL	Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
L288669	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288668	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
L288667	u5909	m390	PAUL	I used to work at the Diplomat.
L288666	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. I work at the Mille Collines.
L288665	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
L288664	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
L288663	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
L288662	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Let me see your identity card.
L288661	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is this about?
L288660	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	We are looking for you.
L288659	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
L288658	u5899	m390	CAPTAIN	Who are you?
L288801	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
L288800	u5903	m390	GLORIA	What was the response?
L288799	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes we have.
L288798	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Have you requested re-enforcements?
L288797	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
L288796	u5903	m390	GLORIA	If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
L288795	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
L288794	u5903	m390	GLORIA	We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
L288793	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
L288792	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
L289294	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
L289293	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
L289292	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
L289291	u5909	m390	PAUL	I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
L289290	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
L289280	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
L289279	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is it?
L289276	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I can't, I don't have the men.
L289275	u5909	m390	PAUL	Will you protect us.
L289274	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
L289273	u5909	m390	PAUL	I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
L289272	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
L289271	u5909	m390	PAUL	They fired a rocket at us.
L288886	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	They're only taking the whites.
L288885	u5909	m390	PAUL	Their people?
L288884	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
L288883	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
L288882	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't understand.
L288881	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
L288880	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me, Colonel.
L288879	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
L288878	u5909	m390	PAUL	Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
L288877	u5909	m390	PAUL	Canadian Club?
L288876	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Anything. Strong.
L288830	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where is she?
L288829	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
L288828	u5909	m390	PAUL	What's happening?
L288827	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
L288804	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
L288803	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
L288802	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
L288782	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
L288781	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
L288780	u5900	m390	COLONEL OLIVER	Paul, you know who this is?
L289344	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will do nothing unless you help me now.
L289343	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You will tell them the truth.
L289342	u5909	m390	PAUL	You think they will believe you?
L289341	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I led no massacres.
L289340	u5909	m390	PAUL	Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
L289339	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I committed no war crimes.
L289338	u5909	m390	PAUL	If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
L289337	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You lie.
L289336	u5909	m390	PAUL	When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
L289335	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am on a list! What list?
L289334	u5909	m390	PAUL	The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
L289333	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	How so.
L289332	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are a marked man.
L289331	u5909	m390	PAUL	Listen, you need me.
L289330	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	We are better here.
L289328	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
L289327	u5909	m390	PAUL	I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
L289326	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
L289325	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
L289324	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
L289323	u5909	m390	PAUL	I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
L289322	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
L289321	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, sir.
L289320	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
L289319	u5909	m390	PAUL	No.
L289318	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You know what the Scottish call it?
L289313	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Today.
L289312	u5909	m390	PAUL	When?
L289311	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
L289310	u5909	m390	PAUL	What do you mean, General?
L289309	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
L289308	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are they going?
L289307	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
L289306	u5909	m390	PAUL	Your police are at the gate?
L289305	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Get in.
L289304	u5909	m390	PAUL	We must go to the Diplomat.
L289303	u5909	m390	PAUL	Bring back your policemen...
L289302	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I'll be over.
L289301	u5909	m390	PAUL	The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
L289300	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Whiskey?
L289299	u5909	m390	PAUL	General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
L289250	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
L289249	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
L289248	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
L289247	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Where are my supplies?
L289225	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
L289224	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	You said you had no whiskey.
L289223	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
L289041	u5909	m390	PAUL	I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
L289040	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
L289039	u5909	m390	PAUL	I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
L289038	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	I will see what I can do.
L289037	u5909	m390	PAUL	The front gate would be best, General.
L289036	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
L289035	u5909	m390	PAUL	?Well rewarded? Those were his words.
L289034	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	He did.
L289033	u5909	m390	PAUL	I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
L289032	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The police are very busy.
L289031	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
L289026	u5909	m390	PAUL	Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
L289025	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ?we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.? What do you think would have happened? No different.
L289024	u5909	m390	PAUL	'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
L289023	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The high command? Our high command?
L289022	u5909	m390	PAUL	The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
L289021	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	And what will they do with these satellites?
L289020	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
L289019	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Satellites?
L289018	u5909	m390	PAUL	Satellites.
L289017	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Watch everything? How? They are gone.
L289016	u5909	m390	PAUL	The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
L289015	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	What did they say?
L289014	u5909	m390	PAUL	A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
L289013	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	What did you overhear?
L289012	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
L289011	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
L289010	u5909	m390	PAUL	The United Nations are still here.
L289009	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
L289008	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
L288436	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
L288435	u5909	m390	PAUL	It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
L288434	u5901	m390	GENERAL BIZIMUNGU	Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
L289116	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Take the river road back. It is clear.
L289115	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let's go.
L289113	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Why not? We are half way there already.
L289112	u5909	m390	PAUL	) You cannot kill them all.
L289111	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
L289110	u5909	m390	PAUL	What do you mean George?
L289109	u5902	m390	GEORGE	No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
L289108	u5909	m390	PAUL	You have no whiskey?
L289107	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Beer yes, but no whiskey.
L289106	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
L289105	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
L288407	u5909	m390	PAUL	At least.
L288406	u5902	m390	GEORGE	A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
L288402	u5902	m390	GEORGE	I am always glad to see you Paul.
L288401	u5909	m390	PAUL	Very good.
L288400	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Business is good at the hotel?
L288399	u5909	m390	PAUL	Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
L288398	u5902	m390	GEORGE	Politics is power, Paul. And money.
L288397	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
L288914	u5903	m390	GLORIA	You?re drunk.
L288913	u5905	m390	JOCK	Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?

L288807	u5905	m390	JOCK	Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
L288806	u5903	m390	GLORIA	We?re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
L288805	u5905	m390	JOCK	For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
L288847	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank God.
L288846	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Very soon.
L288845	u5909	m390	PAUL	When will they be here?
L288844	u5903	m390	GLORIA	The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
L288580	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288579	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Good. I'd like to book a massage.
L288578	u5909	m390	PAUL	The fifth room is your broadcast room.
L288559	u5909	m390	PAUL	Just give me a moment to get your keys.
L288558	u5903	m390	GLORIA	Great, I really need a shower.
L289118	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	I saw the sign.
L289117	u5909	m390	PAUL	Are you sure this is the river road?
L289086	u5909	m390	PAUL	Just drive, Gregoire.
L289085	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	The fog is too heavy, sir.
L289084	u5909	m390	PAUL	For supplies, you drive.
L289083	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Where are we going, sir?
L289081	u5909	m390	PAUL	Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
L289080	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Please, except my humblest apologies...
L289079	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
L288779	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
L288778	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
L288777	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	I don't have to listen to you anymore.
L288776	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get out of this room and get back to work.
L288773	u5909	m390	PAUL	Gregoire, what are you doing here?
L288772	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	Mr. Manager.
L288566	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give me the phone.
L288565	u5904	m390	GREGOIRE	There are no more rooms.
L288911	u5905	m390	JOCK	Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
L288910	u5909	m390	PAUL	This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
L288909	u5905	m390	JOCK	I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
L288908	u5909	m390	PAUL	I would never do that.
L288907	u5905	m390	JOCK	Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
L288841	u5909	m390	PAUL	This goes out live?
L288840	u5905	m390	JOCK	Perfect timing.
L288584	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
L288583	u5905	m390	JOCK	Can we phone them in, Paul?
L288582	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
L288581	u5905	m390	JOCK	Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
L288555	u5905	m390	JOCK	Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
L288554	u5909	m390	PAUL	Promoted. House Manager.
L288553	u5905	m390	JOCK	They moved you from the Diplomat?
L288552	u5909	m390	PAUL	I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
L288551	u5905	m390	JOCK	Paul, how the hell are ya'?
L288975	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	I will remember that name.  Let's go.
L288974	u5909	m390	PAUL	Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
L288973	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Don't lie to me. What's your name?
L288972	u5909	m390	PAUL	Call, sir?
L288971	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Who did you call?
L288969	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
L288968	u5909	m390	PAUL	That will take time.
L288967	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
L288966	u5909	m390	PAUL	The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
L288965	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
L288928	u5909	m390	PAUL	I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
L288927	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	It's an order. Get everyone out now.
L288926	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why sir?
L288925	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	Everyone must leave the hotel now.
L288924	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, sir. What is wrong?
L288923	u5906	m390	LIEUTENANT	You are the manager?
L289351	u5909	m390	PAUL	They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
L289350	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
L289102	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	One thousand francs.
L289101	u5909	m390	PAUL	How much?
L289100	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
L289099	u5909	m390	PAUL	You have our cards.
L289098	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What cards?
L289097	u5909	m390	PAUL	Our cards, please.
L289096	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What?
L289095	u5909	m390	PAUL	Excuse me.
L289094	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	Show me your ID
L289093	u5909	m390	PAUL	He will be here.
L289092	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	The commander is not here.
L289091	u5909	m390	PAUL	We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
L289090	u5907	m390	MILITIAMAN #1	What do you want?
L289172	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will give you my house.
L289171	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
L289170	u5909	m390	PAUL	How do you know?
L289169	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
L289168	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
L289167	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
L288863	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
L288862	u5909	m390	PAUL	Was there blood?
L288767	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	I will see what I can do.
L288766	u5909	m390	PAUL	This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
L288765	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
L288764	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
L288763	u5909	m390	PAUL	I need a great favor.
L288762	u5908	m390	MR. GARINDI	Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
L289359	u5909	m390	PAUL	We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
L289358	u5915	m390	XAVIER	They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
L289286	u5909	m390	PAUL	They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
L289285	u5915	m390	XAVIER	This time the Militia will kill us.
L289003	u5909	m390	PAUL	Also, this is your bill for the last week.
L289002	u5915	m390	XAVIER	Pack the bags, we have to move.
L289001	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
L289000	u5915	m390	XAVIER	The third floor are low class rooms.
L288999	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm going to put you on the third floor.
L288998	u5915	m390	XAVIER	Move? Where to?
L288997	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm afraid you will have to move room.
L288784	u5909	m390	PAUL	Of course.
L288783	u5915	m390	XAVIER	I will need a suite.
L289371	u5909	m390	PAUL	Anais, it is so good to see you.
L289370	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Oh, my babies.
L289298	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to go to the Diplomat.
L289297	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What's wrong?
L289296	u5909	m390	PAUL	The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
L289267	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
L289266	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please do not talk like this.
L289265	u5909	m390	PAUL	Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
L289264	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What sort of plan?
L289263	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to have a plan.
L289261	u5909	m390	PAUL	We are almost out of everything.
L289260	u5914	m390	TATIANA	We are almost out of water.
L289213	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul! Then another voice.
L289212	u5909	m390	PAUL	I love you. Keep the children safe.
L289211	u5909	m390	PAUL	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
L289210	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Let me go. Children get off.
L289208	u5909	m390	PAUL	I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
L289207	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No! Sit down now.
L289206	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to stay.
L289204	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No.
L289203	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get on the truck, Tatiana.
L289202	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
L289192	u5909	m390	PAUL	We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
L289191	u5914	m390	TATIANA	A little longer, Paul?
L289166	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
L289165	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, please try one more time.
L289164	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have to get out of here Tatiana.
L289163	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I will not leave without the twins.
L289151	u5914	m390	TATIANA	A Volkswagen!
L289150	u5909	m390	PAUL	A Volkswagen.
L289149	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I want to know.
L289148	u5909	m390	PAUL	What does it matter.
L289147	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What sort of car?
L289146	u5909	m390	PAUL	A car.
L289145	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Tell me what it was.
L289144	u5909	m390	PAUL	It was substantial.
L289143	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
L289142	u5909	m390	PAUL	To be closer. So that I could marry you.
L289141	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Why?
L289140	u5909	m390	PAUL	I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
L289139	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What?
L289138	u5909	m390	PAUL	I had you transferred to Kigali.
L289137	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Yes.
L289136	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
L289135	u5914	m390	TATIANA	In Ruhengeri?
L289134	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have a confession. When we met...
L289132	u5909	m390	PAUL	A kiss.
L289131	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
L289130	u5909	m390	PAUL	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
L289129	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
L289078	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
L289077	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You cannot go alone.
L289076	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
L289075	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No, no.
L289074	u5909	m390	PAUL	To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
L289073	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Go out! Where?
L289072	u5909	m390	PAUL	I have to go out to get food.
L289070	u5909	m390	PAUL	We're running out of beer and other supplies.
L289069	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What's the matter?
L289068	u5909	m390	PAUL	Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
L289067	u5914	m390	TATIANA	So where is the lamb?
L289066	u5909	m390	PAUL	Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
L288936	u5909	m390	PAUL	Do as I say. I will be there soon.
L288935	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What for Paul.
L288934	u5909	m390	PAUL	Go to the roof now.
L288922	u5909	m390	PAUL	Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
L288921	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
L288920	u5909	m390	PAUL	What are you saying, Tatsi?
L288919	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You could leave, Paul.
L288897	u5909	m390	PAUL	I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
L288896	u5914	m390	TATIANA	But who is left?
L288895	u5909	m390	PAUL	Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
L288893	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have been abandoned.
L288892	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What about us?
L288891	u5909	m390	PAUL	They are being evacuated.
L288870	u5909	m390	PAUL	No. They are not dead. Stop this.
L288869	u5914	m390	TATIANA	My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
L288866	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please go back, bring the children to us.
L288865	u5909	m390	PAUL	This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
L288836	u5909	m390	PAUL	Give him time.
L288835	u5914	m390	TATIANA	He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
L288834	u5909	m390	PAUL	How can we help him.
L288833	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No, Odette says he's in shock.
L288832	u5909	m390	PAUL	Has Roger spoken yet?
L288761	u5909	m390	PAUL	I'll try.
L288760	u5914	m390	TATIANA	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
L288759	u5909	m390	PAUL	Any luck?
L288758	u5914	m390	TATIANA	It will do just fine.
L288757	u5909	m390	PAUL	This won't do.
L288746	u5909	m390	PAUL	Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
L288745	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
L288744	u5909	m390	PAUL	What!
L288743	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
L288742	u5909	m390	PAUL	Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
L288706	u5909	m390	PAUL	Get in.
L288705	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul, don't let them die.
L288655	u5909	m390	PAUL	Stay with the children.
L288654	u5914	m390	TATIANA	What is it, Paul.
L288640	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are you hurt, son?
L288639	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Oh, my God!
L288632	u5909	m390	PAUL	Dawn. Then they go.
L288631	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please, Paul, 'til first light.
L288630	u5909	m390	PAUL	They know you are Tutsi!
L288629	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
L288628	u5909	m390	PAUL	Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
L288627	u5914	m390	TATIANA	They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
L288626	u5909	m390	PAUL	Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
L288623	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I tried already. The phones do not work.
L288622	u5909	m390	PAUL	I sent them home. Go and call them.
L288621	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Where are Thomas and Fedens?
L288618	u5909	m390	PAUL	Murdered! By whom?
L288617	u5914	m390	TATIANA	The president has been murdered.
L288614	u5909	m390	PAUL	Jean Baptiste!
L288613	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
L288547	u5909	m390	PAUL	"Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think ""Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody."" Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment."
L288546	u5914	m390	TATIANA	They do not have your connections.
L288545	u5909	m390	PAUL	He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
L288544	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
L288543	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
L288542	u5914	m390	TATIANA	You could have asked for a favor.
L288541	u5909	m390	PAUL	I couldn't help.
L288540	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
L288536	u5914	m390	TATIANA	We must do something.
L288535	u5909	m390	PAUL	No.
L288533	u5909	m390	PAUL	Please, be quiet.
L288532	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
L288531	u5909	m390	PAUL	What?
L288530	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Do something.
L288509	u5909	m390	PAUL	Homework?
L288508	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
L288492	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Of course.
L288491	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let's have dinner first.
L288490	u5914	m390	TATIANA	He wants your wisdom.
L288489	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thomas wants advice?
L288483	u5914	m390	TATIANA	Yes, with Fedens and the children.
L288482	u5909	m390	PAUL	Your brother's here?
L288481	u5914	m390	TATIANA	I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
L288480	u5909	m390	PAUL	Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
L288983	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
L288982	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why?
L288981	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
L288980	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
L288979	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
L288818	u5909	m390	PAUL	There is one thing I need right away.
L288817	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
L288815	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
L288814	u5909	m390	PAUL	Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
L288813	u5913	m390	SABENA PRESIDENT	Can I have your name again?
L289236	u5916	m390	ZOZO	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
L289235	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is this about no water?
L289221	u5916	m390	ZOZO	As the trucks go.
L289220	u5909	m390	PAUL	When?
L289219	u5916	m390	ZOZO	I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
L289189	u5909	m390	PAUL	Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
L289188	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Thank you, sir.
L289187	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
L289030	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Many beers.
L289029	u5909	m390	PAUL	How much beer?
L289028	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
L289027	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where has all our beer gone?
L288962	u5916	m390	ZOZO	The lieutenant wants the register.
L288961	u5909	m390	PAUL	What are you doing?
L288918	u5909	m390	PAUL	Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
L288917	u5916	m390	ZOZO	What do we do with all these people?
L288812	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
L288811	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
L288771	u5909	m390	PAUL	What! Paul storms off.
L288770	u5916	m390	ZOZO	He has taken the presidential suite.
L288769	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
L288423	u5909	m390	PAUL	How dead?
L288422	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Twelve are dead.
L288411	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
L288410	u5909	m390	PAUL	Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
L288389	u5909	m390	PAUL	Many times.
L288388	u5916	m390	ZOZO	You have taken business class?
L288387	u5909	m390	PAUL	Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
L288386	u5916	m390	ZOZO	That is why they call it coach?
L288385	u5909	m390	PAUL	It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
L288384	u5916	m390	ZOZO	What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
L288383	u5909	m390	PAUL	You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
L288382	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
L288381	u5909	m390	PAUL	What's wrong?
L288380	u5916	m390	ZOZO	Rutaganda's place?
L288960	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
L288959	u5909	m390	PAUL	The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
L288958	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
L288957	u5909	m390	PAUL	Yes, thank you Mr. President.
L288956	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul, are you there?
L288953	u5909	m390	PAUL	Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
L288952	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	The staff and guests! How many?
L288951	u5909	m390	PAUL	The staff, the guests.
L288950	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	All. What do you mean all?
L288949	u5909	m390	PAUL	I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
L288948	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Out? Where are you going?
L288947	u5909	m390	PAUL	We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
L288946	u5910	m390	PRESIDENT	Paul. Are you alright?
L288527	u5912	m390	ROGER	On the street.
L288526	u5909	m390	PAUL	Where?
L288525	u5912	m390	ROGER	There are soldiers.
L288507	u5909	m390	PAUL	Who is this Simon?
L288506	u5912	m390	ROGER	Please, papa, I have a secret path.
L288505	u5909	m390	PAUL	No, I don't want you going on the street.
L288504	u5912	m390	ROGER	Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
L288503	u5909	m390	PAUL	Why the hurry, Roger?
L288502	u5909	m390	PAUL	Thank you, Roger.
L288501	u5912	m390	ROGER	For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
L288753	u5909	m390	PAUL	Go downstairs, I will help you.
L288752	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	I don't know.
L288751	u5909	m390	PAUL	What is his room number?
L288750	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
L288749	u5909	m390	PAUL	Can I help you?
L288748	u5911	m390	REFUGEE	Moses, Moses Seradungu.
L339238	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
L339237	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I worry about them.
L339236	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Khambas are wild men.
L339235	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
L339234	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Kham, Holiness.
L339233	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where are you from?
L339232	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Yes, Holiness.
L339231	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	All quiet?
L339226	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes. I am ready.
L339225	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	Please, come, Holiness.
L339224	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	A moment.
L339223	u6233	m417	BODYGUARD	We must go, Holiness.
L338850	u6234	m417	BOY	I know.
L338849	u6253	m417	WOMAN	"And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. ""The Protector."""
L338847	u6234	m417	BOY	No cried?
L338846	u6253	m417	WOMAN	You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
L338841	u6234	m417	BOY	Cow.
L338840	u6253	m417	WOMAN	Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
L338839	u6234	m417	BOY	Tell me.
L338838	u6253	m417	WOMAN	Again?
L338837	u6234	m417	BOY	Mama, my story.
L339333	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	No!
L339332	u6235	m417	FATHER	Goodbye, Kundun.
L339011	u6235	m417	FATHER	Hmmm.
L339010	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I free the prisoners?
L339009	u6235	m417	FATHER	I will buy them for you.
L339008	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Here. We'll collect them.
L339007	u6235	m417	FATHER	Where will you keep them?
L339006	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will you buy the sheep for me?
L339005	u6235	m417	FATHER	I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
L339004	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And you have horses? You love horses.
L339003	u6235	m417	FATHER	I do, now.
L338997	u6235	m417	FATHER	Are you? Of whom?
L338996	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, I am in charge.
L338995	u6235	m417	FATHER	No.
L338994	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I do anything I want?
L338993	u6235	m417	FATHER	Not the way to talk to people.
L338990	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	It is alright, Father.
L338989	u6235	m417	FATHER	I am sorry, Lhamo.
L339359	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	And we will begin with tearing it down.
L339358	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
L339357	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	I will not approve it.
L339356	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
L339355	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
L339354	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
L339353	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
L339352	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
L339351	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
L339350	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
L339349	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
L339348	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
L339347	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
L339346	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	Are you, General?
L339345	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
L339344	u6243	m417	LUKHANGWA	You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
L339343	u6236	m417	GENERAL CHIANG	You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
L339311	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
L339310	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Soon.
L339309	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
L339306	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	I have a copy for you.
L339305	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have.
L339304	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
L339303	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Thank you. Please sit.
L339302	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
L339301	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	General Chiang.
L339300	u6237	m417	GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU	Dalai Lama.
L339317	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
L339316	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
L339299	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Then, we shall meet.
L339298	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
L339297	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes.
L339296	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Holiness?
L339295	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Yes, but they say he did.
L339294	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
L339285	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Time to study.
L339284	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Yes.
L339281	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He is a capable man.
L339280	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
L339279	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
L339278	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	I am afraid.
L339277	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	With much bloodshed.
L339276	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
L339275	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	So, we must face China and all her might alone.
L339271	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
L339270	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And the United Nations? Surely?
L339268	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	All?
L339267	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
L339124	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	We did not.
L339123	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Did you receive the letter?
L339122	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	"The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the ""Chinese region of Tibet"". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it."
L339121	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
L339116	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	It is calm.
L339115	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Sera monks have surrendered?
L339114	u6238	m417	KASHAG MEMBER	He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
L338930	u6246	m417	MOTHER	We do not know.
L338929	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Who am I?
L338915	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
L338914	u6239	m417	LHAMO	This many?
L338913	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Two.
L338912	u6239	m417	LHAMO	How many?
L338911	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I will be back in a few days.
L338899	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I miss him too.
L338898	u6239	m417	LHAMO	I miss my brother.
L338897	u6246	m417	MOTHER	You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
L338896	u6239	m417	LHAMO	I pooped.
L338895	u6246	m417	MOTHER	At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
L338894	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Me. First break of day.
L338893	u6246	m417	MOTHER	"Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, ""His time has come."""
L338892	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Cow.
L338891	u6246	m417	MOTHER	He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
L338890	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Your father had been very sick.
L338863	u6239	m417	LHAMO	Far, far away.
L338862	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Oh, no. Where will he go?
L339049	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	Answer. 
L339048	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I need to squeeze this brain.
L339045	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
L339044	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
L339043	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
L339042	u6240	m417	LING RINPOCHE	I accept it. What is suffering?
L339041	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
L339014	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	Not until you are eighteen.
L339013	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am him.
L339012	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
L339002	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you have money?
L339001	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	What do you think?
L339000	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do I have money?
L338999	u6241	m417	LOBSANG	You could buy them.
L338998	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
L339431	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
L339430	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
L339424	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
L339423	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I will not go.
L339422	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
L339411	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The people will not allow it.
L339410	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	They will take Lhasa next.
L339400	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
L339399	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
L339398	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
L339397	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
L339396	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
L339395	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
L339394	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
L339393	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
L339390	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I had relinquished doubt.
L339389	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Did you ever doubt it?
L339325	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
L339324	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
L339323	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am scared.
L339321	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
L339320	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
L339319	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
L339318	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
L339283	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
L339282	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
L339274	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	In the Americas.
L339273	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is that?
L339272	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	"One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called ""El Salvador""."
L339169	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	"The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, ""The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming."" And then, the radio went dead."
L339168	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Has anyone died?
L339167	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
L339166	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What is the size of our army, now?
L339136	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
L339135	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Quite simple. Yes. Good.
L339134	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
L339133	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	America, we shall see.
L339132	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And, America?
L339131	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Britain chooses not to.
L339130	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Britain?
L339129	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
L339128	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Can India help us?
L339127	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
L339126	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
L339125	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
L339120	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
L339119	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Ask whatever you will.
L339118	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
L339107	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
L339106	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What can I do? I am only a boy.
L339098	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Look here!
L339097	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
L339086	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	When it is time.
L339085	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tell me.
L339084	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	He warned about the future of Tibet.
L339083	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
L339078	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	I do not know, Holiness.
L339077	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is Alsace?
L339076	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	It is an island. American territory.
L339075	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	In the Pacific Ocean.
L339065	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will we ever be in war?
L339064	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	No. This war is almost over.
L339063	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Will we be in this war?
L339062	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
L339061	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	No. Not very big.
L339060	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Is that big?
L339059	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	Roughly five thousand men.
L339058	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	How big is Tibet's army?
L339057	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Please.
L339056	u6242	m417	LORD CHAMBERLAIN	May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
L338869	u6244	m417	MAN	Thank you.
L338868	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
L338867	u6244	m417	MAN	We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
L338866	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Please, come in, so cold.
L338865	u6244	m417	MAN	Good day.
L338864	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Good day.
L339384	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Always.
L339383	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
L339382	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
L339381	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
L339380	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I leave tomorrow.
L339379	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
L339376	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
L339375	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
L339374	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
L339373	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
L339372	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
L339371	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
L339370	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
L339369	u6245	m417	MAO TSE TUNG	You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
L339427	u6246	m417	MOTHER	You decide.
L339426	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you think I must?
L339029	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
L339028	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You will always!
L339027	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Me?
L339026	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But you will always be here?
L339025	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
L339024	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
L339023	u6246	m417	MOTHER	Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
L339022	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	"Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is ""lavish"" and ""willful"". ""How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"""
L339021	u6246	m417	MOTHER	I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
L339264	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
L339263	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	What does the butter spot feel like?
L339262	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You decide.
L339261	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	True.
L339260	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What do you think?
L339259	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	Is that a true story, or pretend?
L339258	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
L339257	u6247	m417	NOBLE BOY	Does he have the spot?
L339256	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
L339219	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
L339218	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You have grown up very good.
L339217	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	We have.
L339216	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
L339215	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I will miss you.
L339214	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
L339212	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
L339211	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Am I running away?
L339210	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	No, Holiness.
L339209	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You will not come?
L339179	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
L339178	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, I have no experience.
L339177	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
L339176	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
L339175	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	The people want you made Dalai Lama.
L339096	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
L339095	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
L339080	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Ahh.
L339079	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This is Tibet. And this is China.
L339073	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Where is Poland?
L339072	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Ahh.
L339071	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	This is Britain.
L339069	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
L339068	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Yes.
L339067	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	The Chinese.
L339066	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	We have enemies.
L338986	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I would not know. Maybe.
L338985	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
L338984	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
L338983	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
L338982	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You cannot.
L338981	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
L338980	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
L338979	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I want to go down there.
L338975	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	As you say.
L338974	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Pretend.
L338973	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	It is a story, you decide.
L338972	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Is that true or pretend?
L338971	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
L338955	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
L338954	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	Things change, Kundun.
L338952	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I have smarter men.
L338951	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I have more men.
L338950	u6248	m417	NORBU THUNDRUP	I am braver.
L338949	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
L338948	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
L339201	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	It may not be your decision to make.
L339200	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	How could I ever leave?
L339199	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
L339198	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
L339197	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
L339196	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
L339195	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	We cannot.
L339194	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
L339193	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
L339192	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	I do.
L339191	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
L339190	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
L339188	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	Eliminate you.
L339187	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You, kill me?
L339186	u6249	m417	TAKSTER RINPOCHE	They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
L339185	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Tell me.
L339155	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
L339154	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
L339153	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	It is a difficult situation.
L339152	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
L339151	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	What would you do, Holiness?
L339150	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
L339113	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
L339112	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	Completely.
L339111	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	You are unharmed?
L339110	u6250	m417	TAKTRA RINPOCHE	It is possible, Holiness.
L339109	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
L339255	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	I see that.
L339254	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Like my mother.
L339253	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
L339252	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Much too young.
L339251	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	Too young?
L339250	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	No.
L339248	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Does he treat you fairly?
L339247	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
L339246	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Hmm.
L339245	u6252	m417	TIBETAN WOMAN	I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
L339244	u6251	m417	TENZIN GYATSO	Did you love your husband, before you married?
L367823	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
L367822	u6453	m429	ANNE	I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
L367821	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	There were two.  Not one.  But two.
L367763	u6453	m429	ANNE	We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
L367762	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
L367761	u6453	m429	ANNE	D'Artagnan.
L367760	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	My Queen...
L367512	u6453	m429	ANNE	Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
L367511	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
L367509	u6453	m429	ANNE	Nothing... Nothing.
L367508	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
L367507	u6453	m429	ANNE	If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
L367506	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
L367504	u6453	m429	ANNE	No, stay back!  Stay back!
L367503	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	What -- ?
L367502	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady...?
L367501	u6453	m429	ANNE	Oh God I -- Forgive me...
L367200	u6453	m429	ANNE	That is good.
L367199	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No, M'lady.
L367198	u6453	m429	ANNE	And you were not hurt?
L367197	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	God smiled upon us.
L367196	u6453	m429	ANNE	I understand you saved my son's life today.
L367195	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	M'lady...?
L367817	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
L367816	u6453	m429	ANNE	No, Louis!  No!
L367815	u6459	m429	LOUIS	D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
L367805	u6459	m429	LOUIS	He is nothing now.
L367804	u6453	m429	ANNE	He is your brother!
L367803	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What had you to do with this, Mother?
L367802	u6459	m429	LOUIS	My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
L367801	u6453	m429	ANNE	Louis, please -- !
L367704	u6453	m429	ANNE	Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
L367703	u6459	m429	LOUIS	It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
L367701	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
L367700	u6453	m429	ANNE	Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
L367699	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
L367698	u6453	m429	ANNE	He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
L367697	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
L367696	u6453	m429	ANNE	First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
L367695	u6459	m429	LOUIS	He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
L367694	u6453	m429	ANNE	I wish to discuss your brother.
L367693	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What is it, mother?
L367692	u6453	m429	ANNE	We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
L367691	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I am preparing for a ball!
L367690	u6453	m429	ANNE	May I speak with you?  Alone?
L367689	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Mother -- ?
L367782	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Shut up, knave!
L367781	u6459	m429	LOUIS	D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
L367736	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
L367735	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
L367734	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Wh-- Wha--
L367306	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
L367305	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
L367304	u6459	m429	LOUIS	How goes that favor I asked of you?
L367303	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Your Majesty...
L367138	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
L367137	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
L367136	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
L367135	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	How can I serve you in this?
L367134	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
L367133	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
L367132	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
L367131	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
L367848	u6455	m429	ATHOS	To the Bastille.  And death.
L367847	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Then to the Bastille.
L367843	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Perhaps he serves a different king.
L367842	u6455	m429	ATHOS	So what has changed?
L367841	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
L367840	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You're a fool!
L367839	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	He seeks redemption.
L367833	u6455	m429	ATHOS	We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
L367832	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Bloody hell...
L367712	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Hold your goblet with two fingers.
L367711	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
L367668	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
L367667	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But --
L367666	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
L367665	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Aramis, this will never --
L367620	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
L367619	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But --
L367618	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
L367617	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What you're asking is impossible!
L367616	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
L367615	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
L367614	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
L367613	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Where are you going?!
L367608	u6455	m429	ATHOS	All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
L367607	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
L367606	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Poor Phillippe!
L367597	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- but --
L367596	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
L367595	u6455	m429	ATHOS	We must stop him!
L367594	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
L367593	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Hang himself?!
L367592	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	About to hang himself, I should think.
L367591	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- what is he doing?
L367590	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Now.  You were saying?
L367589	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
L367588	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- what is Porthos doing?
L367587	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Go on.
L367586	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
L367585	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You grow fond of him.  That's good.
L367584	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
L367580	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
L367579	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Three days??!!
L367578	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Three days.
L367577	u6455	m429	ATHOS	In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
L367576	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You can do it.
L367575	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
L367574	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	More wine!!
L367573	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
L367572	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	How is he?
L367555	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Yes, and he has a choice!
L367554	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
L367553	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
L367552	u6455	m429	ATHOS	And people close to him, who --
L367551	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Those can be adopted --
L367550	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
L367549	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I have it all worked out.
L367548	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
L367497	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
L367496	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
L367495	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
L367494	u6455	m429	ATHOS	He who is not with us is against us.
L367493	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
L367492	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
L367491	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
L367490	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
L367489	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Tomorrow.
L367488	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Who is he, Aramis?
L367465	u6455	m429	ATHOS	His plight is obvious, isn't it?
L367464	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
L367463	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
L367427	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
L367426	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	A body.
L367425	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What is that?
L367424	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Come, we have a boat waiting.
L367423	u6455	m429	ATHOS	The Prison of Belle Sur.
L367422	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Soon enough.  Here we are.
L367421	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
L367419	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Making the key to the throne.
L367418	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What are they doing?
L367403	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I am with you!
L367402	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	It can.  I know the way.
L367399	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Replace the king.
L367398	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What do you propose to do?
L367393	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
L367392	u6455	m429	ATHOS	And some problems cannot be settled without one.
L367884	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
L367883	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
L367867	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	That doesn't matter now.
L367866	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
L367865	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
L367788	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
L367787	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Everyone back.
L367786	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Pull them back!
L367785	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	You can't do it.
L367784	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
L367416	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I know.  God go with you.
L367415	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
L367414	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
L367413	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
L367406	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
L367405	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
L367404	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No!  Stop --
L367391	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
L367390	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
L367107	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
L367106	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
L367105	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	A simple theological discussion.
L367879	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	He is right, d'Artagnan.
L367878	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
L367835	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
L367834	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
L367717	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
L367716	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
L367673	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The Queen Mother.  Anne.
L367672	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Who?
L367671	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
L367655	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
L367654	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	He's going to kill you, Aramis.
L367647	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Did she have tits like that?
L367646	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
L367645	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Aramis... These are... these are whores!
L367642	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Come on...
L367641	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
L367634	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Why didn't you say so?
L367633	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	We go someplace dangerous.
L367632	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	What use am I?
L367631	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Coming?
L367604	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Well... Well... Okay.
L367603	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
L367542	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
L367541	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	But why?
L367540	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
L367539	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
L367538	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	No, not Louis!
L367537	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
L367536	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
L367535	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
L367530	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	But I was on duty...
L367529	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
L367528	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
L367526	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
L367525	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
L367467	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
L367466	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	And why are you so glum?
L367397	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
L367396	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
L367395	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
L367394	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
L367386	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Catacombs.  Very holy.
L367385	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
L367384	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	It is also a place of burial.
L367383	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Mother of God!
L367382	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
L367381	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Where are we?
L367380	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
L367379	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Aramis... is this the way to hell?
L367102	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
L367101	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
L367098	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Forgiveness?
L367097	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Forgiveness.
L367096	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
L367095	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	There are more important things than tits.
L367094	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
L367093	u6454	m429	ARAMIS	Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
L367092	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
L367852	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
L367851	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	It worked!
L367846	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
L367845	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You are right.  But it is a trap.
L367844	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
L367838	u6455	m429	ATHOS	He lures us to capture.
L367837	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan.
L367670	u6455	m429	ATHOS	At a ball, everyone watches the King!
L367669	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	D'Artagnan, unready?
L367432	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
L367431	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What do we do now?
L367430	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
L367429	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Who does?
L367428	u6464	m429	PORTHOS	He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
L367232	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Raoul --
L367231	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
L367230	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
L367229	u6465	m429	RAOUL	It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
L367228	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
L367227	u6465	m429	RAOUL	I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
L367226	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Die?  What...?
L367225	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
L367224	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
L367223	u6465	m429	RAOUL	She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
L367222	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Michelle cannot possibly accept!
L367221	u6465	m429	RAOUL	We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
L367220	u6455	m429	ATHOS	But -- are you sure?
L367219	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
L367218	u6455	m429	ATHOS	That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
L367117	u6455	m429	ATHOS	She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
L367116	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
L367115	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Perhaps this will help.
L367114	u6465	m429	RAOUL	I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
L367113	u6455	m429	ATHOS	None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
L367112	u6465	m429	RAOUL	Do I look all right?
L367861	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
L367860	u6455	m429	ATHOS	He lies.  He is here to trap us.
L367779	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
L367778	u6455	m429	ATHOS	If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
L367410	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
L367409	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
L367408	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
L367407	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
L367353	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
L367352	u6455	m429	ATHOS	The King killed my son!
L367351	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
L367350	u6455	m429	ATHOS	To kill the king.
L367349	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Where are you going?
L367348	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, I beg you --
L367347	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Get out of my way.
L367346	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, please...!
L367246	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Save my son, d'Artagnan.
L367245	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
L367244	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You trust his character more than anyone else does.
L367243	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
L367242	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Oh my friend.
L367241	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I know.
L367240	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Raoul is everything to me.
L367239	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
L367238	u6455	m429	ATHOS	What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
L367237	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
L367236	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
L367235	u6455	m429	ATHOS	She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
L367234	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
L367233	u6455	m429	ATHOS	This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
L367216	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
L367215	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I heard your playing.
L367214	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
L367213	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
L367212	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
L367211	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
L367210	u6455	m429	ATHOS	You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
L367209	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Thanks, but not for me.
L367208	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
L367207	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It's been too long.
L367206	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Athos, my friend!
L367205	u6455	m429	ATHOS	D'Artagnan!
L367898	u6455	m429	ATHOS	D'Artagnan...
L367897	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
L367886	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
L367885	u6455	m429	ATHOS	One for all.  All for one.
L367856	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	How did you --
L367855	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe...?
L367731	u6455	m429	ATHOS	She will be at the ball.
L367730	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	The room of the King's favorite mistress?
L367663	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Your mother's.
L367662	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Whose rooms are those?
L367661	u6455	m429	ATHOS	These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
L367627	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Porthos told me.
L367626	u6455	m429	ATHOS	How did you know -- ?
L367625	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
L367624	u6455	m429	ATHOS	No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
L367623	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
L367611	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
L367610	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
L367569	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
L367568	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	What is that?
L367567	u6455	m429	ATHOS	It is something I have done -- or did not do.
L367566	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
L367565	u6455	m429	ATHOS	I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
L367564	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	What is its antidote?
L367563	u6455	m429	ATHOS	The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
L367562	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
L367561	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
L367560	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
L367559	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Recent hours have been a shock.
L367478	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Phillippe.  Rest now.
L367477	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
L367474	u6455	m429	ATHOS	And you never knew why?
L367473	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	"A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, ""What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?""  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting."
L367472	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Who came?
L367471	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
L367469	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	Just... water.
L367468	u6455	m429	ATHOS	Are you hungry?
L367820	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	There.
L367819	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Where is Michelle?
L367811	u6459	m429	LOUIS	They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
L367810	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
L367809	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Forgive?!
L367808	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
L367807	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Get out of my way.
L367806	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
L367799	u6459	m429	LOUIS	My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
L367798	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
L367797	u6459	m429	LOUIS	He is my brother.
L367796	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	... You knew you had a double?
L367795	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I was told this impostor was dead!
L367794	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Yes, your Majesty.
L367793	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
L367792	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It shall be done, your Majesty.
L367791	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
L367726	u6459	m429	LOUIS	... tired.  Must... lie down.
L367725	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty...?
L367681	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
L367680	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
L367523	u6459	m429	LOUIS	It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
L367522	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
L367297	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Thank you, your Majesty.
L367296	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I will consider it.  Now leave me.
L367295	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
L367294	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Silence!  I order you!
L367293	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	At least help Raoul.
L367292	u6459	m429	LOUIS	That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
L367291	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
L367290	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
L367289	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
L367288	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
L367287	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
L367286	u6459	m429	LOUIS	That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
L367285	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty has had many women --
L367284	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
L367283	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
L367282	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Betrothed?  I think not.
L367281	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
L367280	u6459	m429	LOUIS	A personal nature?
L367279	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
L367278	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
L367277	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
L367276	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
L367156	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
L367155	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
L367154	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
L367153	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
L367152	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I decided it this morning.
L367151	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
L367150	u6459	m429	LOUIS	What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
L367149	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Your Majesty...
L367893	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	I am unhurt --
L367892	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Phillippe!
L367881	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
L367880	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
L367771	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	I must insist, Sire.
L367770	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	... The ball... Continue.
L367769	u6456	m429	D'ARTAGNAN	Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
L367768	u6462	m429	PHILLIPPE	Continue.
L367187	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What was the end page?
L367186	u6457	m429	KEEPER	You've... memorized...?
L367185	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	"Two-thirty-seven:  ""... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."""
L367184	u6457	m429	KEEPER	... Two-thirty-seven.
L367183	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What number, on the first page?
L367182	u6457	m429	KEEPER	Eh?
L367181	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	What number did you tear out?
L367177	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	Thank you, Keeper.
L367176	u6457	m429	KEEPER	Food, moron.
L367085	u6460	m429	MAN IN THE IRON MASK	No, Keeper.
L367084	u6457	m429	KEEPER	You dead yet?
L367888	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Shoot them!  Shoot them!
L367887	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Magnificent valor...
L367875	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
L367874	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
L367831	u6459	m429	LOUIS	When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
L367830	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Out directing the search for the traitors.
L367829	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
L367373	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
L367372	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
L367371	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You may go, Lieutenant.
L367370	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
L367369	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
L367368	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
L367367	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Did they kill him?
L367366	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
L367365	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Yes, yes, go on.
L367364	u6458	m429	LIEUTENANT	I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
L367142	u6463	m429	PIERRE	What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
L367141	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Exactly why it should be given away.
L367140	u6463	m429	PIERRE	That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
L367139	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
L367130	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
L367129	u6463	m429	PIERRE	Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
L367128	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
L367127	u6463	m429	PIERRE	Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
L367126	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
L367517	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
L367516	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
L367515	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
L367378	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Oh Louis, Louis...
L367377	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
L367376	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
L367375	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Did you know... about Raoul?
L367363	u6459	m429	LOUIS	No, you may wait behind the screen.
L367362	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Shall I leave?
L367328	u6459	m429	LOUIS	If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
L367327	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Sire, I --
L367326	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You are beautiful.  You know you are.
L367324	u6459	m429	LOUIS	My dear, I've already done it.
L367323	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	You would do that, your Majesty?
L367322	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
L367321	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	I... we are humble people...
L367320	u6459	m429	LOUIS	This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
L367319	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	It's lovely.  It's just...
L367318	u6459	m429	LOUIS	The food doesn't please you?
L367317	u6459	m429	LOUIS	Enough of this, our dinner waits.
L367316	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Raoul... is in love...
L367315	u6459	m429	LOUIS	From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
L367314	u6459	m429	LOUIS	A letter.  May I see?
L367313	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	... Nothing.
L367312	u6459	m429	LOUIS	How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
L367311	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Sire!  I -- How did you --
L367169	u6459	m429	LOUIS	You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
L367168	u6461	m429	MICHELLE	Sire, I --
L367167	u6459	m429	LOUIS	I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
L396906	u6696	m446	BROWN	She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
L396905	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
L396904	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
L396903	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	It's what the maids are for.
L396902	u6696	m446	BROWN	I can't move to tidy.
L396901	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	The place is a mess.
L396900	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
L396899	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You should have someone look after you.
L396898	u6696	m446	BROWN	What do you take me for?
L396897	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Be careful who sees it.
L396896	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's a diary.
L396895	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	What's this?
L396815	u6696	m446	BROWN	Get out.  Out!
L396814	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
L396813	u6696	m446	BROWN	She means it.
L396812	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Aye.
L396811	u6696	m446	BROWN	My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
L396809	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
L396808	u6696	m446	BROWN	You know nothing about her!
L396807	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
L396806	u6696	m446	BROWN	You watch your tongue.
L396805	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
L396804	u6696	m446	BROWN	Oh, I'm much more than that.
L396803	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
L396802	u6696	m446	BROWN	I can't let her down now, Archie.
L396801	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She'll get over it.
L396800	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll be worried about me.
L396799	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
L396798	u6696	m446	BROWN	I've got my duties to attend to.
L396797	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You've got three broken ribs, man!
L396796	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm getting dressed.
L396795	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	What are you doing?!
L396794	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
L396793	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
L396792	u6696	m446	BROWN	And she sent no word down?
L396564	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
L396563	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
L396562	u6696	m446	BROWN	But I'm the only one she trusts.
L396561	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
L396560	u6696	m446	BROWN	The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
L396559	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	John, it's not your problem what she eats.
L396558	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, but will they?
L396557	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
L396556	u6696	m446	BROWN	One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
L396455	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
L396454	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
L396453	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	The good-looking one.
L396452	u6696	m446	BROWN	Which one of us is she flirting with?
L396451	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
L396450	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm not sure I do, Archie.
L396449	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You know what I mean.
L396448	u6696	m446	BROWN	What?
L396447	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
L396446	u6696	m446	BROWN	She loved him.
L396445	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
L396444	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's only grief makes her like she is.
L396443	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	She's hardly a full hamper herself.
L396442	u6696	m446	BROWN	If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
L396441	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	It's better than shovelling horse shit.
L396440	u6696	m446	BROWN	Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
L396439	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	That's pretty good for a ghillie.
L396438	u6696	m446	BROWN	Sixty.
L396437	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	How about yourself?
L396436	u6696	m446	BROWN	Not bad, not bad.
L396435	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Seventy a year.
L396434	u6696	m446	BROWN	How much?
L396433	u6696	m446	BROWN	I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
L396432	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
L396431	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	Not down south you don't.
L396430	u6696	m446	BROWN	I speak as I find, Archie.
L396429	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
L396428	u6696	m446	BROWN	I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
L396427	u6691	m446	ARCHIE	So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
L396426	u6696	m446	BROWN	So?
L396886	u6696	m446	BROWN	Kitchen and lower house.
L396885	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	Checked and locked, sir.
L396884	u6696	m446	BROWN	Louder, girl!
L396883	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	Checked and locked, sir.
L396511	u6696	m446	BROWN	You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
L396510	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	I hope to go up next year.
L396509	u6696	m446	BROWN	Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
L396508	u6692	m446	ASSISTANT DRESSER	Mary Taylor, sir.
L396507	u6696	m446	BROWN	What's your name?
L396781	u6696	m446	BROWN	Are you all right, Barney?
L396780	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Yeah.
L396779	u6696	m446	BROWN	Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
L396778	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Yeah.
L396777	u6696	m446	BROWN	Good man.  And is she all right?
L396776	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Yeah, yeah, I did.
L396775	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
L396774	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
L396773	u6693	m446	BARNEY	Mr Brown, sir --
L396772	u6696	m446	BROWN	Hey, Barney.
L396659	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Quite.
L396658	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
L396657	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I'm flattered you think so.
L396656	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
L396655	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	A situation?
L396654	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
L396653	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I see.
L396652	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
L396651	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Of course.
L396650	u6694	m446	BERTIE	My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
L396649	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
L396648	u6694	m446	BERTIE	No doubt you've heard the rumors.
L396647	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I don't think I've had that pleasure.
L396646	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
L396645	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
L396644	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
L396758	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Out of my way!
L396757	u6696	m446	BROWN	Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
L396756	u6694	m446	BERTIE	The future King!
L396755	u6696	m446	BROWN	Whom you address.
L396754	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Do you know who you address, sir?
L396753	u6696	m446	BROWN	I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
L396752	u6694	m446	BERTIE	What did you say?
L396751	u6696	m446	BROWN	Are you deaf as well as stupid?
L396750	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
L396749	u6696	m446	BROWN	She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
L396748	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Convey her a message.
L396747	u6696	m446	BROWN	She's busy.
L396746	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I wish to see my mother.
L396606	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
L396605	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's the Queen's decision.
L396604	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
L396603	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	And that is my last word on the matter.
L396602	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Mama...
L396601	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
L396600	u6694	m446	BERTIE	But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
L396599	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	It is quite late enough.
L396598	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
L396597	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
L396596	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
L396536	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
L396535	u6694	m446	BERTIE	If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
L396534	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
L396533	u6694	m446	BERTIE	Mother....
L396526	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
L396525	u6694	m446	BERTIE	It's so infernally cold in here.
L396524	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
L396523	u6694	m446	BERTIE	I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
L396522	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Gesture?
L396888	u6696	m446	BROWN	Back and upper corridors.
L396887	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	Checked and locked, sir.
L396690	u6696	m446	BROWN	You'll talk when I'm finished!
L396689	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	We --
L396688	u6696	m446	BROWN	What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
L396504	u6696	m446	BROWN	That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
L396503	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
L396502	u6696	m446	BROWN	My own.
L396501	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	By whose authority?
L396500	u6696	m446	BROWN	Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
L396499	u6695	m446	BERTIE'S VALET	Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
L396996	u6696	m446	BROWN	I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
L396995	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
L396702	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
L396701	u6696	m446	BROWN	Nobody has any rights over me.
L396700	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
L396699	u6696	m446	BROWN	This is a slur on her good name.
L396698	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
L396697	u6696	m446	BROWN	Don't think I can't persuade her.
L396696	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
L396695	u6696	m446	BROWN	If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
L396593	u6696	m446	BROWN	It can wait.  Anything else?
L396592	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	There are important papers from --
L396591	u6696	m446	BROWN	That can wait till the weekend.
L396590	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
L396589	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
L396478	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Yes, it most certainly is!
L396477	u6696	m446	BROWN	Is that the Queen's request?
L396476	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Go inside at once.
L396475	u6696	m446	BROWN	Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
L396474	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
L396473	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I beg your pardon?
L396472	u6696	m446	BROWN	No.
L396471	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
L396470	u6696	m446	BROWN	I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
L396469	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
L396468	u6696	m446	BROWN	Awaiting my orders.
L396403	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Yes.  I do.
L396402	u6696	m446	BROWN	Do you?
L396401	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
L396400	u6696	m446	BROWN	I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
L396399	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
L396398	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, do.
L396397	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
L396396	u6696	m446	BROWN	That's not good enough.
L396395	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
L396394	u6696	m446	BROWN	I need a man who knows where I am.
L396393	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Her Highness' Equerry.
L396392	u6696	m446	BROWN	Who'll bring it to me?
L396391	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	You'll be sent a message.
L396390	u6696	m446	BROWN	How will I know what she requires?
L396389	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I'm sorry?
L396388	u6696	m446	BROWN	How will I know?
L396387	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
L396956	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
L396955	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll think I betrayed her.
L396954	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	In time, she will.
L396953	u6696	m446	BROWN	She'll never understand it.
L396952	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	For once in my life, I am not the issue.
L396951	u6696	m446	BROWN	I promised to protect her from people like you.
L396950	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	No love.
L396949	u6696	m446	BROWN	No loyalty.
L396948	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The greasy pole.
L396947	u6696	m446	BROWN	Too busy looking after themselves.
L396946	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	They aren't as watchful as you.
L396945	u6696	m446	BROWN	The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
L396944	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	See what?
L396943	u6696	m446	BROWN	They don't see it.
L396942	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	She trusts you, John.
L396941	u6696	m446	BROWN	Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
L396940	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
L396939	u6696	m446	BROWN	So...?
L396938	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
L396937	u6696	m446	BROWN	Why do you think I keep her here?
L396936	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
L396934	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	No other aspiration?
L396933	u6696	m446	BROWN	I said.  I serve the Queen.
L396932	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	But yourself?  What about John Brown?
L396931	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye.
L396930	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	For Her Majesty.
L396929	u6696	m446	BROWN	I do what I do.
L396928	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
L396927	u6696	m446	BROWN	Why?
L396926	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Then I envy yo.
L396925	u6696	m446	BROWN	Maybe, once.
L396924	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Was there never ambition?
L396923	u6696	m446	BROWN	What I do, I do for my Queen.
L396922	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Surely --
L396921	u6696	m446	BROWN	I wouldn't know.
L396920	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
L396918	u6696	m446	BROWN	This is the top.
L396917	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Oh.
L396916	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm not married.
L396915	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
L396914	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's nothing.
L396913	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	You're injured.
L396912	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm fine.
L396911	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
L396910	u6696	m446	BROWN	I don't think about it.
L396909	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
L396908	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
L396907	u6696	m446	BROWN	You sent for me.
L396879	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Quite.
L396878	u6696	m446	BROWN	Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
L396876	u6696	m446	BROWN	If you hunt, you kill.
L396875	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
L396874	u6696	m446	BROWN	Dare say you can be taught.
L396873	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Occasionally.
L396872	u6696	m446	BROWN	Do you hunt?
L396871	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I am a blank sheet.
L396870	u6696	m446	BROWN	What do you know about the Highlands?
L396869	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
L396868	u6696	m446	BROWN	What brings you here?
L397018	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.  Yes it was.
L397017	u6696	m446	BROWN	Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
L397016	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
L396972	u6696	m446	BROWN	Because I have to! 
L396971	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then why send me back to them?!
L396970	u6696	m446	BROWN	-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
L396969	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
L396968	u6696	m446	BROWN	For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
L396967	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
L396966	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm breaking no promises!
L396965	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
L396964	u6696	m446	BROWN	Have I ever let you down before--?
L396963	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
L396962	u6696	m446	BROWN	If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
L396961	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
L396847	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
L396846	u6696	m446	BROWN	I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
L396845	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I do not accept.
L396844	u6696	m446	BROWN	Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
L396843	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes?
L396842	u6696	m446	BROWN	Ma'am?
L396841	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396840	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Has someone seen to those bruises?
L396839	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396838	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I was told you were in a fight.
L396837	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am?
L396836	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	John?
L396769	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
L396768	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
L396767	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
L396766	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Am I not safe enough with you, John?
L396765	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
L396764	u6696	m446	BROWN	I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
L396763	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Must they always follow us?
L396680	u6696	m446	BROWN	I heard something.
L396679	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is it, John?  John?
L396671	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye.
L396670	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	To keep out the cold.
L396669	u6696	m446	BROWN	We took a nip of whiskey.
L396615	u6696	m446	BROWN	Ah, well...
L396614	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
L396613	u6696	m446	BROWN	They're ready now.
L396585	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
L396584	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
L396583	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
L396582	u6696	m446	BROWN	Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
L396581	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
L396580	u6696	m446	BROWN	I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
L396579	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
L396578	u6696	m446	BROWN	That doesn't make him an expert.
L396577	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
L396576	u6696	m446	BROWN	What does he know about the Highlands?
L396575	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
L396574	u6696	m446	BROWN	Who by?
L396573	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I am told so.
L396572	u6696	m446	BROWN	Are they worth reading?
L396571	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	"I am thinking of publishing my ""Highland Journals."""
L396570	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
L396569	u6696	m446	BROWN	Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
L396568	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Those, over there, there.
L396567	u6696	m446	BROWN	What?
L396566	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What are those?
L396495	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.
L396494	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, ma'am.
L396493	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
L396492	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
L396491	u6696	m446	BROWN	If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
L396489	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	He thought so, yes.
L396488	u6696	m446	BROWN	It's a fine spot, ma'am.
L396487	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
L396486	u6696	m446	BROWN	And I intend to be there when she's ready.
L396485	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
L396484	u6696	m446	BROWN	Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
L396483	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then why do you persist in doing it?
L396482	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396481	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
L396480	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396479	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Mr Brown.
L396422	u6696	m446	BROWN	Yes, ma'am.
L396421	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.  That will be company for you.
L396420	u6696	m446	BROWN	Archie.
L396419	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
L396418	u6696	m446	BROWN	I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
L396417	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
L396416	u6696	m446	BROWN	I'm glad of it.
L396415	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
L396414	u6696	m446	BROWN	She's well, too.
L396413	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	And the pony?
L396412	u6696	m446	BROWN	I am.
L396411	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You are well?
L396410	u6696	m446	BROWN	Aye, ma'am.
L396409	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	You are here safely.
L396408	u6696	m446	BROWN	Ma'am.
L396407	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Mr Brown.
L396733	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Oh, several things.
L396732	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	What can we do?
L396725	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	I beg your pardon?
L396724	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
L396723	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	I came as quickly as I could.
L396722	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
L396721	u6697	m446	DEAN WELLSELLY	Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
L396867	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
L396866	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Yes.
L396865	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	This is my good John Brown.
L396863	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	No, ma'am.
L396862	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
L396861	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
L396860	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
L396859	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
L396858	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Is that not enough?
L396857	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
L396856	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then they may read about me.
L396854	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
L396853	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
L396720	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	"I was trying to imagine ""rather upset."""
L396719	u6703	m446	STANLEY	The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
L396718	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	What's her excuse this time?
L396717	u6703	m446	STANLEY	She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
L396716	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
L396715	u6703	m446	STANLEY	It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
L396714	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Mrs Brown.
L396713	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Who?
L396712	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
L396711	u6703	m446	STANLEY	You can't know that for sure.
L396710	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	We're going to lose.
L396662	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	To know when he'll be king.
L396661	u6703	m446	STANLEY	What did he want?
L396628	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	I hope he got his mother's permission.
L396627	u6703	m446	STANLEY	I see the Prince of Wales is here.
L396554	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	We'll see which way the wind blows.
L396553	u6703	m446	STANLEY	So?
L396552	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
L396551	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
L396550	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
L396549	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The question is, do we need her?
L396548	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Well, both.
L396547	u6698	m446	DISRAELI	The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
L396546	u6703	m446	STANLEY	Should we take it seriously?
L397035	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	No, indeed.
L397034	u6699	m446	JENNER	Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
L397033	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
L397032	u6699	m446	JENNER	Where did you find it by the way?
L397031	u6699	m446	JENNER	Of course.
L397030	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
L397029	u6699	m446	JENNER	Yes.
L397028	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
L397027	u6699	m446	JENNER	Dear oh dear.
L397026	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
L397025	u6699	m446	JENNER	A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
L397024	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Not too protracted, I hope.
L397023	u6699	m446	JENNER	Erysipelas.
L396675	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	No, she wasn't.
L396674	u6699	m446	JENNER	A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
L396375	u6699	m446	JENNER	Excellent!
L396374	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	A fine choice, sir.
L396988	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	How ill is he?
L396987	u6699	m446	JENNER	I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
L396986	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why was I not informed?
L396985	u6699	m446	JENNER	The same, your Majesty.
L396984	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
L396532	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
L396531	u6699	m446	JENNER	Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
L396530	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why am I being lectured in this way?!
L396529	u6699	m446	JENNER	Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
L396528	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Cold is good!
L396527	u6699	m446	JENNER	I'm sorry, ma'am?
L396383	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Whom?
L396382	u6699	m446	JENNER	We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
L397015	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why was I not told earlier?
L397014	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	A few days, ma'am.
L397013	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	How long has he been this sick?
L396790	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
L396789	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Has he been hurt?
L396788	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I understand he was in a fight.
L396787	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Unwell?
L396786	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
L396785	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why?
L396784	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
L396783	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Well?
L396462	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
L396461	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
L396460	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
L396459	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is he doing there?
L396458	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
L396381	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	Yes, ma'am.
L396380	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Just them?
L396379	u6700	m446	LADY ELY	The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
L396833	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Ma'am.
L396832	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
L396831	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Ma'am?
L396826	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
L396825	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What do they want?
L396824	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
L396823	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
L396822	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	From whom?
L396821	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I have a letter, ma'am.
L396820	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is it?
L396819	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	There is one other matter.
L396744	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
L396743	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Your Majesty --
L396742	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
L396741	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
L396740	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why not?
L396739	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I have no idea.
L396738	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Who told them that?
L396736	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Read it!
L396735	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Again?
L396734	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Read it.
L396668	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	And now I am back.
L396667	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	We were expecting you to return by six.
L396666	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
L396517	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	No.  I shall be out walking.
L396516	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
L396515	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why?
L396514	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
L396466	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	Of course, at once.
L396465	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Please make sure it does not happen again.
L396464	u6701	m446	PONSONBY	I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
L396463	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
L396983	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
L396982	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	What is the matter with him?
L396981	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
L396980	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Then why are you not with him?
L396979	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	He is sick, ma'am.
L396978	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Why is he not here?
L396977	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
L396976	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	Where is my son?
L396385	u6702	m446	PRINCESS ALEXANDRA	Yes, ma'am.
L396384	u6704	m446	VICTORIA	That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
L481462	u7399	m500	RAMN	There's nothing stopping you.
L481461	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
L481460	u7399	m500	RAMN	No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
L481459	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
L481448	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	That's none of their affair.
L481447	u7399	m500	RAMN	The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
L481446	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	No thanks.
L481445	u7399	m500	RAMN	You're welcome to one.
L481444	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
L481443	u7399	m500	RAMN	Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
L481362	u7399	m500	RAMN	Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
L481361	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	Why didn't you give a warning signal?
L481360	u7399	m500	RAMN	I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
L481871	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	I don't make policy.
L481870	u7403	m500	SHERIFF	Got any more ideas?
L481698	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
L481697	u7403	m500	SHERIFF	You want 'em all arrested?
L481696	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	You haven't tried locking them up!
L481695	u7403	m500	SHERIFF	I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
L481694	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	Well?
L481657	u7403	m500	SHERIFF	Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
L481656	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	Whose side are you on anyway?
L481655	u7403	m500	SHERIFF	Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
L481431	u7403	m500	SHERIFF	Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
L481430	u7391	m500	ALEXANDER	How's it going?
L481429	u7403	m500	SHERIFF	Mornin'.
L481749	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
L481748	u7399	m500	RAMN	What do you mean -- sex equality?
L481747	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
L481746	u7399	m500	RAMN	So? What does he want to do about 'em?
L481745	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
L481744	u7399	m500	RAMN	The woman question?
L481743	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
L481742	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	Yeah.
L481741	u7399	m500	RAMN	Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
L481740	u7399	m500	RAMN	It never ends.
L481739	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	How goes it?
L481591	u7399	m500	RAMN	You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
L481590	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
L481437	u7399	m500	RAMN	No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
L481436	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
L481435	u7399	m500	RAMN	Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
L481297	u7399	m500	RAMN	I say we gotta take action. Now.
L481296	u7392	m500	ANTONIO	Take a drink. Calm down!
L481365	u7393	m500	BARTON	You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
L481364	u7399	m500	RAMN	You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
L481363	u7393	m500	BARTON	I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
L481259	u7393	m500	BARTON	An American.
L481258	u7399	m500	RAMN	Who? A scab?
L481257	u7393	m500	BARTON	You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
L481256	u7399	m500	RAMN	Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
L481251	u7399	m500	RAMN	He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
L481250	u7393	m500	BARTON	Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
L481249	u7399	m500	RAMN	So much the better.
L481248	u7393	m500	BARTON	Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
L481247	u7399	m500	RAMN	You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
L481246	u7393	m500	BARTON	Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
L481319	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Yes. We will light the candles.
L481318	u7395	m500	ESTELLA	Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
L481317	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	They are singing for me.
L481316	u7395	m500	ESTELLA	Why are they singing, Mama?
L481261	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
L481260	u7395	m500	ESTELLA	Mama, can I put the candles ...
L481236	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Later. When I finish the ironing.
L481235	u7395	m500	ESTELLA	Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
L481234	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	No, Estellita.
L481233	u7395	m500	ESTELLA	Are you sick, Mama?
L481843	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
L481842	u7404	m500	TERESA	So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
L481772	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
L481771	u7404	m500	TERESA	It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
L481716	u7404	m500	TERESA	Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
L481715	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
L481351	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
L481350	u7404	m500	TERESA	Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
L481343	u7404	m500	TERESA	Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
L481342	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	To the mine?
L481861	u7399	m500	RAMN	This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
L481860	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	What are you saying?
L481859	u7399	m500	RAMN	This is what we've been waiting for.
L481839	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
L481838	u7399	m500	RAMN	Will you be still?
L481837	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
L481836	u7399	m500	RAMN	Shut up, you're talking crazy.
L481835	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	"Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. ""Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican"" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, ""Stay in your place."" Do you feel better having someone lower than you?"
L481834	u7399	m500	RAMN	You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
L481833	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
L481832	u7399	m500	RAMN	I don't know what you're talking about.
L481831	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
L481830	u7399	m500	RAMN	Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
L481829	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
L481828	u7399	m500	RAMN	Like what?
L481827	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
L481825	u7399	m500	RAMN	Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
L481824	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	You mean you're ready to give up?
L481823	u7399	m500	RAMN	Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
L481822	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
L481821	u7399	m500	RAMN	And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
L481820	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
L481819	u7399	m500	RAMN	Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
L481818	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
L481817	u7399	m500	RAMN	Why not? I'm not needed here.
L481816	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Ramn -- you can't.
L481815	u7399	m500	RAMN	No.
L481814	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Alone?
L481813	u7399	m500	RAMN	Sun up.
L481812	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	When?
L481811	u7399	m500	RAMN	Hunting.
L481810	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Where are you going?
L481808	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
L481807	u7399	m500	RAMN	We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
L481806	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Tell me.
L481805	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
L481804	u7399	m500	RAMN	Be still ...
L481803	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
L481802	u7399	m500	RAMN	You weren't waiting for me.
L481801	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I waited up till midnight.
L481776	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
L481775	u7399	m500	RAMN	A meeting?
L481774	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
L481773	u7399	m500	RAMN	We've got to have a talk, you and me.
L481770	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
L481769	u7399	m500	RAMN	But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
L481768	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
L481767	u7399	m500	RAMN	Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
L481764	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
L481763	u7399	m500	RAMN	Four nights. How did you sleep?
L481762	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
L481761	u7399	m500	RAMN	How do you feel?
L481685	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
L481684	u7399	m500	RAMN	I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
L481683	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I've had them since the day they were born.
L481682	u7399	m500	RAMN	You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
L481681	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I'm going back tomorrow.
L481680	u7399	m500	RAMN	I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
L481679	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Yes.
L481678	u7399	m500	RAMN	Must've been some experience for you, huh?
L481677	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Sure.
L481676	u7399	m500	RAMN	You all right?
L481649	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Backward.
L481648	u7399	m500	RAMN	Can be what?
L481647	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Anglo husbands can also be backward.
L481646	u7399	m500	RAMN	There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
L481645	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
L481644	u7399	m500	RAMN	She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
L481643	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
L481642	u7399	m500	RAMN	The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
L481641	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
L481640	u7399	m500	RAMN	No.
L481639	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
L481580	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
L481579	u7399	m500	RAMN	But it's yours. I won't let them ...
L481578	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
L481577	u7399	m500	RAMN	Over my dead body.
L481576	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Let them take it!
L481570	u7399	m500	RAMN	Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
L481569	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	What makes you so sure?
L481568	u7399	m500	RAMN	Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
L481567	u7399	m500	RAMN	I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
L481566	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	You are no good to me -- in jail.
L481565	u7399	m500	RAMN	They say I am no good to you.
L481564	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	What were they saying? About you? In there?
L481563	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	He'll have it good. Some day.
L481562	u7399	m500	RAMN	Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
L481561	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	He was born fighting. And born hungry.
L481560	u7399	m500	RAMN	A fighter, huh?
L481508	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
L481507	u7399	m500	RAMN	Mother of God ...have mercy ...
L481466	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
L481465	u7399	m500	RAMN	What's the matter?
L481327	u7399	m500	RAMN	I did forget. Lus told me.
L481326	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
L481325	u7399	m500	RAMN	Antonio paid for it.
L481324	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Was it expensive, the beer?
L481323	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	No, no ...
L481322	u7399	m500	RAMN	I'm a fool.
L481321	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
L481292	u7399	m500	RAMN	Aaah, what's the use?
L481291	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Never... never... never!
L481290	u7399	m500	RAMN	Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
L481289	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
L481288	u7399	m500	RAMN	Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
L481287	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
L481286	u7399	m500	RAMN	Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
L481285	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	What has it got me, your union?
L481284	u7399	m500	RAMN	Now don't start talking against the union again.
L481283	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
L481282	u7399	m500	RAMN	First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
L481281	u7399	m500	RAMN	The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
L481280	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	What's more important than sanitation?
L481279	u7399	m500	RAMN	We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
L481278	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	What?
L481277	u7399	m500	RAMN	We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
L481275	u7399	m500	RAMN	Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
L481274	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
L481273	u7399	m500	RAMN	Forget it.
L481272	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
L481271	u7399	m500	RAMN	This water's cold again.
L481270	u7399	m500	RAMN	Got to talk to the brothers.
L481269	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	Where you going?
L481267	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
L481266	u7399	m500	RAMN	But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
L481265	u7399	m500	RAMN	It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
L481264	u7394	m500	ESPERANZA	We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
L481553	u7400	m500	RUTH	Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
L481552	u7396	m500	FRANK	Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
L481551	u7400	m500	RUTH	Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
L481550	u7396	m500	FRANK	We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
L481400	u7400	m500	RUTH	"Or why don't you just put a sign outside? ""No dogs or women allowed!"""
L481399	u7396	m500	FRANK	But honey ...
L481398	u7400	m500	RUTH	Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
L481537	u7399	m500	RAMN	"Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, ""Who's that? His grandfather?"""
L481536	u7396	m500	FRANK	You know I don't think that.
L481535	u7399	m500	RAMN	Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
L481534	u7396	m500	FRANK	Go on. Spill it.
L481523	u7396	m500	FRANK	Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
L481522	u7399	m500	RAMN	Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
L481305	u7399	m500	RAMN	Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
L481304	u7396	m500	FRANK	"Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, ""Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."""
L481303	u7399	m500	RAMN	Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
L481302	u7396	m500	FRANK	Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
L481301	u7399	m500	RAMN	Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
L481457	u7397	m500	HARTWELL	Are we talking to a union spokesman?
L481456	u7399	m500	RAMN	It's possible. Just negotiate.
L481455	u7397	m500	HARTWELL	Well, if that's possible ...
L481454	u7399	m500	RAMN	Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
L481453	u7397	m500	HARTWELL	No ...
L481452	u7399	m500	RAMN	New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
L481451	u7397	m500	HARTWELL	No. New York.
L481450	u7399	m500	RAMN	You mean Delaware?
L481449	u7397	m500	HARTWELL	That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
L481758	u7399	m500	RAMN	You should have helped her without being asked.
L481757	u7398	m500	LUIS	But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
L481756	u7399	m500	RAMN	You've got to help around the house!
L481755	u7398	m500	LUIS	But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
L481754	u7399	m500	RAMN	Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
L481753	u7398	m500	LUIS	The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
L481752	u7399	m500	RAMN	The what!
L481751	u7398	m500	LUIS	Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
L481675	u7399	m500	RAMN	I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
L481674	u7398	m500	LUIS	Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
L481673	u7398	m500	LUIS	She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
L481672	u7399	m500	RAMN	Where's your mama?
L481470	u7398	m500	LUIS	Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
L481469	u7399	m500	RAMN	Lus! Come down here!
L481312	u7398	m500	LUIS	It's Mama's Saint's Day.
L481311	u7399	m500	RAMN	Forgot what?
L481310	u7398	m500	LUIS	I thought maybe you forgot...
L481309	u7399	m500	RAMN	What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
L481485	u7399	m500	RAMN	You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
L481484	u7402	m500	SEBASTIAN	I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
L481483	u7399	m500	RAMN	You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
L481482	u7402	m500	SEBASTIAN	My kids don't have enough to eat!
L481481	u7399	m500	RAMN	T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
L481480	u7402	m500	SEBASTIAN	Ramn -- listen my kids ...
L481479	u7399	m500	RAMN	You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
L481477	u7399	m500	RAMN	You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
L481476	u7402	m500	SEBASTIAN	Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
L481533	u7399	m500	RAMN	Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
L481532	u7401	m500	SAL	Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
L481531	u7399	m500	RAMN	He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
L481530	u7401	m500	SAL	You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
L481529	u7399	m500	RAMN	What attitude?
L481528	u7401	m500	SAL	And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
L481307	u7399	m500	RAMN	"Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? ""Pay -- or we take it away."" Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!"
L481306	u7401	m500	SAL	But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
L482833	u7423	m502	MILLER	Thank you, sir.
L482832	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Good luck, John.
L482828	u7423	m502	MILLER	The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
L482827	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
L482824	u7423	m502	MILLER	Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
L482823	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Spit it out, Captain.
L482822	u7423	m502	MILLER	But, sir...I...I...
L482821	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
L482820	u7423	m502	MILLER	A private, sir?
L482819	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
L482818	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sir?
L482817	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
L482816	u7423	m502	MILLER	Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
L482815	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Where are your men now?
L482814	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yes, sir.
L482813	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
L482812	u7423	m502	MILLER	They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
L482811	u7423	m502	MILLER	Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
L482810	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Casualties?
L482809	u7423	m502	MILLER	A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
L482808	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Resistance?
L482807	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
L482806	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	Report.
L482804	u7421	m502	COLONEL ANDERSON	...alright, let me know when.
L482803	u7423	m502	MILLER	Find a chaplain.
L483081	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Shit, that was no big deal.
L483080	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
L483064	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You take account of the wind?
L483063	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
L483062	u7428	m502	UPHAM	That must be four thousand yards.
L483061	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Not where I come from.
L483060	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You must be a hell a shot.
L483059	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yep.
L483058	u7428	m502	UPHAM	The Army gave you that?
L483057	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
L482992	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
L482991	u7422	m502	JACKSON	We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
L482990	u7428	m502	UPHAM	So they travel around from place to place and preach?
L482989	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
L482988	u7428	m502	UPHAM	No kidding.
L482987	u7422	m502	JACKSON	In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
L482986	u7428	m502	UPHAM	In West Fork?
L482985	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
L482981	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Figured.
L482980	u7428	m502	UPHAM	As a matter of fact, I am.
L482979	u7422	m502	JACKSON	You writin' a book or somethin'?
L482978	u7428	m502	UPHAM	So, where are you from?
L483541	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
L483540	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
L483539	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
L483533	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What deal?
L483532	u7422	m502	JACKSON	No kiddin'?
L483527	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Like hell, you did.
L483526	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
L483471	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Nope, he ain't Wade.
L483470	u7422	m502	JACKSON	He ain't Wade.
L483469	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I guess.
L483468	u7422	m502	JACKSON	He ain't half-bad, I guess.
L483467	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
L483466	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
L483465	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What do you think?
L483440	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Hell, no!
L483439	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
L483438	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Y'all come back.
L483393	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Of course, sir.
L483392	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yes, sir.
L483384	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Cap'n...?
L483383	u7424	m502	REIBEN	He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
L483360	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
L483359	u7422	m502	JACKSON	So, that's Ryan.
L483310	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
L483309	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
L483262	u7424	m502	REIBEN	The hell he didn't.
L483261	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
L483260	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
L483259	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Shut up, will you?
L483258	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
L483099	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
L483098	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Last I knew.
L483067	u7424	m502	REIBEN	They got squirrels there, too, right?
L483066	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
L483012	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
L483011	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
L483010	u7424	m502	REIBEN	If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
L483005	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
L483004	u7422	m502	JACKSON	You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
L483003	u7424	m502	REIBEN	No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
L482903	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
L482902	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Jackson?
L483549	u7422	m502	JACKSON	To each, his own.
L483548	u7423	m502	MILLER	It's worth it.
L483547	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
L483546	u7423	m502	MILLER	You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
L483545	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Say what, Cap'n?
L483544	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
L483356	u7423	m502	MILLER	Keep trying.
L483355	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Not yet.
L483308	u7423	m502	MILLER	Good, now get your goddamned gear.
L483307	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
L483306	u7423	m502	MILLER	You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
L483305	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
L483303	u7423	m502	MILLER	Who's Wade?
L483302	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
L483301	u7423	m502	MILLER	What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
L483252	u7423	m502	MILLER	Gives Wade the second shot.
L483251	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Watching.
L483191	u7423	m502	MILLER	They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
L483190	u7422	m502	JACKSON	We left them eighty-eights.
L483185	u7423	m502	MILLER	My guess, too.
L483184	u7422	m502	JACKSON	In the shadow by those two trees.
L483183	u7423	m502	MILLER	Where?
L483108	u7423	m502	MILLER	Wade?
L483107	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
L483106	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
L483104	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
L483103	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'd love to hear it.
L483102	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
L483009	u7422	m502	JACKSON	I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
L483008	u7423	m502	MILLER	You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
L483007	u7422	m502	JACKSON	Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
L482874	u7423	m502	MILLER	No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
L482873	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	Senator's son?
L482872	u7423	m502	MILLER	A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
L482869	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
L482868	u7423	m502	MILLER	How about that jeep?
L482867	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
L482866	u7423	m502	MILLER	A half-track, anything.
L482865	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
L482864	u7423	m502	MILLER	White-walls?
L482863	u7427	m502	SUPPLY SERGEANT	Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
L483529	u7423	m502	MILLER	I changed my mind.
L483528	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Captain, what about our deal?
L483525	u7423	m502	MILLER	I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
L483524	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What'd you say, Captain?
L483428	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
L483427	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Goddamn it, sir...
L483426	u7423	m502	MILLER	There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
L483425	u7428	m502	UPHAM	But, sir...
L483424	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
L483420	u7428	m502	UPHAM	The Germans do.
L483419	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, you got one?
L483418	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Would they notice and eighty-eight?
L483417	u7423	m502	MILLER	Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
L483416	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What about our grenades?
L483408	u7423	m502	MILLER	Those guns are close.
L483407	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
L483387	u7423	m502	MILLER	You don't count.
L483386	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
L483332	u7423	m502	MILLER	Same place we are.
L483331	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I wonder where they're going.
L483213	u7423	m502	MILLER	Plenty.
L483212	u7428	m502	UPHAM	That only leaves three.
L483211	u7423	m502	MILLER	What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
L483210	u7428	m502	UPHAM	The men said, nine.
L483209	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
L483208	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Good luck, Captain.
L483187	u7423	m502	MILLER	A machine gun.
L483186	u7428	m502	UPHAM	What is it?
L483181	u7423	m502	MILLER	Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
L483180	u7428	m502	UPHAM	No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
L483179	u7423	m502	MILLER	Did he see any sign of them?
L483178	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
L483175	u7423	m502	MILLER	I don't expect to live that long.
L483174	u7428	m502	UPHAM	If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
L483173	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
L483172	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Over three-hundred.
L483170	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Where are you from, Captain?
L483169	u7423	m502	MILLER	Some.
L483168	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You know classical music?
L483167	u7423	m502	MILLER	It seemed appropriate.
L483166	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I heard.
L483165	u7423	m502	MILLER	I've been humming it.
L483164	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
L483163	u7423	m502	MILLER	It looks like a Renoir.
L483151	u7423	m502	MILLER	You think the rest of us were?
L483150	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I wasn't made for this.
L483113	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sarge?
L483112	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Pass.
L483111	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham?
L483079	u7423	m502	MILLER	Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
L483078	u7428	m502	UPHAM	But you could have gotten killed and I...
L483077	u7423	m502	MILLER	It was nothing.
L483076	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
L483045	u7423	m502	MILLER	DASHES across the street.
L483044	u7428	m502	UPHAM	On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
L483043	u7423	m502	MILLER	Glad of it.
L482968	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
L482967	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
L482943	u7423	m502	MILLER	FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
L482942	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
L483435	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yes, sir.
L483434	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
L483423	u7423	m502	MILLER	Out of the mouth of babes.
L483422	u7426	m502	SARGE	Uh, oh.
L483413	u7423	m502	MILLER	We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
L483412	u7426	m502	SARGE	What are we going to do?
L483411	u7423	m502	MILLER	Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
L483410	u7426	m502	SARGE	What do you think?
L483405	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yes, sir.
L483404	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
L483296	u7423	m502	MILLER	But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
L483295	u7426	m502	SARGE	You're welcome, John.
L483294	u7423	m502	MILLER	Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
L483292	u7426	m502	SARGE	I'll do my best.
L483291	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
L483290	u7426	m502	SARGE	I know.
L483289	u7423	m502	MILLER	You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
L483288	u7426	m502	SARGE	Just what I want to do.
L483287	u7423	m502	MILLER	No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
L483286	u7426	m502	SARGE	You want me to take over?
L483285	u7423	m502	MILLER	I think you're right, Keith.
L483284	u7426	m502	SARGE	John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
L483283	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
L483282	u7426	m502	SARGE	Except this time, the mission IS a man.
L483281	u7423	m502	MILLER	Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
L483280	u7426	m502	SARGE	And how do you bluff yourself?
L483279	u7423	m502	MILLER	Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
L483278	u7426	m502	SARGE	Oh, yeah?
L483277	u7423	m502	MILLER	It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
L483276	u7423	m502	MILLER	No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
L483275	u7426	m502	SARGE	And what about your own hand?
L483274	u7423	m502	MILLER	She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
L483273	u7426	m502	SARGE	Bits and pieces.
L483272	u7423	m502	MILLER	You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
L483271	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yeah.
L483270	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
L483269	u7426	m502	SARGE	Vecchio.
L483268	u7423	m502	MILLER	What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
L483266	u7423	m502	MILLER	Let's just find someplace.
L483265	u7426	m502	SARGE	You alright?
L483247	u7423	m502	MILLER	Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
L483246	u7426	m502	SARGE	Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
L483245	u7423	m502	MILLER	More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
L483244	u7423	m502	MILLER	SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
L483238	u7423	m502	MILLER	About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
L483237	u7426	m502	SARGE	Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
L483231	u7423	m502	MILLER	Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
L483230	u7426	m502	SARGE	HOLD YOUR FIRE!
L483206	u7423	m502	MILLER	How about you shut up and take your position?
L483205	u7426	m502	SARGE	How about...?
L483204	u7423	m502	MILLER	How about you take your position?
L483203	u7426	m502	SARGE	How about I go right, sir?
L483202	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
L483161	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'll be alright.
L483160	u7426	m502	SARGE	You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
L483159	u7423	m502	MILLER	No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
L483158	u7426	m502	SARGE	Is it getting worse?
L483157	u7423	m502	MILLER	A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
L483149	u7423	m502	MILLER	It doesn't take this.
L483148	u7426	m502	SARGE	Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
L483146	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yup, hell of a mission.
L483145	u7423	m502	MILLER	Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
L483144	u7426	m502	SARGE	I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
L483143	u7423	m502	MILLER	You never know.
L483142	u7426	m502	SARGE	You're kidding yourself.
L483141	u7423	m502	MILLER	If we stayed, we could make a difference.
L483140	u7426	m502	SARGE	Three for three.
L483139	u7423	m502	MILLER	Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
L483138	u7426	m502	SARGE	Nope.
L483137	u7423	m502	MILLER	They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
L483136	u7426	m502	SARGE	And what about you?
L483135	u7423	m502	MILLER	They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
L483134	u7426	m502	SARGE	You think they'll be alright?
L483133	u7426	m502	SARGE	Good news?
L483132	u7423	m502	MILLER	Nope.
L483131	u7426	m502	SARGE	You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
L483130	u7423	m502	MILLER	Since when have things been normal?
L483129	u7426	m502	SARGE	It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
L483128	u7423	m502	MILLER	Maybe.
L483127	u7426	m502	SARGE	You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
L482975	u7423	m502	MILLER	Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
L482974	u7426	m502	SARGE	He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
L482971	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's not what we're here for.
L482970	u7426	m502	SARGE	Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
L482946	u7426	m502	SARGE	Uh, Captain...
L482945	u7423	m502	MILLER	PUSH!
L482944	u7426	m502	SARGE	Uh, Captain...
L482900	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yep, hell of a mission.
L482899	u7426	m502	SARGE	Hell of a mission.
L482898	u7423	m502	MILLER	A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
L482895	u7423	m502	MILLER	Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.
L482894	u7426	m502	SARGE	We in radio contact with anybody up there?
L482893	u7423	m502	MILLER	Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
L482860	u7423	m502	MILLER	I've got a line on one.
L482859	u7426	m502	SARGE	You get a translator, Captain?
L482849	u7426	m502	SARGE	Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
L482848	u7423	m502	MILLER	What about Talbot?
L482847	u7426	m502	SARGE	Fresh out.
L482846	u7423	m502	MILLER	Okay, Wade.  Translators?
L482845	u7426	m502	SARGE	Beasley's dead.
L482844	u7423	m502	MILLER	I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
L482843	u7426	m502	SARGE	Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
L482842	u7423	m502	MILLER	Simpson.
L482841	u7426	m502	SARGE	What about the company?
L482840	u7423	m502	MILLER	Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
L482839	u7426	m502	SARGE	You?  Leading a squad?
L482838	u7423	m502	MILLER	I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
L482837	u7426	m502	SARGE	Caen?
L482761	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
L482760	u7426	m502	SARGE	You tryin' to get yourself killed?
L482759	u7423	m502	MILLER	Worked, didn't it?
L482753	u7423	m502	MILLER	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
L482752	u7426	m502	SARGE	CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
L482748	u7426	m502	SARGE	Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
L482747	u7423	m502	MILLER	GO!
L483587	u7424	m502	REIBEN	More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
L483586	u7423	m502	MILLER	Goddamn it!
L483567	u7423	m502	MILLER	Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
L483566	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
L483555	u7423	m502	MILLER	FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
L483554	u7424	m502	REIBEN	FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
L483553	u7423	m502	MILLER	Here they come.
L483552	u7423	m502	MILLER	Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
L483537	u7424	m502	REIBEN	That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
L483536	u7423	m502	MILLER	I wonder if his cabin is still available?
L483531	u7423	m502	MILLER	I coach the baseball team, too.
L483530	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What deal?
L483517	u7423	m502	MILLER	Get back to your positions!
L483516	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
L483483	u7424	m502	REIBEN	OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
L483482	u7423	m502	MILLER	HERE THEY COME!
L483481	u7423	m502	MILLER	Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
L483430	u7423	m502	MILLER	See to it.
L483429	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
L483415	u7423	m502	MILLER	Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
L483414	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Maybe Caen.
L483391	u7423	m502	MILLER	You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
L483390	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
L483346	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Have it your way, Captain.
L483345	u7423	m502	MILLER	You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
L483344	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What if our guys open up, sir?
L483343	u7423	m502	MILLER	I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
L483339	u7423	m502	MILLER	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
L483338	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
L483334	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
L483333	u7423	m502	MILLER	Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
L483322	u7423	m502	MILLER	That's a mystery to me.
L483321	u7424	m502	REIBEN	No, sir.
L483320	u7423	m502	MILLER	Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
L483319	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
L483318	u7423	m502	MILLER	But we accomplish the mission.
L483317	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
L483316	u7423	m502	MILLER	I don't like that one.
L483315	u7424	m502	REIBEN	B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
L483314	u7423	m502	MILLER	Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
L483313	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
L483312	u7423	m502	MILLER	Why's that?
L483311	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
L483300	u7423	m502	MILLER	Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
L483299	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
L483298	u7423	m502	MILLER	Up.  We're moving out.
L483255	u7423	m502	MILLER	Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
L483254	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
L483189	u7423	m502	MILLER	We can't leave it here.
L483188	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
L483125	u7423	m502	MILLER	I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
L483124	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
L483123	u7423	m502	MILLER	Any further thoughts on the subject?
L483121	u7423	m502	MILLER	But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
L483120	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
L483119	u7423	m502	MILLER	In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
L483117	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
L483116	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
L483101	u7423	m502	MILLER	You have orders, too.
L483100	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
L483095	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
L483094	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
L483093	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
L483092	u7423	m502	MILLER	Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
L483091	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Huh?
L483090	u7423	m502	MILLER	Ours is not to reason why.
L483089	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
L483088	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, what do you want to know?
L483087	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
L483029	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
L483028	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
L482961	u7423	m502	MILLER	Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
L482960	u7424	m502	REIBEN	General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
L482913	u7423	m502	MILLER	Well, I, for one, like cheese.
L482912	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I'm listening, sir.
L482911	u7423	m502	MILLER	There's always a bright side.
L482910	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
L482909	u7423	m502	MILLER	There's to be a bright side, look for it.
L482908	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
L482907	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah, how so?
L482906	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
L482890	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
L482889	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, Reiben.
L482888	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, can I ask you a question?
L482858	u7424	m502	REIBEN	But, sir...
L482857	u7423	m502	MILLER	Trust me, you're the best.
L482856	u7424	m502	REIBEN	No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
L482855	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
L482854	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
L482853	u7423	m502	MILLER	Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
L482797	u7423	m502	MILLER	Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
L482796	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I don't think so, Captain.
L482793	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
L482792	u7423	m502	MILLER	There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
L482791	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
L482790	u7423	m502	MILLER	Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
L482789	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
L482788	u7424	m502	REIBEN	So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
L482782	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
L482781	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
L482745	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
L482744	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
L483603	u7423	m502	MILLER	Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
L483602	u7425	m502	RYAN	And Sarge?
L483601	u7423	m502	MILLER	Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
L483598	u7425	m502	RYAN	Yeah?
L483597	u7423	m502	MILLER	Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
L483596	u7425	m502	RYAN	Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
L483595	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yes, Private.
L483581	u7423	m502	MILLER	Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
L483580	u7425	m502	RYAN	FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
L483520	u7425	m502	RYAN	Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
L483519	u7423	m502	MILLER	Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
L483496	u7423	m502	MILLER	Struggling with a pair of Germans.
L483495	u7425	m502	RYAN	Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
L483476	u7425	m502	RYAN	Yes, sir.
L483475	u7423	m502	MILLER	You set?  Sarge nods.
L483463	u7425	m502	RYAN	I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
L483462	u7423	m502	MILLER	Don't do that again.
L483432	u7423	m502	MILLER	No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
L483431	u7425	m502	RYAN	I'd like to go, sir.
L483399	u7423	m502	MILLER	Alright, come with me.
L483398	u7425	m502	RYAN	Yes, sir.
L483397	u7423	m502	MILLER	Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
L483396	u7425	m502	RYAN	Thank you, sir.
L483378	u7425	m502	RYAN	I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
L483377	u7423	m502	MILLER	The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
L483374	u7423	m502	MILLER	This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
L483373	u7425	m502	RYAN	Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
L483372	u7423	m502	MILLER	Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
L483110	u7424	m502	REIBEN	...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
L483109	u7429	m502	WADE	Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
L483085	u7429	m502	WADE	We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
L483084	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
L483025	u7429	m502	WADE	Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
L483024	u7424	m502	REIBEN	You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
L483023	u7429	m502	WADE	Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
L483022	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
L483019	u7429	m502	WADE	As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
L483018	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
L483015	u7429	m502	WADE	No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
L483014	u7424	m502	REIBEN	That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
L483013	u7429	m502	WADE	So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
L483097	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
L483096	u7426	m502	SARGE	Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
L483042	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Captain, he's fast!
L483041	u7426	m502	SARGE	Damn fool.  Sir.
L482897	u7426	m502	SARGE	What are we likely to run into?
L482896	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I usually like surprises.
L482787	u7426	m502	SARGE	Yeah?  So?
L482786	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Lingerie.
L482785	u7426	m502	SARGE	Frogs?
L482784	u7424	m502	REIBEN	I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
L482783	u7426	m502	SARGE	Who cares?
L482778	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
L482777	u7426	m502	SARGE	Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
L482776	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Shit, sir.
L483543	u7424	m502	REIBEN	What about you, Captain?
L483542	u7428	m502	UPHAM	I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
L483250	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
L483249	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
L483248	u7424	m502	REIBEN	On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
L483193	u7424	m502	REIBEN	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
L483192	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
L482998	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
L482997	u7424	m502	REIBEN	We know.
L482996	u7428	m502	UPHAM	But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
L482977	u7424	m502	REIBEN	Get lost.
L482976	u7428	m502	UPHAM	So, where are you from?
L483196	u7429	m502	WADE	Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
L483195	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Twenty-four-five.
L483194	u7429	m502	WADE	How fast?
L483021	u7429	m502	WADE	Who knows?  It worked.
L483020	u7428	m502	UPHAM	You think he really believed it?
L483017	u7429	m502	WADE	It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
L483016	u7428	m502	UPHAM	How do you do it?
L482984	u7429	m502	WADE	Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
L482983	u7428	m502	UPHAM	Demolition, right?
L486268	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
L486267	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Now you're back.
L486266	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
L486265	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
L486264	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
L486263	u7450	m504	BRINNLITZ GUY 2	Oskar - my friend Lena.
L485991	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
L485990	u7451	m504	CLERK	The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
L485989	u7451	m504	CLERK	Klaus Tauber.
L485988	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
L485987	u7451	m504	CLERK	Sir, the list is correct.
L485986	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's your name?
L485985	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm talking to a clerk.
L485984	u7451	m504	CLERK	He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
L485983	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, let's find him.
L485982	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He is.
L485981	u7451	m504	CLERK	Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
L485980	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
L485882	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's up to you.
L485881	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Should I stay?
L485880	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's a beautiful city.
L485879	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Should I stay?
L485878	u7452	m504	EMILIE	I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
L485877	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What?
L485875	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	War.
L485874	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Luck.
L485872	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
L485871	u7452	m504	EMILIE	It's not a charade, all this?
L485863	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
L485862	u7452	m504	EMILIE	I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
L485861	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What -
L485860	u7452	m504	EMILIE	Oskar, please -
L485859	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You know what, you'd like her.
L486337	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
L486336	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	In Breslau.
L486335	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	All right, okay, let's talk.
L486334	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
L486333	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
L486332	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm sorry to hear that.
L486331	u7453	m504	GESTAPO	Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
L486477	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
L486476	u7454	m504	GOETH	Where are the guards?
L486286	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
L486285	u7454	m504	GOETH	Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
L486284	u7454	m504	GOETH	You did, but you didn't.
L486283	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I just told you.
L486282	u7454	m504	GOETH	If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
L486280	u7454	m504	GOETH	Yeah, sure.
L486279	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
L486278	u7454	m504	GOETH	You're not telling me something.
L486277	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Look -
L486276	u7454	m504	GOETH	"Oh, this is ""good business"" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense."
L486275	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's good business.
L486274	u7454	m504	GOETH	What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
L486273	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	These people, my people, I want my people.
L486272	u7454	m504	GOETH	You want these people.
L486255	u7454	m504	GOETH	I don't know.  Soon.
L486254	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	When?
L486253	u7454	m504	GOETH	They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
L486252	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You took my workers.
L486214	u7454	m504	GOETH	I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
L486213	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's going on?
L486212	u7454	m504	GOETH	I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
L486096	u7454	m504	GOETH	I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
L486095	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
L486094	u7454	m504	GOETH	He's important to my business.
L486093	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
L486091	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I pay you too much.
L486090	u7454	m504	GOETH	It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
L486064	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
L486063	u7454	m504	GOETH	Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
L486061	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	True.
L486060	u7454	m504	GOETH	That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
L486059	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah, what's that?
L486058	u7454	m504	GOETH	Scherner told me something else about you.
L486057	u7454	m504	GOETH	Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
L486056	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's bad business.
L486055	u7454	m504	GOETH	We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
L486054	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
L486053	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They're mine!
L486052	u7454	m504	GOETH	They're not gone, they're here.
L486051	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
L486049	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
L486048	u7454	m504	GOETH	He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
L486047	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You're kidding.
L486046	u7454	m504	GOETH	You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
L486039	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Good.
L486038	u7454	m504	GOETH	We started without you.
L486321	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
L486320	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What do I got for you?
L486319	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
L486318	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Of course I'm on it.
L486317	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
L485820	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Yeah, I can.
L485819	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
L485782	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Look it up.
L485781	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	This is not my problem.
L485780	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
L485779	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	So I'm responsible for the weather?
L485778	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
L485777	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	You asked for shoe polish.
L485776	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
L485775	u7455	m504	GOLDBERG	What's that?
L485925	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	You're a good man.
L485924	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah, okay.
L485923	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	God bless you, sir.
L485922	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	That's great, thanks.
L485921	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
L485920	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	That's great.
L485919	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
L485918	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
L485917	u7456	m504	LOWENSTEIN	I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
L486527	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
L486526	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
L486525	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
L486524	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
L486523	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
L486522	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What are you doing?
L486521	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Things are great, things are great.
L486520	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Good.  How's it going?
L486394	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
L486393	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	What's wrong with it?
L485904	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	She's good.
L485903	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
L485902	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Yeah.
L485901	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	How you feeling, all right?
L485794	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
L485793	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	How many?
L485792	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Nice things cost money.
L485791	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
L485790	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	There's nothing in the stores.
L485789	u7457	m504	PFEFFERBERG	Like this?
L486451	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
L486450	u7458	m504	RASCH	Pistols?
L486449	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It kind of looks that way.
L486448	u7458	m504	RASCH	We're losing the war, aren't we.
L486447	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
L486442	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Wine?
L486441	u7458	m504	RASCH	Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
L486440	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I need a drink.
L486439	u7458	m504	RASCH	Thank you.
L486437	u7458	m504	RASCH	How do you do?
L486436	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
L486435	u7458	m504	RASCH	Oskar, good of you to come.
L486200	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
L486199	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
L486194	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
L486193	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
L486192	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	So I'll talk to him about it.
L486191	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
L485847	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
L485846	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	That'd be fine.
L485844	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
L485843	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	What others?
L485842	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
L485841	u7459	m504	SCHERNER	I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
L486498	u7461	m504	STERN	You did so much.
L486497	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I didn't do enough.
L486496	u7461	m504	STERN	There will be generations because of what you did.
L486495	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
L486494	u7461	m504	STERN	Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
L486493	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
L486456	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, no, what, what is it?
L486455	u7461	m504	STERN	I'll talk to you later.
L486411	u7461	m504	STERN	You'll lose money.
L486410	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
L486409	u7461	m504	STERN	I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
L486406	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No?
L486405	u7461	m504	STERN	There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
L486404	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
L486403	u7461	m504	STERN	They're withholding payment.
L486402	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
L486399	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They arrived, can you believe it?
L486398	u7461	m504	STERN	They arrived.
L486397	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Stern.
L486396	u7461	m504	STERN	We need to talk.
L486389	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Yes.
L486388	u7461	m504	STERN	That's very generous of you.
L486299	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
L486298	u7461	m504	STERN	Eight hundred, give or take.
L486295	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	More.
L486294	u7461	m504	STERN	Four hundred, four fifty -
L486188	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
L486187	u7461	m504	STERN	I think it's too late.
L486186	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'll talk to him.
L486161	u7461	m504	STERN	There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
L486160	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
L486159	u7461	m504	STERN	And killing.
L486158	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
L486157	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
L486156	u7461	m504	STERN	What other point is -
L486155	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
L486154	u7461	m504	STERN	Are you losing money?
L486153	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
L486103	u7461	m504	STERN	Oskar -
L486102	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I got to go, I'll see you.
L486101	u7461	m504	STERN	Thank you.
L486100	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
L485955	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Ah, yes.
L485954	u7461	m504	STERN	Christmas presents.
L485953	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
L485932	u7461	m504	STERN	Do what?
L485931	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Don't ever do that to me again.
L485914	u7461	m504	STERN	There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
L485913	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What?
L485912	u7461	m504	STERN	The war could end.
L485911	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Any reason to think next month will be worse?
L485910	u7461	m504	STERN	Yes.
L485909	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Better this month than last?
L485908	u7461	m504	STERN	Yes.
L485907	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
L485833	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
L485832	u7461	m504	STERN	The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
L485831	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
L485774	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	They should be.
L485773	u7461	m504	STERN	I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
L485772	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Something they can hold in their hands.
L485771	u7461	m504	STERN	Pots and pans.
L485770	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
L485769	u7461	m504	STERN	Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
L485768	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Jews, yeah.  Investors.
L485766	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
L485765	u7461	m504	STERN	"Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a ""pleasure."""
L485763	u7461	m504	STERN	I think most people right now have other priorities.
L485762	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
L485759	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
L485758	u7461	m504	STERN	I was just the accountant.
L486196	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
L486195	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	He's stealing from you, Oskar.
L486190	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
L486189	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
L485942	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
L485941	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
L485939	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	No.
L485938	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	Would it do any good?
L485937	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
L485936	u7460	m504	SCHINDLER	I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
L485935	u7462	m504	TOFFEL	It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
L614995	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	An hour, two at most.
L614994	u8464	m574	SMITH	How much time?
L614991	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
L614990	u8464	m574	SMITH	The pumps --
L614989	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
L614988	u8464	m574	SMITH	That's right.
L614987	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
L615228	u8462	m574	ROSE	And to you, Mr. Andrews.
L615227	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Good luck to you, Rose.
L615225	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
L615224	u8462	m574	ROSE	Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
L615081	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Hurry, Rose.
L615080	u8462	m574	ROSE	Bottom, left, right. I have it.
L615079	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
L615078	u8462	m574	ROSE	No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
L615077	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	What? You have to get to a boat right away!
L615076	u8462	m574	ROSE	Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
L615026	u8462	m574	ROSE	Yes, I understand. Thank you.
L615025	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
L615023	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
L615022	u8462	m574	ROSE	You're certain?
L615021	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	The ship will sink.
L615020	u8462	m574	ROSE	I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
L614830	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
L614829	u8462	m574	ROSE	Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
L614755	u8446	m574	ANDREWS	Thank you, Rose.
L614754	u8462	m574	ROSE	Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
L615321	u8460	m574	LOVETT	It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
L615320	u8447	m574	BODINE	Rush her.
L615319	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Don't drop it Rose.
L615318	u8447	m574	BODINE	Holy shit.
L614594	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Lewis...
L614593	u8447	m574	BODINE	So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
L614430	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
L614429	u8447	m574	BODINE	We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
L614400	u8447	m574	BODINE	Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
L614399	u8460	m574	LOVETT	A hundred and one next month.
L614398	u8447	m574	BODINE	She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
L614370	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Get that outta my face.
L614369	u8447	m574	BODINE	You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
L614368	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Shit.
L614365	u8460	m574	LOVETT	You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
L614364	u8447	m574	BODINE	Who's the best? Say it.
L614358	u8447	m574	BODINE	I'm tryin' boss.
L614357	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
L614356	u8447	m574	BODINE	I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
L614611	u8458	m574	LIZZY	Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
L614610	u8448	m574	BROCK	That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
L614609	u8458	m574	LIZZY	What?
L614608	u8448	m574	BROCK	Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
L614607	u8458	m574	LIZZY	I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
L614606	u8448	m574	BROCK	Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
L614605	u8458	m574	LIZZY	Don't you mean work me?
L614604	u8448	m574	BROCK	Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
L614394	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
L614393	u8449	m574	BUELL	I told you you wanted to take this call.
L614391	u8460	m574	LOVETT	...Mrs. Calvert?
L614390	u8449	m574	BUELL	Rose Calvert.
L614389	u8460	m574	LOVETT	This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
L614388	u8449	m574	BUELL	No, trust me, you want to take this call.
L614387	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
L614386	u8449	m574	BUELL	There's a satellite call for you.
L614373	u8460	m574	LOVETT	How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
L614372	u8449	m574	BUELL	The partners want to know how it's going?
L615203	u8450	m574	CAL	I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
L615202	u8459	m574	LOVEJOY	What could possible be funny?
L615164	u8459	m574	LOVEJOY	There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
L615163	u8450	m574	CAL	We're too late.
L615147	u8459	m574	LOVEJOY	So do I.
L615146	u8450	m574	CAL	I make my own luck.
L615131	u8450	m574	CAL	Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
L615130	u8459	m574	LOVEJOY	The one on the other side is letting men in.
L615129	u8450	m574	CAL	We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
L615128	u8459	m574	LOVEJOY	She's not on the starboard side either.
L614877	u8450	m574	CAL	This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
L614876	u8459	m574	LOVEJOY	None of the stewards have seen her.
L615019	u8463	m574	RUTH	There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
L615018	u8450	m574	CAL	It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
L614515	u8450	m574	CAL	She knows.
L614514	u8463	m574	RUTH	You know I don't like that, Rose.
L614460	u8450	m574	CAL	All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
L614459	u8463	m574	RUTH	Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
L614458	u8450	m574	CAL	Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
L614449	u8450	m574	CAL	It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
L614448	u8463	m574	RUTH	So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
L614447	u8450	m574	CAL	Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
L615303	u8462	m574	ROSE	Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
L615302	u8450	m574	CAL	You're precious to me, Rose.
L615301	u8462	m574	ROSE	Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
L615300	u8450	m574	CAL	What do I tell your mother?
L615299	u8462	m574	ROSE	Is this in any way unclear?
L615297	u8450	m574	CAL	Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
L615296	u8462	m574	ROSE	Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
L615066	u8462	m574	ROSE	I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
L615065	u8450	m574	CAL	Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
L615059	u8450	m574	CAL	Not the better half.
L615058	u8462	m574	ROSE	Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
L614979	u8450	m574	CAL	Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
L614978	u8462	m574	ROSE	But I was with him the whole time.
L614968	u8450	m574	CAL	That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
L614967	u8462	m574	ROSE	Something serious has happened.
L614794	u8462	m574	ROSE	I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
L614793	u8450	m574	CAL	You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
L614792	u8462	m574	ROSE	I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
L614791	u8450	m574	CAL	Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
L614790	u8462	m574	ROSE	I was tired.
L614789	u8450	m574	CAL	I had hoped you would come to me last night.
L614586	u8462	m574	ROSE	The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
L614585	u8450	m574	CAL	It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
L614584	u8450	m574	CAL	Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
L614583	u8462	m574	ROSE	My God... Cal. Is it a --
L614574	u8450	m574	CAL	Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
L614573	u8462	m574	ROSE	Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
L614565	u8450	m574	CAL	You wanted to see the propellers?
L614564	u8462	m574	ROSE	I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
L614563	u8462	m574	ROSE	It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
L614562	u8450	m574	CAL	An accident?!
L614561	u8462	m574	ROSE	Cal, stop! It was an accident.
L614560	u8450	m574	CAL	What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
L614496	u8450	m574	CAL	He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
L614495	u8462	m574	ROSE	You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
L614494	u8450	m574	CAL	Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
L614463	u8462	m574	ROSE	I felt like black.
L614462	u8450	m574	CAL	I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
L614461	u8462	m574	ROSE	You told me to change.
L615196	u8450	m574	CAL	I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
L615195	u8455	m574	JACK	Almost as good as you.
L615194	u8450	m574	CAL	You're a good liar.
L615192	u8450	m574	CAL	Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
L615191	u8455	m574	JACK	I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
L615190	u8450	m574	CAL	There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
L614761	u8450	m574	CAL	Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
L614760	u8455	m574	JACK	No thanks. I'm heading back.
L614738	u8455	m574	JACK	No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
L614737	u8450	m574	CAL	Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
L614579	u8455	m574	JACK	Can I bum a cigarette?
L614578	u8450	m574	CAL	This should be amusing.
L614577	u8450	m574	CAL	Good. Settled then.
L614576	u8455	m574	JACK	Sure. Count me in.
L614575	u8450	m574	CAL	I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
L615137	u8455	m574	JACK	We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
L615136	u8451	m574	FABRIZIO	The boats are all going.
L614771	u8451	m574	FABRIZIO	I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
L614770	u8455	m574	JACK	How you two doin'?
L614491	u8455	m574	JACK	Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
L614490	u8451	m574	FABRIZIO	You know somebody?
L614479	u8451	m574	FABRIZIO	You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
L614478	u8455	m574	JACK	Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
L614475	u8451	m574	FABRIZIO	Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
L614474	u8455	m574	JACK	'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
L614473	u8455	m574	JACK	Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
L614472	u8451	m574	FABRIZIO	What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
L614471	u8455	m574	JACK	Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
L614932	u8456	m574	LEE	Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
L614931	u8452	m574	FLEET	Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
L614917	u8452	m574	FLEET	Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
L614916	u8456	m574	LEE	They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
L614915	u8452	m574	FLEET	Cor... look at that, would ya.
L614909	u8452	m574	FLEET	Well I can.
L614908	u8456	m574	LEE	Bollocks.
L614907	u8452	m574	FLEET	You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
L615269	u8453	m574	HITCHINS	If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
L615268	u8461	m574	MOLLY	I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
L615267	u8461	m574	MOLLY	Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
L615266	u8453	m574	HITCHINS	They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
L615155	u8453	m574	HITCHINS	No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
L615154	u8461	m574	MOLLY	We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
L615153	u8453	m574	HITCHINS	The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
L615072	u8461	m574	MOLLY	Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
L615071	u8453	m574	HITCHINS	Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
L614955	u8464	m574	SMITH	Excuse me.
L614954	u8454	m574	ISMAY	Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
L614953	u8464	m574	SMITH	We've struck ice.
L614952	u8454	m574	ISMAY	Why have we stopped?
L614679	u8454	m574	ISMAY	Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
L614678	u8464	m574	SMITH	I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
L614677	u8454	m574	ISMAY	Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
L614676	u8464	m574	SMITH	No, but we're making excellent time.
L614675	u8454	m574	ISMAY	So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
L615285	u8462	m574	ROSE	I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
L615284	u8455	m574	JACK	Never let go.
L615283	u8462	m574	ROSE	I promise.
L615282	u8455	m574	JACK	You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
L615280	u8455	m574	JACK	Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
L615279	u8462	m574	ROSE	I can't feel my body.
L615278	u8455	m574	JACK	You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
L615277	u8462	m574	ROSE	I'm so cold.
L615276	u8455	m574	JACK	No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
L615273	u8455	m574	JACK	Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
L615272	u8462	m574	ROSE	It's getting quiet.
L615253	u8455	m574	JACK	I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
L615252	u8462	m574	ROSE	It's so cold.
L615251	u8455	m574	JACK	Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
L615200	u8455	m574	JACK	Right.
L615199	u8462	m574	ROSE	You jump, I jump, right?
L615184	u8455	m574	JACK	Get in the boat, Rose.
L615183	u8462	m574	ROSE	I'm not going without you.
L615109	u8455	m574	JACK	We'll find out.
L615108	u8462	m574	ROSE	Will this work?
L615099	u8455	m574	JACK	I'll wait here.
L615098	u8462	m574	ROSE	I'll be right back.
L615097	u8455	m574	JACK	You have to go for help.
L615094	u8462	m574	ROSE	I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
L615093	u8455	m574	JACK	So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
L615092	u8455	m574	JACK	See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
L615091	u8462	m574	ROSE	I know, I know.
L615090	u8455	m574	JACK	That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
L614976	u8462	m574	ROSE	He couldn't have.
L614975	u8455	m574	JACK	Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
L614971	u8462	m574	ROSE	Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
L614970	u8455	m574	JACK	This is horseshit.
L614965	u8455	m574	JACK	Right.
L614964	u8462	m574	ROSE	Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
L614963	u8455	m574	JACK	Now it's worse.
L614962	u8462	m574	ROSE	We have to tell Mother and Cal.
L614961	u8455	m574	JACK	It's bad.
L614945	u8455	m574	JACK	It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
L614944	u8462	m574	ROSE	Could it have damaged the ship?
L614943	u8455	m574	JACK	Looks okay. I don't see anything.
L614914	u8462	m574	ROSE	I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
L614913	u8455	m574	JACK	This is crazy.
L614912	u8462	m574	ROSE	When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
L614904	u8455	m574	JACK	It's okay. I'm alright.
L614903	u8462	m574	ROSE	You're trembling.
L614896	u8462	m574	ROSE	Au contraire, mon cher.
L614895	u8455	m574	JACK	Are you nervous?
L614894	u8462	m574	ROSE	To the stars.
L614893	u8455	m574	JACK	Where to, Miss?
L614889	u8455	m574	JACK	Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
L614888	u8462	m574	ROSE	He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
L614887	u8455	m574	JACK	Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
L614870	u8455	m574	JACK	He does landscapes.
L614869	u8462	m574	ROSE	I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
L614864	u8462	m574	ROSE	A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
L614863	u8455	m574	JACK	What is it? A sapphire?
L614862	u8462	m574	ROSE	Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
L614861	u8455	m574	JACK	Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
L614860	u8462	m574	ROSE	Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
L614858	u8455	m574	JACK	Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
L614857	u8462	m574	ROSE	Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
L614847	u8455	m574	JACK	Sssshh. Come here.
L614846	u8462	m574	ROSE	Fabrizio said you might be up --
L614841	u8462	m574	ROSE	I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
L614840	u8455	m574	JACK	You're right. Only you can do that.
L614839	u8462	m574	ROSE	It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
L614838	u8455	m574	JACK	I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
L614837	u8462	m574	ROSE	You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
L614836	u8455	m574	JACK	No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
L614835	u8462	m574	ROSE	Jack, I --
L614834	u8455	m574	JACK	Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
L614785	u8462	m574	ROSE	I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
L614784	u8455	m574	JACK	That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
L614783	u8462	m574	ROSE	I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
L614782	u8455	m574	JACK	Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
L614781	u8462	m574	ROSE	A mistake?
L614780	u8455	m574	JACK	You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
L614768	u8455	m574	JACK	Just move with me. Don't think.
L614767	u8462	m574	ROSE	I don't know the steps.
L614766	u8455	m574	JACK	You're still my best girl, Cora.
L614765	u8462	m574	ROSE	May I cut in, miss?
L614763	u8455	m574	JACK	Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
L614762	u8462	m574	ROSE	Jack, must you go?
L614716	u8462	m574	ROSE	Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
L614715	u8455	m574	JACK	I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
L614696	u8455	m574	JACK	They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
L614695	u8462	m574	ROSE	I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
L614694	u8455	m574	JACK	Sure. If you like.
L614693	u8462	m574	ROSE	You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
L614692	u8455	m574	JACK	Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
L614691	u8462	m574	ROSE	Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
L614690	u8455	m574	JACK	Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
L614689	u8462	m574	ROSE	A whole ten cents?!
L614688	u8455	m574	JACK	Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
L614687	u8462	m574	ROSE	So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
L614684	u8462	m574	ROSE	Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
L614683	u8455	m574	JACK	I'm sorry. Really... I am.
L614682	u8462	m574	ROSE	Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
L614681	u8455	m574	JACK	You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
L614680	u8462	m574	ROSE	You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
L614670	u8455	m574	JACK	You wouldn'ta jumped.
L614669	u8462	m574	ROSE	And...?
L614668	u8455	m574	JACK	I see you.
L614667	u8462	m574	ROSE	You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
L614666	u8455	m574	JACK	No, no! Just with her hands.
L614665	u8462	m574	ROSE	I think you must have had a love affair with her...
L614664	u8455	m574	JACK	She had beautiful hands.
L614663	u8462	m574	ROSE	You liked this woman. You used her several times.
L614662	u8455	m574	JACK	Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
L614661	u8462	m574	ROSE	And these were drawn from life?
L614657	u8455	m574	JACK	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
L614656	u8462	m574	ROSE	Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
L614655	u8455	m574	JACK	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
L614654	u8462	m574	ROSE	Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
L614653	u8462	m574	ROSE	May I?
L614652	u8455	m574	JACK	Just some sketches.
L614651	u8462	m574	ROSE	What's this?
L614650	u8455	m574	JACK	Well, I guess I will tonight.
L614649	u8462	m574	ROSE	Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
L614648	u8455	m574	JACK	It is that simple.
L614647	u8462	m574	ROSE	If only it were that simple.
L614646	u8455	m574	JACK	So don't marry him.
L614645	u8462	m574	ROSE	Yes, exactly!
L614644	u8455	m574	JACK	So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
L614642	u8462	m574	ROSE	Worse I'm afraid.
L614641	u8455	m574	JACK	Is he your boyfriend?
L614640	u8462	m574	ROSE	Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
L614639	u8455	m574	JACK	That penguin last night, is he one of them?
L614638	u8462	m574	ROSE	Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
L614637	u8455	m574	JACK	Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
L614636	u8462	m574	ROSE	I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
L614635	u8455	m574	JACK	That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
L614634	u8462	m574	ROSE	Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
L614633	u8455	m574	JACK	You're welcome. Rose.
L614632	u8462	m574	ROSE	Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
L614631	u8455	m574	JACK	Well, here you are.
L614630	u8462	m574	ROSE	Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
L614629	u8455	m574	JACK	Jack.
L614628	u8462	m574	ROSE	Mr. Dawson, I --
L614627	u8455	m574	JACK	That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
L614626	u8462	m574	ROSE	Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
L614625	u8455	m574	JACK	So, you got a name by the way?
L614624	u8455	m574	JACK	Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
L614623	u8462	m574	ROSE	Could I speak to you in private?
L614622	u8455	m574	JACK	Hello again.
L614557	u8455	m574	JACK	I've got you. I won't let go.
L614556	u8462	m574	ROSE	HELP! HELP!!
L614555	u8462	m574	ROSE	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
L614554	u8455	m574	JACK	I'm Jack Dawson.
L614551	u8455	m574	JACK	That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
L614550	u8462	m574	ROSE	You're crazy.
L614549	u8455	m574	JACK	Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
L614548	u8462	m574	ROSE	I know what ice fishing is!
L614547	u8455	m574	JACK	Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
L614546	u8462	m574	ROSE	No.
L614545	u8455	m574	JACK	Ever been to Wisconsin?
L614544	u8455	m574	JACK	Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
L614543	u8462	m574	ROSE	How cold?
L614542	u8455	m574	JACK	It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
L614541	u8462	m574	ROSE	The fall alone would kill you.
L614539	u8462	m574	ROSE	Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
L614538	u8455	m574	JACK	I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
L614537	u8462	m574	ROSE	You're distracting me. Go away.
L614536	u8455	m574	JACK	You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
L614535	u8462	m574	ROSE	What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
L614534	u8455	m574	JACK	No you won't.
L614533	u8462	m574	ROSE	No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
L614532	u8455	m574	JACK	Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
L614883	u8464	m574	SMITH	And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
L614882	u8457	m574	LIGHTOLLER	Yes sir.
L614881	u8464	m574	SMITH	Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
L614880	u8457	m574	LIGHTOLLER	It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
L614879	u8464	m574	SMITH	Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
L614878	u8457	m574	LIGHTOLLER	I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
L615312	u8460	m574	LOVETT	We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
L615311	u8458	m574	LIZZY	I'm sorry.
L614616	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
L614615	u8458	m574	LIZZY	You think she was really there?
L614614	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
L614613	u8458	m574	LIZZY	What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
L614612	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
L614599	u8458	m574	LIZZY	That's enough.
L614598	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
L614418	u8460	m574	LOVETT	If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
L614417	u8458	m574	LIZZY	April 14, 1912.
L615316	u8460	m574	LOVETT	You had it the entire time?!
L615315	u8462	m574	ROSE	Don't come any closer.
L614597	u8462	m574	ROSE	I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
L614596	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
L614592	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
L614591	u8462	m574	ROSE	I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
L614443	u8462	m574	ROSE	It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
L614442	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Just tell us what you can --
L614441	u8462	m574	ROSE	It's been 84 years...
L614416	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
L614415	u8462	m574	ROSE	Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
L614414	u8460	m574	LOVETT	I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
L614411	u8462	m574	ROSE	It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
L614410	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
L614409	u8462	m574	ROSE	I should like to see my drawing.
L614408	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Would you like anything?
L614407	u8462	m574	ROSE	There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
L614404	u8462	m574	ROSE	Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
L614403	u8460	m574	LOVETT	Is your stateroom alright?
L615064	u8462	m574	ROSE	Goodbye, mother.
L615063	u8463	m574	RUTH	Rose, get in the boat!
L614806	u8463	m574	RUTH	Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
L614805	u8462	m574	ROSE	It's so unfair.
L614804	u8463	m574	RUTH	Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
L614803	u8462	m574	ROSE	How can you put this on my shoulders?
L614802	u8463	m574	RUTH	I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
L614801	u8463	m574	RUTH	Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
L614800	u8462	m574	ROSE	Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
L614799	u8463	m574	RUTH	Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
L614701	u8463	m574	RUTH	Charmed, I'm sure.
L614700	u8462	m574	ROSE	Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
L614521	u8462	m574	ROSE	Excuse me.
L614520	u8463	m574	RUTH	My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
L616650	u8484	m576	DOC	Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.

L666462	u9026	m616	BOY-PULLEN	Why don 't the Zulus attack?
L666368	u9025	m616	BLOOMFIELD	One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!

L666503	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
L666398	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
L666397	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
L666396	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
L666395	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	"If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but ""why?"" is the question my readers will ask. ""why?"""

L666393	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
L666392	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
L666391	u9032	m616	NORRIS-NEWMAN	Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.

L666484	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I'm explaining my reasons.
L666483	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
L666482	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
L666481	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
L666480	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
L666358	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
L666357	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
L666250	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
L666249	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
L666248	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
L666247	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.

L666485	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Yes?
L666461	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Thank you.
L666460	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
L666385	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
L666384	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	"Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from ""The Standard""."
L666383	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
L666252	u9027	m616	CHELMSFORD	But will they make good use of them?
L666251	u9029	m616	CREALOCK	Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
L666502	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
L666501	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
L666500	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
L666499	u9028	m616	COGHILL	How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
L666498	u9033	m616	STUART SMITH	Yes.
L666497	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Stuart?
L666576	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
L666575	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
L666327	u9031	m616	MELVILL	ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
L666326	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
L666325	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Which one?
L666324	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
L666264	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
L666263	u9028	m616	COGHILL	Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
L666262	u9031	m616	MELVILL	Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
L666522	u9034	m616	VEREKER	So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there. 
L666521	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
L666520	u9034	m616	VEREKER	Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
L666372	u9034	m616	VEREKER	I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
L666371	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
L666370	u9034	m616	VEREKER	I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
L666369	u9030	m616	DURNFORD	Your orders, Mr Vereker?
